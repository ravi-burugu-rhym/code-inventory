       " '31. Executive SummaryFrom late 2013 onwards, several banks and ˜nancial institutions have been attacked by an unknown group of cybercriminals. In all these attacks, a similar modus operandi was used. According to victims and the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) involved in the investigation, this could result in cumulative losses of up to 1 billion USD. The attacks are still active. This report provides a technical analysis of these attacks. The motivation for the attackers, who are making use of techniques commonly seen in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), appears to be ˜nancial gain as opposed to espionage. An analysis of the campaign has revealed that the initial infections were achieved using spear phishing emails that appeared to be legitimate banking communications, with Microsoft Word 97 Œ 2003 (.doc) and Control Panel Applet (.CPL) ˜les attached. We believe that the attackers also redirected to˚exploit kits website traf˜c that related to ˜nancial activity. The email attachments exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Of˜ce 2003, 2007 and 2010 (CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2013-3906) and Microsoft Word (CVE-2014- 1761). Once the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the shellcode decrypts and executes the backdoor known as Carbanak. Carbanak is a remote backdoor (initially based on Carberp), designed for espionage, data ex˜ltration and to provide remote access to infected machines. Once access is achieved, attackers perform a manual reconnaissance of the victim™s networks. Based on the results of this operation, the attackers use different lateral movement tools in order to get access to the critical systems in the victim´s infrastructure. They then install additional software such as the Ammyy Remote Administration Tool, or even compromise SSH servers. Notably, some of the latest versions of the analyzed Carbanak malware appear not to use any Carberp source code. Once the attackers successfully compromise the victim´s network, the primary internal destinations are money processing services, Automated Teller Machines (ATM) and ˜nancial accounts. In some cases, the attackers used the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network to transfer money to their accounts. In others, Oracle databases were manipulated to open payment or debit card accounts at the same bank or to transfer money between',\n",
       " '4accounts using the online banking system. The ATM network was also used to dispense cash from certain ATMs at certain times where money mules were ready to collect it.As part of the attack´s reconnaissance phase, video recordings of the activities of bank employees, particularly system administrators, were made. The videos were sent to the C2 server. Please note that the attackers abused the aforementioned services by impersonating legitimate local users who had the permissions to perform the actions later reproduced by the cybercriminals. As far as we know, none of the aforementioned services were attacked nor was any speci˜c vulnerability within them exploited.Of the 100 banking entities impacted at the time of writing this report, at least half have suffered ˜nancial losses. Most of the victims based in the geolocation of infected IPs are located in Russia, USA, Germany, China and Ukraine. That does not necessarily mean that all these victims are banking entities. The magnitude of the losses is signi˜cant. For example, one victim lost approximately $7.3 million (USD) due to ATM fraud; another suffered a $10 million (USD) loss due to the exploitation of its online banking platform. Stolen funds were transferred out of the affected countries to bank accounts in the US and China. Additionally some of the C2 servers have log entries indicating connections to systems located in the US. Telemetry indicates that the attackers are expanding operations to other regions, such as Asia, the Middle-East, Africa and Europe. This report discusses the attack vectors, infection mechanisms and toolkits used by the attackers to exploit the network after the initial infection, as well as the operational details and geographical distribution of this campaign.',\n",
       " '52. Analysis During the spring of 2014, Kaspersky Lab was involved in a forensic analysis of ATMs dispensing cash to people located near them but with no physical interaction according to security cameras. No malware was detected on these ATMs. However, Carberp-like malware was found on a computer that was connected to them via VPN. Following the investigation of this incident, in the summer of 2014, Kaspersky Lab identi˜ed the same Carberp-like malware in another investigation involving a bank, where criminals were able to gain access to its online banking systems. In this investigation, we started analyzing all the computers in the bank™s infrastructure in order to ˜nd the source of the infection. We found spear phishing emails with CPL ˜les attached that, after a successful infection, install the same Carberp-like malware we had previously found in the case involving the ATMs. There is evidence indicating that in most cases the network was compromised for between two to four months, and that many hundreds of computers within a single victim organization may have been infected. This period of time was used by the attackers to get access to the right victims and critical systems, and to learn how to operate their tools and systems to get the cash out. Carbanak contains an espionage component that allows the attackers to take control of video capabilities on the victim systems. Thanks to this, long term observation and reconnaissance could be conducted. This allowed the attackers to understand the protocols and daily operational tempo of their targets. Based on this understanding, exploitation methodologies and mechanisms were developed and tailored to each victim. 2.1 Infection and Transmission All observed cases used spear phishing emails with Microsoft Word 97 Œ 2003 (.doc) ˜les attached or CPL ˜les. The doc ˜les exploit both Microsoft Of˜ce (CVE- 2012-0158 and CVE-2013-3906) and Microsoft Word (CVE- 2014-1761). There are indicators that point to a possible Chinese origin for the exploits used in these attachments. Command and Control (C2) servers located in China have been identi˜ed in this campaign. In addition, registration information for some of the domains use details of supposedly Chinese citizens. Obviously, all this could just be a red herring.',\n",
       " \"6The targets were all employees af˜liated to the affected institution. The spear phishing email messages appeared legitimate and in some cases were sent from compromised coworkers´ accounts. In this way compromised systems were used as a transmission vector. Given that the victims were mostly Russian-speaking ˜nancial institutions, the names of the attachments we have identi˜ed were generally in Russian. anslate into ﬁAccordance to Federal Lawﬂ and ﬁInvitationﬂ respectively. This is enough to induce a typical employee to open the attachment and execute the malware. For a complete list of ˜le names see Appendix 4.The following is an example of a Carbanak spear phishing email:Translated: In this case, the attachment was a CPL ˜le compressed using the Roshal Archive (.rar) format. Once the remote code execution vulnerability is successfully exploited, it installs Carbanak on the victim's system. The complete list of observed spear phishing emails can be found in Appendix 1 Œ Spear phishing.An additional infection vector that we believe was used by the criminals is a˚classical drive-by-download attack. We have found traces of the Null and the˚RedKit exploits kits.\",\n",

Null Exploit Kit Œ statistics on victims, found in one Carbanak C2 The image above translates as Country_name, All visitors, Unique visitors, Banned visitor, Revoked infections, Infected. 2.2 Malware Analysis Œ Backdoor.Win32.Carbanak Carbanak is a backdoor used by the attackers to compromise the victim's machine once the exploit, either in the spear phishing email or exploit kit, successfully executes its payload. This section provides a functional analysis of Carbanak™s capabilities.Carbanak copies itself into ﬁ%system32%\\\\comﬂ with the name ﬁsvchost.exeﬂ with the ˜le attributes: system, hidden and read-only. The original ˜le created by the exploit payload is then deleted.To ensure that Carbanak has autorun privileges the malware creates a new service. The naming syntax is ﬁ<ServiceName>Sysﬂ where ServiceName is any existing service randomly chosen, with the ˜rst character deleted. For example, if the existing service´s name is ﬁaspnetﬂ and the visible name is ﬁAsp.net state\",\n",
       " '8serviceﬂ, the service created by the malware would be ﬁaspnetSysﬂ with a visible name of ﬁSp.net state serviceﬂ. Before creating the malicious service, Carbanak determines if either the avp.exe or avpui.exe processes (components of Kaspersky Internet Security) is running. If found on the target system, Carbanak will try to exploit a known vulnerability in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, CVE-2013-3660, for local privilege escalation. We believe this is not relevant and that the˚attackers adapt their tools to the victim´s defenses. Carbanak creates a ˜le with a random name and a .bin extension in %COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Mozilla where it stores commands to be executed. Then˚the malware gets the proxy con˜guration from the registry entry: [HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Internet Settings] and the Mozilla Firefox con˜guration ˜le in: %AppData%\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\<Pro˜leName>\\\\prefs.js How to detect Carbanak One of the best methods for detecting Carbanak is to look for .bin ˜les in the folder:..\\\\All users\\\\%AppData%\\\\Mozilla\\\\ The malware saves ˜les in this location that will later be sent to the C2 server when an internet connection is detected. A .BAT script for detecting infections is provided in the Appendixes. Additionally, Carbanak can obtain proxy con˜guration information from headers sent through an application via SOCKS or HTTP. Carbanak injects its code into svchost.exe . Most of the actions described below happen within this process. Carbanak downloads the ˜le kldcon˜g.plug from its C2 server. This ˜le includes the names of the processes to be monitored. Once the system is infected, Carbanak logs keystrokes and takes screenshots every 20 seconds. This monitoring is performed by intercepting the ResumeThread call.',\n",
       " '9To enable connections to the infected computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Carbanak sets Termservice service execution mode to Auto. Also, after executing this service, it modi˜es the executable code in memory in order to establish simultaneous work processes for both remote and local users. Modules modi˜ed in this process are: termsrv.dll , csrsrv.dll , msgina.dll and winlogon.exe .If Carbanak detects the banking application BLIZKO (funds transfer software) in the infected computer, it sends a special noti˜cation to its C2 server. Carbanak is also aware of the IFOBS banking application and can, on command, substitute the details of payment documents in the IFOBS system.To communicate with its C2 server, Carbanak uses the HTTP protocol with RC2+Base64 encryption, adding additional characters not included in Base64. It˚also inserts strings with different extensions (.gif,.htm, etc.) at random locations in the HTTP request. Example of a typical Carbanak request: Carbanak sends its collected monitoring data to its C2 server. It also receives commands. The commands are compared with a hash table; if there is a match Carbanak performs the associated action: HashCommandDescription0AA37987Executes all commands stored in the con˜guration ˜le. 7AA8A5state Sets malware sta 7CFABF videoSends captured screen or process window video to C2. 6E533C4downloadDownloads and runs executable ˜le from C2.

       " '18 Figure 10. Geographical distribution of victims according to C2 data 2.3 Lateral movement tools Carbanak uses different tools on infected systems, each one with a different purpose. There appears to be a preference for the Ammyy Admin remote administration tool for remote control. Speci˜cally, the attackers have been detected uploading:Ammyy Admin 3.5 (f8cd52b70a11a1fb3f29c6f89ff971ec) as svchost.exe It is believed that the attackers used this remote administration tool because it˚is commonly whitelisted in the victims™ environments as a result of being used˚regularly by administrators. In another instance, a Secure Shell (SSH) backdoor was used to communicate with the C2 server in 190.97.165.126 (operatemesscont.net). This indicates that the attackers did not limit themselves to Microsoft Windows environments. In this case, the victim used the Telnet/SSH client PuTTY to connect to the server, and the attackers recompiled the machine™s SSH daemon with a backdoor so they could gain direct access. Logs for these tools indicate that they were accessed from two different IPs, probably used by the attackers, and located in Ukraine and France. We have also found traces of many different tools used by the attackers inside the victim´s network to gain control of additional systems, such as Metasploit, PsExec or Mimikatz.',\n",
       " '192.4 Command and Control (C2) Servers There appear to be four distinct types of C2 servers: Linux servers used for issuing commands to deployed Carbanak instances and for receiving collected monitoring data; Windows servers used for remote connections to victim systems; Backup servers; and Drop servers where additional executable ˜les (e.g. remote administration tools) are hosted. Server rotation occurs more or less on a biweekly basis. For a complete list of identi˜ed Carbanak servers please check the regularly updated Carbanak IOC document. The current list of IOCs is provided at Appendix 3 in his document. Some of these C2 servers are responsible for dropping Ammyy (con˜guration and executable ˜les), the KLG plugin con˜guration (list of processes to monitor) and the VNC server (both 32 and 64 bits to be injected in rundll). In one of the observed servers there was also a Metasploit module. Figure 11. Carbanak administration panel running in Linux',\n",

       " '21Attacker´s operational details Additionally, the malicious servers contain video ˜les that capture a victim´s activity. While the videos are stored using a compressed format which provides poor image quality, the selected format minimizes upload bandwith and is of suf˜cient quality for the attackers to understand the victims™ activities. The video ˜le naming conventions used the name of the application in the foreground (e.g., Outlook, Cmd, etc.) and only recorded user activity. This helped the attackers to both navigate to ˜les of interest and to discar Figure 14. Special video player designed to watch Carbanak´s video stream Using the intelligence gained from video and other monitoring techniques, the attackers developed an operational pictur, tooling and practices. This picture helps the attackers to deploy their malicious operations, for example:Attackers created fake transactions in the victim™s internal database after the˚veri˜cation process, thus avoiding discovery of the fraudulent activity; Attackers used the victim™s internal command utilities to insert fraudulent operations in the transaction queue. In general, the attackers demonstrated great versatility, using attack methodologies best suited to a speci˜c victim™s operational methodology. However, they seemed to deliberately limit the amount of money stolen per victim to $10 million USD. This limit may be explained as the maximum amount',\n",
       " '22of money that can be transferred via mule services, or the maximum amount of money that is budgeted in banks for fraud risks in order to minimize the chances of LEAs and the bank´s anti-fraud teams from doing a full blown analysis. Figure 15. List of PIN KVC used on ATMs Sensitive bank documents have be found on the servers that were controlling Carbanak. They included classi˜ed emails, manuals, crypto keys, passwords and˚so on. For example, the ˜le in the above ˜gure has KVC (key veri˜cation codes) keys that are used by ATMs to check the integrity of the PIN numbers of its users. In other cases involving ATMs, the criminals were able to control computers that had access to the internal ATM network. If the bank had enabled remote access to ATMs, the criminals started using this access to remotely withdraw cash. Criminals used no malware to operate the ATM dispenser; instead they used standard utilities to control and test ATM equipment.',\n",
       " '233. ConclusionsMalware targeting the ˜nance industry (both companies and consumers) continues to evolve. The Carbanak malware used in the on-going campaign described in this report has been very successful in terms of generating revenue. Of particular interest are the attack methods, similar to those used in sophisticated cyber-espionage APTs. As such, they represent a new and disturbing trend in the cybercrime market of increasing attack sophistication. Despite increased awareness of cybercrime within the ˜nancial services sector, it appears that spear phishing attacks and old exploits (for which patches have been disseminated) remain effective against larger companies. Attackers always use this minimal effort approach in order to bypass a victim´s defenses. Advanced control and fraud detection systems have been used for years by the ˜nancial services industry. However, these focus on fraudulent transactions within customer accounts. The Carbanak attackers bypassed these protections, by for example, using the industry-wide funds transfer (the SWIFT network), updating balances of account holders and using disbursement mechanisms (the ATM network). In neither of these cases did the attackers exploit a vulnerability within the service. Instead, they studied the victim´s internal procedures and pinpointed who they should impersonate locally in order to process fraudulent transactions through the aforementioned services. It is clear that the attackers were very familiar with ˜nancial services software and networks. As part of an automated reconnaissance phase, the Carbanak malware checked victim systems for the presence of specialized and speci˜c banking software. Only after the presence of banking systems was con˜rmed, were victims further exploited. To date, attacks against approximately 300 IP addresses around the world have been observed on analyzed C2s. It is possible that these attacks were coordinated to maximize returns prior to industry-wide information sharing and the implementation of countermeasures. Existing telemetry indicates that the Carbanak attackers are trying to expand operations to other Baltic and Central Europe countries, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Carbanak may be responsible for losses as high as $1 billion USD. We believe that the Carbanak campaign is a clear indicator of a new era in cybercrime in which criminals use APT techniques directly against the ˜nancial industry instead of through its customers.

      "31. Executive SummaryFrom late 2013 onwards, several banks and ˜nancial institutions have been attacked by an unknown group of cybercriminals. In all these attacks, a similar modus operandi was used. According to victims and the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) involved in the investigation, this could result in cumulative losses of up to 1 billion USD. The attacks are still active. This report provides a technical analysis of these attacks. The motivation for the attackers, who are making use of techniques commonly seen in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), appears to be ˜nancial gain as opposed to espionage. An analysis of the campaign has revealed that the initial infections were achieved using spear phishing emails that appeared to be legitimate banking communications, with Microsoft Word 97 Œ 2003 (.doc) and Control Panel Applet (.CPL) ˜les attached. We believe that the attackers also redirected to˚exploit kits website traf˜c that related to ˜nancial activity. The email attachments exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Of˜ce 2003, 2007 and 2010 (CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2013-3906) and Microsoft Word (CVE-2014- 1761). Once the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the shellcode decrypts and executes the backdoor known as Carbanak. Carbanak is a remote backdoor (initially based on Carberp), designed for espionage, data ex˜ltration and to provide remote access to infected machines. Once access is achieved, attackers perform a manual reconnaissance of the victim™s networks. Based on the results of this operation, the attackers use different lateral movement tools in order to get access to the critical systems in the victim´s infrastructure. They then install additional software such as the Ammyy Remote Administration Tool, or even compromise SSH servers. Notably, some of the latest versions of the analyzed Carbanak malware appear not to use any Carberp source code. Once the attackers successfully compromise the victim´s network, the primary internal destinations are money processing services, Automated Teller Machines (ATM) and ˜nancial accounts. In some cases, the attackers used the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network to transfer money to their accounts. In others, Oracle databases were manipulated to open payment or debit card accounts at the same bank or to transfer money between\n",
      "4accounts using the online banking system. The ATM network was also used to dispense cash from certain ATMs at certain times where money mules were ready to collect it.As part of the attack´s reconnaissance phase, video recordings of the activities of bank employees, particularly system administrators, were made. The videos were sent to the C2 server. Please note that the attackers abused the aforementioned services by impersonating legitimate local users who had the permissions to perform the actions later reproduced by the cybercriminals. As far as we know, none of the aforementioned services were attacked nor was any speci˜c vulnerability within them exploited.Of the 100 banking entities impacted at the time of writing this report, at least half have suffered ˜nancial losses. Most of the victims based in the geolocation of infected IPs are located in Russia, USA, Germany, China and Ukraine. That does not necessarily mean that all these victims are banking entities. The magnitude of the losses is signi˜cant. For example, one victim lost approximately $7.3 million (USD) due to ATM fraud; another suffered a $10 million (USD) loss due to the exploitation of its online banking platform. Stolen funds were transferred out of the affected countries to bank accounts in the US and China. Additionally some of the C2 servers have log entries indicating connections to systems located in the US. Telemetry indicates that the attackers are expanding operations to other regions, such as Asia, the Middle-East, Africa and Europe. This report discusses the attack vectors, infection mechanisms and toolkits used by the attackers to exploit the network after the initial infection, as well as the operational details and geographical distribution of this campaign.\n",
      "52. Analysis During the spring of 2014, Kaspersky Lab was involved in a forensic analysis of ATMs dispensing cash to people located near them but with no physical interaction according to security cameras. No malware was detected on these ATMs. However, Carberp-like malware was found on a computer that was connected to them via VPN. Following the investigation of this incident, in the summer of 2014, Kaspersky Lab identi˜ed the same Carberp-like malware in another investigation involving a bank, where criminals were able to gain access to its online banking systems. In this investigation, we started analyzing all the computers in the bank™s infrastructure in order to ˜nd the source of the infection. We found spear phishing emails with CPL ˜les attached that, after a successful infection, install the same Carberp-like malware we had previously found in the case involving the ATMs. There is evidence indicating that in most cases the network was compromised for between two to four months, and that many hundreds of computers within a single victim organization may have been infected. This period of time was used by the attackers to get access to the right victims and critical systems, and to learn how to operate their tools and systems to get the cash out. Carbanak contains an espionage component that allows the attackers to take control of video capabilities on the victim systems. Thanks to this, long term observation and reconnaissance could be conducted. This allowed the attackers to understand the protocols and daily operational tempo of their targets. Based on this understanding, exploitation methodologies and mechanisms were developed and tailored to each victim. 2.1 Infection and Transmission All observed cases used spear phishing emails with Microsoft Word 97 Œ 2003 (.doc) ˜les attached or CPL ˜les. The doc ˜les exploit both Microsoft Of˜ce (CVE- 2012-0158 and CVE-2013-3906) and Microsoft Word (CVE- 2014-1761). There are indicators that point to a possible Chinese origin for the exploits used in these attachments. Command and Control (C2) servers located in China have been identi˜ed in this campaign. In addition, registration information for some of the domains use details of supposedly Chinese citizens. Obviously, all this could just be a red herring.\n",
      "6The targets were all employees af˜liated to the affected institution. The spear phishing email messages appeared legitimate and in some cases were sent from compromised coworkers´ accounts. In this way compromised systems were used as a transmission vector. Given that the victims were mostly Russian-speaking ˜nancial institutions, the names of the attachments we have identi˜ed were generally in Russian. anslate into ﬁAccordance to Federal Lawﬂ and ﬁInvitationﬂ respectively. This is enough to induce a typical employee to open the attachment and execute the malware. For a complete list of ˜le names see Appendix 4.The following is an example of a Carbanak spear phishing email:Translated: In this case, the attachment was a CPL ˜le compressed using the Roshal Archive (.rar) format. Once the remote code execution vulnerability is successfully exploited, it installs Carbanak on the victim's system. The complete list of observed spear phishing emails can be found in Appendix 1 Œ Spear phishing.An additional infection vector that we believe was used by the criminals is a˚classical drive-by-download attack. We have found traces of the Null and the˚RedKit exploits kits.\n",
      "7 Figure 1. Null Exploit Kit Œ statistics on victims, found in one Carbanak C2 The image above translates as Country_name, All visitors, Unique visitors, Banned visitor, Revoked infections, Infected. 2.2 Malware Analysis Œ Backdoor.Win32.Carbanak Carbanak is a backdoor used by the attackers to compromise the victim's machine once the exploit, either in the spear phishing email or exploit kit, successfully executes its payload. This section provides a functional analysis of Carbanak™s capabilities.Carbanak copies itself into ﬁ%system32%\\comﬂ with the name ﬁsvchost.exeﬂ with the ˜le attributes: system, hidden and read-only. The original ˜le created by the exploit payload is then deleted.To ensure that Carbanak has autorun privileges the malware creates a new service. The naming syntax is ﬁ<ServiceName>Sysﬂ where ServiceName is any existing service randomly chosen, with the ˜rst character deleted. For example, if the existing service´s name is ﬁaspnetﬂ and the visible name is ﬁAsp.net state\n",
      "8serviceﬂ, the service created by the malware would be ﬁaspnetSysﬂ with a visible name of ﬁSp.net state serviceﬂ. Before creating the malicious service, Carbanak determines if either the avp.exe or avpui.exe processes (components of Kaspersky Internet Security) is running. If found on the target system, Carbanak will try to exploit a known vulnerability in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, CVE-2013-3660, for local privilege escalation. We believe this is not relevant and that the˚attackers adapt their tools to the victim´s defenses. Carbanak creates a ˜le with a random name and a .bin extension in %COMMON_APPDATA%\\Mozilla where it stores commands to be executed. Then˚the malware gets the proxy con˜guration from the registry entry: [HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings] and the Mozilla Firefox con˜guration ˜le in: %AppData%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\<Pro˜leName>\\prefs.js How to detect Carbanak One of the best methods for detecting Carbanak is to look for .bin ˜les in the folder:..\\All users\\%AppData%\\Mozilla\\ The malware saves ˜les in this location that will later be sent to the C2 server when an internet connection is detected. A .BAT script for detecting infections is provided in the Appendixes. Additionally, Carbanak can obtain proxy con˜guration information from headers sent through an application via SOCKS or HTTP. Carbanak injects its code into svchost.exe . Most of the actions described below happen within this process. Carbanak downloads the ˜le kldcon˜g.plug from its C2 server. This ˜le includes the names of the processes to be monitored. Once the system is infected, Carbanak logs keystrokes and takes screenshots every 20 seconds. This monitoring is performed by intercepting the ResumeThread call.\n",
      "9To enable connections to the infected computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Carbanak sets Termservice service execution mode to Auto. Also, after executing this service, it modi˜es the executable code in memory in order to establish simultaneous work processes for both remote and local users. Modules modi˜ed in this process are: termsrv.dll , csrsrv.dll , msgina.dll and winlogon.exe .If Carbanak detects the banking application BLIZKO (funds transfer software) in the infected computer, it sends a special noti˜cation to its C2 server. Carbanak is also aware of the IFOBS banking application and can, on command, substitute the details of payment documents in the IFOBS system.To communicate with its C2 server, Carbanak uses the HTTP protocol with RC2+Base64 encryption, adding additional characters not included in Base64.

      "18 Figure 10. Geographical distribution of victims according to C2 data 2.3 Lateral movement tools Carbanak uses different tools on infected systems, each one with a different purpose. There appears to be a preference for the Ammyy Admin remote administration tool for remote control. Speci˜cally, the attackers have been detected uploading:Ammyy Admin 3.5 (f8cd52b70a11a1fb3f29c6f89ff971ec) as svchost.exe It is believed that the attackers used this remote administration tool because it˚is commonly whitelisted in the victims™ environments as a result of being used˚regularly by administrators. In another instance, a Secure Shell (SSH) backdoor was used to communicate with the C2 server in 190.97.165.126 (operatemesscont.net). This indicates that the attackers did not limit themselves to Microsoft Windows environments. In this case, the victim used the Telnet/SSH client PuTTY to connect to the server, and the attackers recompiled the machine™s SSH daemon with a backdoor so they could gain direct access. Logs for these tools indicate that they were accessed from two different IPs, probably used by the attackers, and located in Ukraine and France. We have also found traces of many different tools used by the attackers inside the victim´s network to gain control of additional systems, such as Metasploit, PsExec or Mimikatz.\n",
      "192.4 Command and Control (C2) Servers There appear to be four distinct types of C2 servers: Linux servers used for issuing commands to deployed Carbanak instances and for receiving collected monitoring data; Windows servers used for remote connections to victim systems; Backup servers; and Drop servers where additional executable ˜les (e.g. remote administration tools) are hosted. Server rotation occurs more or less on a biweekly basis. For a complete list of identi˜ed Carbanak servers please check the regularly updated Carbanak IOC document. The current list of IOCs is provided at Appendix 3 in his document. Some of these C2 servers are responsible for dropping Ammyy (con˜guration and executable ˜les), the KLG plugin con˜guration (list of processes to monitor) and the VNC server (both 32 and 64 bits to be injected in rundll). In one of the observed servers there was also a Metasploit module. Figure 11. Carbanak administration panel running in Linux\n",

Carbanak administration panel running in Windows able to run RDP, VNC, proxy and tunnels via Carbanak Victim systems are catalogued in the servers™ databases. The victims belong to˚a number of different communities, thus simplifying administration. In all, 85˚different victims belonging to seven communities were found.\n",
      "21Attacker´s operational details Additionally, the malicious servers contain video ˜les that capture a victim´s activity. While the videos are stored using a compressed format which provides poor image quality, the selected format minimizes upload bandwith and is of suf˜cient quality for the attackers to understand the victims™ activities. The video ˜le naming conventions used the name of the application in the foreground (e.g., Outlook, Cmd, etc.) and only recorded user activity. This helped the attackers to both navigate to ˜les of interest and to discar Figure 14. Special video player designed to watch Carbanak´s video stream Using the intelligence gained from video and other monitoring techniques, the attackers developed an operational pictur, tooling and practices. This picture helps the attackers to deploy their malicious operations, for example:Attackers created fake transactions in the victim™s internal database after the˚veri˜cation process, thus avoiding discovery of the fraudulent activity; Attackers used the victim™s internal command utilities to insert fraudulent operations in the transaction queue. In general, the attackers demonstrated great versatility, using attack methodologies best suited to a speci˜c victim™s operational methodology. However, they seemed to deliberately limit the amount of money stolen per victim to $10 million USD. This limit may be explained as the maximum amount\n",
      "22of money that can be transferred via mule services, or the maximum amount of money that is budgeted in banks for fraud risks in order to minimize the chances of LEAs and the bank´s anti-fraud teams from doing a full blown analysis. Figure 15. List of PIN KVC used on ATMs Sensitive bank documents have be found on the servers that were controlling Carbanak. They included classi˜ed emails, manuals, crypto keys, passwords and˚so on. For example, the ˜le in the above ˜gure has KVC (key veri˜cation codes) keys that are used by ATMs to check the integrity of the PIN numbers of its users. In other cases involving ATMs, the criminals were able to control computers that had access to the internal ATM network. If the bank had enabled remote access to ATMs, the criminals started using this access to remotely withdraw cash. Criminals used no malware to operate the ATM dispenser; instead they used standard utilities to control and test ATM equipment.\n",
      "233. ConclusionsMalware targeting the ˜nance industry (both companies and consumers) continues to evolve. The Carbanak malware used in the on-going campaign described in this report has been very successful in terms of generating revenue. Of particular interest are the attack methods, similar to those used in sophisticated cyber-espionage APTs. As such, they represent a new and disturbing trend in the cybercrime market of increasing attack sophistication. Despite increased awareness of cybercrime within the ˜nancial services sector, it appears that spear phishing attacks and old exploits (for which patches have been disseminated) remain effective against larger companies. Attackers always use this minimal effort approach in order to bypass a victim´s defenses. Advanced control and fraud detection systems have been used for years by the ˜nancial services industry. However, these focus on fraudulent transactions within customer accounts. The Carbanak attackers bypassed these protections, by for example, using the industry-wide funds transfer (the SWIFT network), updating balances of account holders and using disbursement mechanisms (the ATM network). In neither of these cases did the attackers exploit a vulnerability within the service. Instead, they studied the victim´s internal procedures and pinpointed who they should impersonate locally in order to process fraudulent transactions through the aforementioned services. It is clear that the attackers were very familiar with ˜nancial services software and networks. As part of an automated reconnaissance phase, the Carbanak malware checked victim systems for the presence of specialized and speci˜c banking software. Only after the presence of banking systems was con˜rmed, were victims further exploited. To date, attacks against approximately 300 IP addresses around the world have been observed on analyzed C2s. It is possible that these attacks were coordinated to maximize returns prior to industry-wide information sharing and the implementation of countermeasures. Existing telemetry indicates that the Carbanak attackers are trying to expand operations to other Baltic and Central Europe countries, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Carbanak may be responsible for losses as high as $1 billion USD. We believe that the Carbanak campaign is a clear indicator of a new era in cybercrime in which criminals use APT techniques directly against the ˜nancial industry instead of through its customers. APTs are not only for stealing information anymore.\n",

      "Executive SummaryIn 2018  Cylance ® observed a decline in overall ransomware attacks  an increase in malicious coinminers  and a marked evolution of popular threats like Emotet . Overall malware attacks rose by 10% as attackers continued to hone their tools  skills  and tactics to threaten Windows  macOS  and various IoT platforms . Coinminers offer profit-driven threat actors certain advantages over ransomware  which Cylance believes were leading factors in their increase in popularity . First  they operate quietly by hijacking system processing resources for mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin  often without alerting the victim. Second  attackers can repurpose Coinhive Œ a tool intended to create alternative revenue streams for website owners Œ to install coinminers on victims™ browsers without consent. This year™s report o˝ers some insight into why the combination of readily available tools  the ability to conduct discreet operations  and the chance to reap the bene˛ts of hassle-free payouts made coinmining very popular among threat actors in 2018 . While ransomware attacks declined in popularity  and therefore in overall volume in 2018  they did remain a signi˛cant threat to the technology  consumer goods  and manufacturing industries according to Cylance data . Both PolyRansom and GandCrab ransomware ranked in Cylance™s top ten Windows-based threats . Additionally  there is still ample room for improvement in technology and tactics to respond to ransomware as the data tells us the average industry ransomware response clocked in at 25 days in 2018 . It™s worth noting that though ransomware attack volume may have decreased in 2018  ransomware attack sophistication increased last year . You™ll see this evidenced in Cylance™s accounts of how ransomware played a role in the high-pro˛le Lazarus Group attacks against Banco de Chile  and how ransomware families like Ryuk and UmbreCrypt were deployed by Emotet in 2018 . A heavily upgraded version of the Emotet banking trojan made a signi˛cant impact on the threat landscape in 2018 . Threat actors implemented analysis awareness  multi-layered command-and-control (C2) encryption  brute-force credential attacks  and full-body email harvesting capabilities into Emotet. Upgraded Emotet also leverages DKIM controls to bypass spam controls  uses PDFs to trigger malicious links  and functions as a modular attack platform . The Emotet threat platform uses a dynamic infrastructure that regularly updates malicious documents and rotates encryption keys . Cylance dedicated a section of this year™s report to Emotet  in part to outline how Emotet acts as a delivery agent for IcedID  Trickbot  Qakbot  and other threats in 2018 .In 2018  advanced persistent threat (APT) actors actively embraced tools and malware based on open source code like Mimikatz and HTran . The OceanLotus Group used customized backdoors and trojans like Remy  Roland  and Splinter in their campaigns against speci˛c targets . They also used custom encryption keys to obfuscate communications with their C2 servers and to complicate analysis of their activities . Meanwhile  other threat groups like The White Company carried out complex and sustained attacks against the Pakastani Air Force . This year™s report covers some of the basics you need to be aware of related to the new tactics and strategies deployed by these threat actors .The Cylance 2019 Threat Report represents the company™s piece of the overall cybersecurity puzzle . It details the trends observed and the insights gained  and the threats Cylance™s consulting team  research team  and customers encountered over the past year . Cylance shares this report in the hope that you will put it to good use in our collective ˛ght against the rising tide of cyber attacks worldwide .3\n",
      "A Look Back at Cylance™s Successful Predictions from Last Year's Report Firmware and Hardware Vulnerabilities: Last year™s threat report stated:  We anticipate that 2018 may present more real-world proof that attackers are looking to infect ˜rmware and hardware vulnerabilities in order to gain persistence or breach data.  On September 27  2018  Lojax1  the ˛rst UEFI rootkit was discovered in the wild .Destructive Attacks: Last year™s threat report stated:  Since the release of Shamoon in 2012  hostile attacks with the goal of destruction have been consistently emerging and causing havoc . . . We anticipate that in 2018  we will see more of these debilitating attacks designed to disrupt services and cause losses to the target.  On December 12  2018  a Shamoon variant attacked Italian oil services2.MethodologyCylance provides security solutions that are focused on protecting endpoints and servers from being compromised by advanced threats . Using a lightweight agent on the endpoint  when a threat is detected  information about the event Œ including telemetry data Œ is transmitted through encrypted channels to the customers™ private tenant in the Cylance cloud. This report is based in large part on this anonymized threat data collected between January 1 and December 31  2018 .1 https://arstechnica .com/information-technology/2018/10/first- uefi -malware-d iscovered-in-wild-is-laptop-security-software-hijacked-by -russians/2 https://www .reuters .com/article/us-cyber-shamoon/saipem-says- shamoon-variant- crippled-hundreds-of-computers-idU SKBN1OB2FA What is Predictive Advantage (PA)? Predictive Advantage is a unit of measurement applied to security solutions that measures  how far into the future its protection is seen to reach. For example  if it protected against a threat that was created one year after the product was built  then it would have a predictive advantage (PA) of 12 months.  3 Cylance™s malware PA scores re˙ect the time elapsed between the creation of a Cylance security model and the ˛rst documented emergence of that detected threat type .Why does PA matter? The PA unit of measurement provides insight into how advanced the machine learning training was for a particular security solution model . A model that can block a threat that arrives on the scene 24 to 30 months after that model was introduced can be considered a very robust and expertly trained model . Cylance invites you to learn more about this important method for evaluating AI-driven security solutions by reading the SE Labs test and report on the topic.3 https://www .cylance.com/content/dam/cylance-web/en- us/resources/knowledge-center/resource-library/reports/ SELabsPredictiveMalwareResponseTestMarch2018 Report.pdf ?kui=kMzpDSif2Olj Dv7c6GwpIA4\n",
      "New To This Year's Report: Execution  Identity  and DoS (E:I:D) RatingsIn our 2019 Report  Cylance rates each threat according to three categories: execution  identity  and denial of service (availability) . The E:I:D rating is intended to assist readers with quickly identifying and understanding the severity of a threat . The cumulative rating for each threat ranges from 1 to 10 with higher numbers representing more serious threats . For example  an E:I:D rating of 1 represents a low severity threat . An E:I:D rating of 10 would signify a high severity  high impact threat that can lead to system failures and widespread chaos .Execution (Integrity): This rating is a qualitative measure of the overall attack execution complexity . It includes measurements like uniqueness/ innovation  the level of user interaction required for the attack  and the di˚culty involved in remediating a successful attack . Identity (Con˜dentiality): This rating is a qualitative measure of how severely a threat impacts identity data. Threats have numerous ways of stealing identity information . Some only steal environmental artifacts while others may focus solely on harvesting PII or IP information . Some threats only impact ˛nancial data  while other threat families like backdoors or bots feature key-stroke logging capabilities that may or may not be utilized in an attack . A high identity rating indicates a threat that excels at identity-stealing activities.Denial of Service (Availability): This rating qualitatively measures the amount of downtime a threat imposes on users and machines  primarily through resource denial resulting in lost productivity . For example  a coinminer™s sole purpose is to utilize system resources to mine cryptocurrencies . Each resource stolen by the coinminer is one denied for legitimate business use. A ransomware or a disk wiper have the capability to deny data  or even an entire system  to victims. Some threats can deny network availability or participate in botnets that are used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks . The denial of service rating indicates how likely a threat is to impact daily operations and disrupt enterprise networks .Key Findings Ł Most popular infection vector: Phishing/email .Ł Malware attack volume increase: Cylance customers experienced a 10% overall increase in malware attacks in 2018 .Ł Top cyber attack industry targets: The top three targets among Cylance customers for cyber attacks were the food industry  logistics industry  and non-pro˛t organizations .Ł Top ransomware industry targets: The technology sector was the primary target for ransomware attacks in 2018 . Consumer goods and manufacturing placed second and third .Ł The rise of coinminers: Coinminer detections increased by 47% .Ł Coinminer industry targets: The top three targets of coinminers were the food industry  technology sector  and professional services .Ł OS X attacks: OS X was targeted by coinminers  adware  ransomware  and trojans .Ł IoT Attacks: The Mirai codebase is still being leveraged to launch attacks against IoT devices .5\n",

      "MyWebSearch Number of Variants: HighCylance Predictive Advantage: 782 days EID Rating:1 (E:1 I:0 D:0)Top Industries Impacted: Healthcare  manufacturing  and professional services MyWebSearch is a proli˛c nuisance that poses only marginal risks to infrastructure . It is a browser hijacker that typically modi˛es default browser settings without requiring human interaction .The browser modi˛cations generally display advertisements or influence search operations . Obvious signs of a MyWebSearch infection include the changing of a browser™s default home page or preferred search engine . MyWebSearch is often bundled with freeware and may use the signature of legitimate software to bypass security checks . MyWebSearch impacted the healthcare and manufacturing industries more than any other  though it impacted a wide swath of di˝erent industries across the board .Cylance collected over 17 000 variants of MyWebSearch in the past year . The MyWebSearch family likes to rotate the hashes to avoid detection . More than 88% of the hashes found infected 10 or fewer devices . This makes this threat a prime candidate for prevention . In calculations across a random sampling of the MyWebSearch data  Cylance was able to prevent this family at least 782 days in advance .

      "InstallCore Number of Variants: MediumCylance Predictive Advantage: 717 days EID Rating:1 (E:1 I:0 D:0)Top Industries Impacted: Consumer goods  education  and government InstallCore bundles legitimate software with unwanted products from their advertising partners . InstallCore primarily a˝ected the consumer goods  education  and government sectors in 2018 .InstallCore may use a legitimate signature from whichever primary software it installs . This signature borrowing allows InstallCore to operate without the host system raising red ˙ags. The unrequested software will ask for user permission before installing .Over 92% of InstallCore binaries were found on 10 devices or less  which shows that InstallCore likes to rotate its hashes with each bundled product . From a prevention standpoint  every variant that Cylance saw was prevented at least 717 days in advance  rendering them harmless to Cylance customers .InstallCore Target Breakdown By Industry PolyRansom Number of Variants: HighCylance Predictive Advantage: 862 days EID Rating:4 (E:2 I:0 D:2)Top Industries Impacted: Technology  government  ˛nance  and manufacturing PolyRansom  also known as Virlock and Nabucur  was a major threat by volume in 2018 and shows no signs of slowing down .

Government organizations were also a secondary  but signi˛cant  target of this malware .First observed in 2014 as Virlock  PolyRansom debuted a screen-locking functionality . PolyRansom displays a message falsely claiming to be authored by the  National Security Bureau  .

      "The malware generates new copies of itself  dramatically complicating the process of analysis and reverse engineering . Fortunately  the quality of PolyRansom™s encryption methods is inconsistent. Decryption tools have had some success recovering ˛les from infected systems . PolyRansom decrypts the minimal amount of code needed to operate  subsequently re-encrypting these code chunks as it continues its routine . This re-encryption of code alters the malware™s original binary image thereby changing its ˛le hash . This technique  called polymorphism  allows PolyRansom to evade signature-based threat detection . To propagate  PolyRansom injects itself into other ˛les then creates a weaponized executable or self-extracting RAR . This process allows PolyRansom to spread without being a true worm . Users launching the infected executables will cause the process to repeat  thereby spreading the malware across ˛le shares  cloud-based services  and other collaborative venues . PolyRansom contains other robust mechanisms for anti- analysis . These include anti-VM features  a customized packer  and the use of multiple packed/encrypted layers . PolyRansom sets the hidden attribute on ˛les and directories and uses .bat  .vbs  and .js scripting to avoid detection . PolyRansom is delivered via standard methods such as phishing and web-based attacks .

      "APT TRENDS IN2018Cylance monitored a number of advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns throughout 2018 and observed several notable trends .\n",
      "Tools and Malware Based on Open Source Code Cylance observed a visible shift among threat actors towards adapting publicly available code as an alternative to developing their own attack platforms . This approach saves attackers time and e˝ort while protecting their anonymity by making the attribution process more di˚cult . The Powersploit/Metasploit frameworks and Cobalt Strike Beacon remained popular  but Cylance noted an increase in the number of open source hacking tools used by several APTs . These tools include popular GitHub projects  such as Mimikatz (a credentials stealer) and HTran (a connection proxy tool)  and lesser known tools . APTs have access to numerous utilities like port scanners  network sni˝ers  and password bruteforcers whose code appears on online blogs and forums .Cylance also observed a rise in the prevalence of open source backdoors in APT campaigns . QuasarRAT  a remote administration tool written in .NET  has seemingly become a permanent part of the MenuPass/APT10 toolset . The Chinese PcShare backdoor was observed in a highly targeted campaign by another actor . These backdoors are often dropped during the early phases of the attack life cycle until a more bespoke solution can be deployed ..Bespoke Malware Many threat actors tend to use sophisticated and customized backdoors to maintain persistence in an environment . These backdoors are often designed based on information gleaned by the threat actors during reconnaissance . They are usually deployed in the advanced stages of the attack cycle . Backdoors may implement anti-detection tricks and bypass mechanisms tailored specifically to the software used on the targeted machine . They may also include a set of functionalities speci˛c to the victim™s pro˛le . A good example are the backdoors used in recent OceanLotus campaigns . These backdoors use malicious DLLs to mimic the names and exports of a legitimate library found in the targeted environment . By using DLL-sideloading techniques  the backdoor binary gets loaded to the memory by one of the victim™s benign applications .As modular architecture is becoming increasingly common  the foothold backdoors tend to be small and compact . Most of their malicious functionality relies on separate plugins  which can be immediately deleted from the system after being used . This allows the attackers to maintain basic persistence while keeping the digital footprint down to minimum . OceanLotus Group During an incident response investigation conducted late in 2017  Cylance threat researchers uncovered several backdoors deployed by the OceanLotus Group  which is also known as APT32 and Cobalt Kitty . Further e˝orts to analyze the tactics  techniques  and procedures of this threat group resulted in some signi˛cant revelations . Cylance observed the OceanLotus Group using obfuscated Cobalt Strike Beacon payloads to perform C2 and PowerShell one-liners to download and deploy malware . They leveraged obfuscators and re˙ective PE/shellcode loaders from exploit kits (including MSFvenom  Veil  and DKMC) to achieve ˛leless attack capabilities. Their attacks were highly tailored to speci˛c targets and included the development of remote access trojans Roland  Remy  and Splinter .For full details read Cylance™s report  The SpyRATS of O ceanLotus66 https://threatvector .cylance.com/en_us/home/report-the- spyrats-of-ocean lotus.html16\n",
      "C2 Communications Threat actors have been trying to protect or obscure C2 communications for many years  with varying degrees of success. The RedControle backdoor was recently observed modifying C2 commands by randomly inserting characters into command directives  in an attempt to evade HIDS/NIDS signatures . Other backdoors  like those from the OceanLotus Group  utilize a range of protocols including HTTP/S  DNS  and ICMP  and employ layers of encryption/compression . Often these attacks use custom encryption keys for each target . This makes the task of decoding commands to establish how a particular threat actor has been operating signi˛cantly more complex and time consuming .Novel and Complex Techniques Used To Fly Under the Radar Cylance researchers uncovered a novel payload loader that utilizes steganography to read an encrypted payload concealed within a .png image file. The steganography algorithm appears to be bespoke and utilizes a least signi˛cant bit approach to minimize visual di˝erences when compared with the original image . This approach is likely used to prevent analysis by discovery tools . Once decoded  decrypted  and executed  an obfuscated loader will load a variant of the Denes backdoor . The loader can be easily modi˛ed by threat actors to deliver other malicious payloads as well . The complexity of the shellcode and loaders shows that APTs continue to invest heavily in the development of bespoke tooling to evade detection .

      "Virus Cleaning Conundrum Last year  Cylance saw several parasitic infectors make its top 10 threat list . When parasitic infectors are successful in the wild  AV vendors receive a massive number of malware binary submissions. Cylance saw this happen with older threats that continue to make the rounds like PolyRansom  Ramnit  and Neshta. This infection-submission cycle also happens with classics like Elkern  Sality  and Virut . Cylance researchers observed several files containing portions of viral code offered for public consumption in software distribution channels . This appears to be a result of certain AV solutions that clean infected ˛les yet still leave traces of the malware infection intact . One nuance of AI- based security solutions is that they are sensitive to subtle ˛le modi˛cations. This sensitivity leads to ˛les previously cleaned by competitors™ AV being ˙agged as virally infected  due to the lingering malware artifacts . This creates a situation that could result in future embarrassment to both developers and AV vendors .The Year of Emotet If there is one threat that dominated 2018 in terms of propagation and persistence  it is Emotet . The Emotet of 2018 is a vastly di˝erent creature from the original 2014 version . It has evolved from a banking trojan into a robust and multi-faceted threat tool . Cylance observed numerous Emotet campaigns throughout 2018  a majority of which delivered additional (or later stage) malware payloads . Emotet has become a go-to tool for the distribution of Trickbot  IcedID  Qakbot  and many ransomware families .Emotet campaigns are run by well-resourced private entities demonstrating an above-average level of technical skills . Revenue for Emotet comes primarily from the rental and use of its infrastructure to spread and manage other malware and threat tools . Over the last year  both the Emotet infrastructure and malware have improved their ability to evade traditional controls . Compromised servers hosting malicious documents and executable payloads are managed and dynamically cycled . Obfuscation of the malware code and scripts in malicious documents is continually altered to complicate analysis and detection . Emotet infections generally begin with a phishing email containing a malicious document or a link to an infected document. While banking and invoice-themed lures are often used  the emails can be tailored to any subject or theme (holidays  etc .). The macros in the malicious documents are heavily obfuscated  often across multiple layers of encryption  substitution  and encoding. Emotet™s Invoke-Expression layers  string replacement routines  and obfuscation can foil standard security controls and detection methods . Cylance has also observed examples of code or commands being reversed (data reading from right to left) .The White Company In November 2018  Cylance released a report detailing the activities of a newly identi˛ed advanced persistent threat group  The White Company . This report o˝ers detailed analysis of this threat actor™s year-long campaign against the Pakastani Air Force (PAF) . The PAF is an integral part of the Pakistani nuclear weapons program and home to the country™s recently founded National Centre for Cybersecurity .The White Company may be state-sponsored  given the considerable resources they possess including: Ł Access to zero-day exploit developers and (potentially) zero-day exploits Ł A complex  automated exploit build system Ł The ability to modify  re˛ne  and evolve exploits to achieve mission-speci˛c needs Ł The capacity for advanced reconnaissance of targets For a full breakdown of this APT  read Cylance™s report titled The White Company: Operation Shaheen  Inside a New Threat Actor™s Espionage Campaign 7.7 https://pages .cylance.com/en-us-2018-11-operation- shaheen-threat-research-report-pdf-viewer .html?sfc=70144000 001N29gAAC 23\n",
      "Emotet payloads are often sandbox- / analysis-aware . Such examples have been observed abandoning execution or generating invalid indicators of compromise after detecting a sandboxed environment . Emotet payloads will typically establish persistence via the registry (Run key)  service creation  or scheduled task creation . The core banking-based module was removed from the executable Emotet payloads in 2017 . The current version is more open and modular . There are separate modules now for data theft and ex˛ltration  SPAM and email distribution  spreading (SMB-based worm functionality)  and more . Modules are handled and distributed in the form of DLL ˛les . Emotet also uses some open-source components . The current communication protocol is built on Google Protobuf . Emotet also uses LZMA (compression) and OpenSSL (encryption) . Threat actors made some changes to the C2 protocol of Emotet in 2018. The overall protocol structure (Protobuf) was tweaked  mail client strings were removed  and compression and encryption routines were updated . The updated encryption included a ZLIB-based request structure coupled with AES and RSA encryption. Emotet received new OS version data as well as a new miniupnp implementation (UPNP library) . Cylance observed various uses of this module  but it is typically used to evade ˛rewall rules by allowing port forwarding and binding to local ports. Additionally  there were updates to better obfuscate or mask code ˙ow to confuse analysis (over-padding with junk data and super˙uous jumps) .The key to Emotet™s success is polymorphism paired with dynamic binaries and infrastructure . Malicious document templates are typically rotated every ten minutes during active campaigns. All Emotet payloads are packed or encrypted with custom tools (for evasion and anti-analysis) . Encryption keys are rotated regularly . For example  the RSA keys used for communication between malware and C2 were frequently updated and rotated monthly  if not more often . Current variants also include updated password lists for the SMB spreading (brute-force) module as well as legacy Emotet spreader tools including: Ł Outlook Scraper˚Š˚ A name and address scraper targeting Microsoft Outlook accounts Ł WebBrowserPassView˚Š˚ A recovery tool for browser- based passwords Ł MailPassView˚Š˚ A recovery tool for email-client- based passwords Ł Netpass.exe˚Š˚ A Nirsoft tool to pull passwords from user session and external devices In October 2018  Cylance witnessed a functionality and feature update that allows Emotet to harvest full email message data from infected hosts . The trojan attempts to parse and ex˛ltrate full email body data (via Microsoft Outlook) for all emails over the past 180 days . The malware skims through the available messages in the IPM root folder . This new harvesting module copies the email data into a temporary ˛le  allowing up to 300 seconds for the process to complete . There are many obvious uses for this email data . One use  revealed later in 2018  was improving the e˚cacy of Emotet . The stolen email body data helped threat actors improve the social engineering success rate of Emotet™s campaigns . Possessing the real email data from infected environments allows attackers to better construct and target their phishing attacks . Properly spoofed emails also provide a way to bypass traditional spam ˛lters and email controls .   The key to Emotet™s success is polymorphism paired with dynamic binaries and infrastructure . Malicious document templates are typically rotated every ten minutes during active campaigns . 24\n",
      "Another highlight of the spam module was the implementation of Domainkeys Identi˛ed Mail (DKIM) . Cylance witnessed Emotet operators leverage DKIM to get around spam and email controls . With DKIM  the header of received email messages contain a public key certi˛cate that authorizes and validates the sender of the email . Through using a clever domain-hijacking trick  the operators were able to bypass controls (DMARC 8) and redirect the requests to specially crafted domains .Cylance observed Emotet spreading several threats in 2018  including Trickbot  AZORult  IcedID  Qakbot  Dridex  and various ransomware families (Ryuk  UmbreCrypt  and more) . Standard document ˛les were not the only method of delivery for the first stage of Emotet infections . Some malicious emails contained a link to the malicious document  while other campaigns used alternate ˛le types. Cylance has seen PDFs  XML Documents  and .js ˛les all used in malicious Emotet spam. Occasionally  speci˛c exploits within the target platform were leveraged by Emotet . Other times  ˛les were used to open malicious links (frequently the case with PDF ˛les) . Some emails contained obfuscated .js ˛les that generate HTTP GET requests to the front-line C2 server . These requests may be for further instructions  to download scripts  for PowerShell commands  for executable payloads  or other resources . The overall cost of Emotet grew in 2018 . An active Emotet infection will cost an organization nearly $1 million to clean up 9. Spotlight: Emotet and IcedID In 2018  Cylance observed a sizeable uptick in the delivery of IcedID as a late-stage payload for Emotet campaigns . IcedID  also known as Bokbot  was originally discovered in 2017 and has continued to evolve and ˙ourish among banking- focused trojan families . IcedID is a formidable threat on its own . However  in most of the campaigns Cylance observed  IcedID paired with more modular and scalable threats such as Emotet and Trickbot . While the initial focus of IcedID was the ˛nancial sector  Cylance has seen IcedID campaigns targeting other industries as well . IcedID expanded most heavily into the information technology  food  and agriculture industries .IcedID was originally discovered in mid-to-late 2017  with IcedID v2 following in mid-2018 . IcedID v2 introduced streamlined code  updated encryption  and obfuscation routines . IcedID v2 binaries are smaller  and the persistence mechanism was changed to a logon-based scheduled task. The v2 campaigns showed an increased focus on cryptocurrency exchanges and associated platforms . IcedID has its own spreading capabilities (LDAP with brute- force)  and special multi-step encryption routines to ensure each infection is unique and on the intended target . Perhaps the most interesting feature of IcedID is the included web 8 https://d marc .org/ 9 https://www .us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/ TA18-201A redirection and injection capabilities . These capabilities involve creating a local proxy for routing tra˚c . This proxy allows the malware to monitor and exfiltrate any data of interest . Browser sessions are also redirected by the proxy to fake phishing sites for credential harvesting and general data theft . IcedID can fool users by displaying the indicators of a secure session (SSL cert data  lock icon  etc.) as being present and intact. This gives browsing victims a false sense of security . IcedID was heavily distributed by Emotet throughout 2018  but the relationship is not exclusive . Cylance observed IcedID paired with Trickbot  Hancitor  Dreambot  and others as well .Quanti˛ed Increase in IcedID infections: Ł Q1 to Q2 2018 Œ 479% increase Ł Q3 to Q4 2018 Œ 316% increase Predictive Advantage vs . Emotet Emotet serves as a prime example of why prevention-based countermeasures and controls are required . Victims cannot wait a day or even an hour for a DAT/Signature update for their AV product . The AI models powering CylancePROTECT ® demonstrated an ability to stop Emotet over two years prior to its discovery in the wild .1010 https://threatvector .cylance.com/en_us/home/cylance-vs-updated- emotet.html25\n",
      "Attacks on O˚ce365- A View from Cylance™s Incident Response andContainment Team The Cylance Incident Response and Containment team responded to several attacks on O˚ce 365 over the past year . Microsoft O˛ce 365 (O365) Overview In 2018  Cylance saw an increase in phishing attacks  most of them focused on Microsoft O˚ce 365 (O365) credential harvesting .The attacks were often ˛nancially motivated . They involved man-in-the-middle attacks (injections into organizations™ wire-transfer processes)  changing employee direct-deposit payment information  and stealing intellectual property .O˛ce 365 Attack Summary Attackers send several phishing emails in an attempt to harvest user credentials . If successful  threat actors use the stolen credentials to gain access to an organization™s O365 environment .When attackers gain access to the O365 environment they typically create inbox forwarding rules that redirect email containing key phrases or words . For example  phrases such as  direct deposit    malware    wire transfer   and  payment  may trigger the email forwarding rule . Words that are indicative of intellectual property may also be used to ˙ag emails for redirection .The following sections detail some of the most common attack strategies observed by Cylance in 2018 .Direct Deposit and Payment Modi˝cations Direct-deposit-based attacks typically begin with the attacker sending phishing emails to obtain legitimate user credentials for the organization™s O365 environment .Once inside the environment  attackers create an inbox rule to delete any messages received that contain  direct deposit    payment election   or similar ˛nancial terminology . Attackers will also use the stolen credentials to abuse improperly con˛gured single sign-on (SSO) systems and authenticate to internal human resource systems  for example  WorkDay .Once the attacker gains access to WorkDay (or similar HR system)  they will modify the employee™s payment elections and change the bank account information to redirect payments .When the account information is successfully changed  the HR system noti˛es the user . However  because the attacker created an inbox rule to delete such emails  the user will never see this noti˛cation. The next time money is direct deposited it will go into the account con˛gured by the attacker .Wire Transfer Man-in-the-Middle Man-in-the-middle attacks also use phishing emails to gain legitimate user credentials to an organization™s O365 environment . With O365 man-in-the-middle attacks  Cylance typically sees two di˝erent scenarios . One approach involves attackers forwarding emails to an external email account via inbox rules  notifying the threat actors when a transaction occurs . The second method uses stolen user credentials to impersonate a legitimate user and proactively initiate wire transfers .Both methods are often successful and may escape the attention of organizations until a ˛nancial loss is incurred .26\n",
      "Intellectual Property Theft Intellectual property (IP) theft crimes are often ˛nancially motivated . Stolen IP is sold to third parties or occasionally used by attackers for a competitive edge . IP theft cases share many similarities with man-in-the-middle attacks . In both cases  attackers will phish for user credentials and abuse SSO to gain access to multiple systems .The attackers typically setup an inbox rule with keywords related to the IP they seek to steal . When an email matching the ˙agged words is sent or received  it is forwarded to an external email address for the attackers to review . Cylance has also investigated cases where the emails will be copied into an internal mail folder for the attacker to retrieve upon their next log in . Attackers also use harvested user credentials to authenticate to OneDrive and SharePoint  where they continue searching for IP to steal .Cylance has observed instances where the attacker will install OneDrive on another system and sync the compromised user™s OneDrive files to the external location . When this type of attack is identi˛ed  responders must undertake the tedious task of sifting through voluminous and complex O365 audit logs . Doing so manually takes signi˛cant time  risks the possibility that key activities are missed  and delays the scoping  containment  and remediation process .Cylance employs proprietary tools when responding to cloud security breaches of this nature . Cylance uses automated processes of data enrichment and normalization on logs to expedite recovery operations . Based on extensive cloud incident response and containment experience  Cylance has developed tools to: Ł Quickly ingest raw O365 Audit Logs Ł Restructure the O365 Audit Logs into an easy-to-digest structured data set Ł Apply geographic location tagging to client IPs within the log dataŁ Look for known-bad indicators of compromise via the CylanceINFINITYŽ Threat Intelligence database Ł Apply clustering models to the structured data to identify user authentication abnormalitiesŁ Provide context to the structured data to allow for faster processing by the Cylance Incident Response team Ł Apply human intelligence by having Cylance™s experienced specialists perform analysis on the processed and re˛ned data Microsoft O˚ce 365 Attack Prevention and MitigationRecommendationsOrganizations can take some immediate steps to reduce the chances of a successful attack and improve their prevention  detection  and response capabilities  including:Ł Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users Ł Enable MFA for all administrator accounts Ł Enable O365 Audit LoggingŁ Enable mailbox audit logging for all mailboxes Ł Enable Client Rules Forward Block Ł Review role changes weekly Ł Devise an incident response process Ł Review mailbox forwarding rules Ł Review malware detection reports Ł Review the risky sign-ins report within Azure Active Directory Ł Review consent grants Ł Con˛gure spam ˛ltering 27\n",
      "Finance and eCommerce in the Crosshairs From low-level ˛nancial fraud (e .g. carding  personal account theft  etc .) to sophisticated  nation-state-backed campaigns  the ˛nance industry remains under siege by cyber criminals . While numbers vary across studies and environments  Cylance data aligns with the following statistics: Ł $12M to $15M Œ The average annualized cost of cybersecurity per entity across all sectors/verticals Ł $19M to $20M Œ The average cost to the ˛nance/˛nancial services sector per cybersecurity breach Ł $2.5M to $3.5M Œ The average cost per entity to rectify a major malware-based event or incident Ł 25 days Œ The average time to remediate a catastrophic malware attack  including ransomware and related extortion attempts In 2018  Cylance observed the continued adoption of COTS tools  LOTL tactics  and open source tools by organized and nation-state-backed threat groups . Implementing a variety of threat tools can serve as a distraction technique while also helping attackers successfully execute a malware campaign . During the 2018 finance-focused campaigns  Cylance observed that: Ł Malware continued to reign as the preferred method of attack  followed by web-based threats (drive-by  watering-hole  etc .)  denial-of-service  and malicious insider attacks Ł Phishing/spear phishing remained the primary vector for most cyber attacks The most active malware families of 2018 for the ˛nancial sector ranged from trojans to ransomware  to the elaborate and targeted tools used in the HIDDEN COBRA campaign originating from within North Korea (DPRK) . For example  recent campaigns attributed to DPRK centered around the mining and theft of cryptocurrency 11. Malware families such as Emotet  Trickbot  Nanocore  and Adwind are also active players in the threat landscape .11 https://www .reuters .com/article/uk-southkorea-northkorea- cryptocurrency/south-korean-intelligence-says-n-korean-hackers- possibly-behind-coincheck-heist-sources-idU SKBN1FP2XXNotable Malware Families Emotet and IcedID As previously described in this report  Emotet and IcedID were major players in attacks on the ˛nancial industry in 2018 (see The Year of Emotet) .Trickbot Trickbot first appeared in 2016 as a banking trojan . Over the last year  Trickbot has rivaled Emotet in terms of self- propagation . Like Emotet  Trickbot steals and exposes sensitive information from infected targets . The hallmark capabilities of TrickBot include manipulation of network tra˚c  browser hijacking  credential harvesting  infecting connected devices  and downloading additional malicious code. Internal Cylance data suggests professional services  non-pro˛ts  and education will be the top targets for future Trickbot campaigns . Cobalt Group This threat group has increased its activity over the last year . The name refers to Cobalt Strike  a powerful o˝ensive computing platform originally designed for red-team exercises and pen-testing . It is a popular tool often credited with having unmatched evasion and persistence capabilities  two features highly attractive to cyber criminals . Recent attacks like SpicyOmelette12 illustrate a typical Cobalt Group attack pattern:Ł Send spear phishing emails containing a malicious PDF ˛le Ł Direct victims to an AWS-hosted site containing malicious codeŁ Use core Microsoft utilities to sign and run the malicious codeŁ Assume control of system activity Often the attackers will enable remote access to monitor various inputs and activities . The SpicyOmelette attack targeted payment system gateways  ATM machines  and other banking systems .12 https://www .zdnet .com/article/cobalt-threat-group-serves-up- spicyomelette-in-ban k-attacks/ 28\n",
      "HIDDEN COBRA and FASTCash Attacks originating from within DPRK 13 targeted banks in Asia and Africa  conducting tens of millions of dollars™ worth of fraudulent transactions from 2017 to 2018 . These attacks used remote connections to compromise application servers within the banking payment systems . According to a US-CERT alert14 in October 2018:  HIDDEN COBRA actors target the retail payment system infrastructure within banks to enable fraudulent ATM cash withdrawals across national borders . HIDDEN COBRA actors have con˛gured and deployed legitimate scripts on compromised switch application servers in order to intercept and reply to ˛nancial request messages with fraudulent but legitimate-looking a˚rmative response messages.  In addition  the FASTCash campaigns were one example of a string of cryptocurrency-focused attacks attributed to DPRK .Direct Targeting of Transaction/ Payment Infrastructure Over the years  there have been several attacks aimed at financial infrastructure . Threat actors™ attempts to compromise RBS and SWIFT systems continue to grow in sophistication and frequency . The falling prices of cyber threat services and widespread availability of malicious code lowers the barrier to entry for up-and-coming cyber criminals . In the last year  Cylance observed an increase in attacks against ˛nancial targets in Pakistan  India  South America  and others . In May 2018  Banco de Chile was targeted by the Lazarus Group . The attack employed both ransomware and wiper-based malware and resulted in costs estimated at nearly $10 million. In August 2018  the APT38 group targeted Cosmos Bank in India and caused roughly $13 .5 million in damage . Within the span of a few hours  APT38 was able loot millions through a combination of fraudulent ATM withdrawals and unauthorized SWIFT transactions . While examples of attacks on financial institutions are plentiful  the utter simplicity of these attacks often go unmentioned . A majority of these attacks begin with a simple spear phishing email. One bank employee opening the wrong email and clicking on the wrong attachment is all it takes to launch a malicious script. Once active in the infrastructure  malware can move laterally throughout an environment .Exploitation of vulnerabilities on external-facing services and applications are another popular malware delivery method  as are web-based attack vectors . The world can expect to see the same methods being used in future attacks as long 13 https://www .us-cert.gov/HIDDEN-COBRA-North-Korean-Malicious- Cyber-Activity 14 https://www .us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts /TA18-275A as they continue to produce reliable results . That being said  SWIFT has been actively promoting their Customer Security Programme (CSP) . Anyone using SWIFT services would bene˛t from a review of their materials and guidelines15.The Dark Web The Dark Web continues to be a primary source for fraud- focused tools and services . Visitors to the dark web can ˛nd an array of o˝erings from simple carding operations to elaborate a˚liate services . Recently  some criminals have lost trust in the dark web due to market takedowns and successful hosting scammers . Yet  the demand for an ecosystem that facilitates the exchange of illicit goods persists and this continues to fuel the dark web . Cylance witnessed a drop in the number of dark web open sellers and systems in 2018 . Many vendors have created barriers between themselves and potential clients . A vendor may advertise their service or contact information on the dark web to attract inquiries  then demand negotiations proceed through other channels . For example  a vendor may require discussions continue via direct email using a secure messaging service like Protonmail . Telegram  Wickr  and WhatsApp have also been observed as serving as alternative communication platforms . 15 https://www .swift.com/myswift/customer-security-pro gramme-csp   The Dark Web continues to be a primary source for fraud-focused tools and services . Visitors to the dark web can ˝nd an array of o˙erings from simple carding operations to elaborate a˛liate services . 29\n",
      "What Consumers Want When Cylance ˛rst considered o˝ering its arti˛cial intelligence technology to consumers  the company wanted to create a product and user experience people would love . Cylance knew its best bet was to go straight to the source . Cylance surveyed and talked to users from all walks of life to understand their attitudes and feelings towards the cybersecurity threats they faced . Here is what was discovered: The biggest demand for a new  innovative  consumer antivirus  came from enterprise customers . This seems surprising at first  but when one considers the fact that enterprise companies spent $114B16 on cybersecurity in 2018  it starts to make sense . Enterprise customers study cyber threat trends  assess risks facing their company  and eagerly seek new products and tools to improve their cybersecurity posture . With today™s workforce  enterprise security teams need to account for workers who are not con˛ned within the company- controlled corporate network . In fact  67% of workers use personal devices while at work 17. Another 37% of U .S. workers telecommute18. The widespread adoption of cloud-based software allows employees to access corporate assets from countless devices . This means the boundaries of a company™s network are no longer defined by the corporate firewall . It extends into their employees™ homes via their personal devices . Companies want their employees to be as safe at home as they are at work . In contrast to enterprise users  consumers expressed a general sense of frustration when it comes to cybersecurity . Although 97% of those surveyed said they use antivirus on their personal devices  51% had switched vendors 19 in the past year . Why? The primary reason for switching was due to their antivirus product failing to protect their computer . Another 43%20 anticipated they would likely switch in the future . When asked to rank their most pressing security concerns  identity theft and ˛nancial fraud were consistently ranked ˛rst and second 21. The debate over net neutrality and the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal brought privacy concerns once again to the forefront of consumers™ minds . Consumer frustration stems from a feeling of helplessness . It arises from a sense of being unable to protect themselves no matter what they do (or don™t do) . 16 https://www .gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-08-15- gartner-forecasts-worldwide-information-security-spending-to-exceed- 124-billi on-in-2019 17 https://www .cbsnews .com/news/byod-alert-confidential-data-on- persona l-devices/ 18 https://news .gallup.com/poll/184649/telecommuting-work-c limbs.aspx 19 Cylance  September 2017  internal Carbonview Survey: unpublished 20 Cylance  September 2017  internal Carbonview Survey: unpublished 21 Cylance  September 2017  internal Carbonview Survey: unpublished Why is there such a disparity between corporations™ and consumers™ attitudes towards cybersecurity? Enterprise security professionals know what they want  know what they must do  and can often take steps to improve their cybersecurity posture . Consumers feel like they do not have the time to keep up with cybersecurity or privacy trends  nor the knowledge to adequately protect themselves . In Cylance™s experience  consumers want the security product they select to do three simple things: Ł Protect what they have Œ Computers  mobile devices  tablets  and home electronics Ł Protect what they do Œ Online browsing  personal communications  shopping  and ˛nancial transactions Ł Protect who they are Œ Personal identity  login credentials  and privacy Cylance does not see any of those priorities and desires changing in 2019 as privacy and data concerns around the technology consumers use in their daily lives continue to mount. 30\n",
      "Notable Credential-Based Hacks of 2018 Š Why Authentication Matters Successful cyber attacks made headlines throughout 2018 . The unfortunate targets of these attacks included a major hospitality chain  Reddit  two large retailers  and hundreds of universities located around the globe .Universities Over 300 universities in the U .S. were targeted by Iranian attackers in 2018 22 . Of these targets  144 were compromised . The attackers relied on spear phishing emails containing malicious links to scam network login credentials from university personnel . Once the threat actors had working credentials  they could easily access the victim™s network infrastructure . A˝ected institutions su˝ered a combined loss of 31 terabytes of data and intellectual property estimated to be worth roughly $3 billion . The same threat group also attacked 176 universities in non-U .S. countries and 47 private companies.Reddit In another incident  the popular online platform Reddit su˝ered a credential-based attack that led to the compromise of user information and private communications 23. Reddit requires their employees to use two-factor authentication . By intercepting SMS veri˛cation messages  the attackers were able to gain read-only access to Reddit backup systems . The backup systems allowed the attackers to view account credentials  email addresses  and all private and public content stored on compromised systems . 22 https://www .wired .com/story/2018-worst-hac ks-so-far/ 23 https://www .theverge .com/2018/8/1/17639930/reddit-hack-security- breach-stole-user-data-20 07-earlier Marriott The Marriott Starwood Hotel chain disclosed a four-year breach in their reservation system that exposed up to 500 million customer records in 2018 24. The breach allegedly occurred when a cybersecurity vendor downloaded a malware sample  presumably for research . The malware sample managed to gain access to the Outlook Web Access (OWA) system at Marriott . The breach ultimately resulted in customer names  phone numbers  passport data  email addresses  and other PII being exposed 25.Lord & Taylor The popular luxury retailers Lord & Taylor and Saks su˝ered a breach a˝ecting more than ˛ve million credit and debit card numbers 26. The culprit was malicious software installed on cash registers that siphoned customer information . How the malicious software was installed on the point-of-sale systems remains unknown . Those involved with the remediation process suspect that successful phishing emails may have led to backdoors being installed on compromised systems . How Can the Security Industry Respond? For perspective on credential-based attacks  The Register27 reports that attackers trying to crack user accounts may generate 90% of online retail tra˚c . Given the frequency of credential-based attacks  it is unsurprising that cyber criminals landed so many large attacks in 2018 .Visionary cybersecurity companies are continuously exploring new and innovative ways to thwart cyber attacks . One remedy to the notable breaches of 2018 may be AI-driven behavioral analysis . Tactics like credential hijacking and malicious service account activity can be quickly detected by AI trained to identify anomalous behavior . When potentially dangerous system behavior is detected  early mitigation steps can be initiated before real damage occurs . 24 https://www .forbes .com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/12/03/ revealed-marriotts-500-million-hack-came-after-a-string-of-security- breaches/#1a b153b3546f25 https://www .ndtv.com/world-news/china-may-have-been-behind-the- massive-marriott-data-brea ch-1958945 26 https://www .nytimes .com/2018/04/01/technology/saks-lord-taylor- credit- cards .html27 https://www .theregister .co.uk/2018/07/20/credentials_lo gin_slurp/ 31\n",
      "ConclusionThe year 2018 offered a variety of cybersecurity lessons without being dominated by a single standout threat or threat group . Economic pressures favored the rise of coinminers early in the year  but those favorable winds have since reversed . The future of cyptocurrency™s value and its impact on the threat landscape throughout 2019 remain to be seen .Overall malware attacks within the Cylance ecosystem rose by 10% . Cylance™s 2018 observations concur with those made by the wider security industry; ransomware attacks are down and coinminer attacks are on the rise . The cunning cyber criminals behind Emotet kept the cybersecurity world on their toes with a relentless barrage of innovations . They demonstrated that security measures commonly considered reliable can still be tricked  bypassed  or broken by motivated threat actors . By hard-coding common passwords in their brute force attacks  they showed the world even the simplest tactics occasionally succeeded in 2018 . Enterprise users demonstrated an encouraging awareness and interest in emerging  AI-driven cybersecurity solutions  tools  and practices . Consumers reminded us that there is room to improve in informing the public on cybersecurity issues and directing them toward more e˝ective solutions . Cylance will continue to address the needs of both types of users by providing AI-native solutions to automate security for consumers and deliver cutting-edge prevention-based approaches for enterprises .Cylance Predicts While Cylance security solutions can claim a lab- veri˛ed prediction rate of 99.1%  Cylance™s engineers  researchers  and executives cannot make the same claim. Though their accuracy may not match Cylance™s products  Cylancers are not dissuaded from sharing their best guesses on upcoming security trends . In January  they made the following predictions for what™s ahead in 2019: Ł We will witness a major infrastructure outage (power  water  gas  transportation  etc .) caused by a security issue in the industrial control space. This may be the result of a proli˛c malware attack or a direct attack . In either case  there will be signi˛cant ˛nancial or human costs .Ł In the E.U.  we will see a rise in GDPR enforcement based upon controllers and processors failing to provide adequate security .Ł In the U.S.  individual states  not the federal government  will largely drive privacy regulation .Ł We will see an increased focus on implanting hardware with threats as a result of the Bloomberg SuperMicro article28.Ł There will be a surge in security intelligence  particularly as it relates to data that scales beyond human comprehension . In 2019  more data sources will become integrated  resulting in larger data volumes . Dependencies on APIs that facilitate these data integrations will grow as well  forcing security practitioners to innovate new ways to approach their environments .Ł Extortion will become the shortest path to monetizing malspam campaigns based around Emotet and repurposed Dridex/Dyre variants . The malware™s ability to insta-ex˛ltrate emails and user credentials will allow attackers to quickly extort users with information discovered in stolen emails . This approach may be found preferable to the risks involved with encrypting data and demanding (trackable) cryptocurrency payments .Ł Attackers may begin to leverage alert-fatigue against enterprise targets . Threat actors may strike boldly then use the resulting noise as a diversion to distract from their actual objective . They may also seek to exhaust threat responders with a ˙ood of alerts  knowing that millions29 of cybersecurity positions remain un˛lled .28 https://www .bloomberg .com/news/articles/2018-10-09/ new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in- u-s-telecom 29 https://www .forbes .com/sites/ forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent- gap-is-an-industry-crisis/#49 77d505a6b3 32\n",
